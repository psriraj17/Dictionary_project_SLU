PART ONE    Mosque    CHAPTER ONE    'Hamidullah!' cried the young man. 'Am I late?'  'Do not apologise,' replied his host. 'You are always late.'  'Yes, but has Mahmoud Ali eaten all the food? Mahmoud Ali, how are you?'  'Thank you, Dr Aziz, I am dying.'  'Dying before dinner? Poor Mahmoud Ali!'  'We are having a very sad talk,' said Hamidullah. 'We were discussing whether it is possible to be friends with an Englishman. Mahmoud Ali says no, but I say yes.'  'For example,' said Mahmoud Ali, 'the red-nosed boy has insulted me again in court. I don't blame him. Until recently he was quite a nice boy, but the others have influenced him.'  'I agree that you can't be friends with them here,' said Hamidullah. 'Only in England. Years ago, at Cambridge, Mr and Mrs Bannister were my dearest friends! And when the English first come out here, they can be quite nice. You won't believe me, but Turton and I were quite intimate when he first arrived. He showed me his stamp collection. When any Englishman comes to India he is pleasant for two years. Englishwomen are only pleasant for six months.'  Hamidullah called out, 'When will dinner be ready?' The servants shouted back that it was ready. They meant that they wished it was ready. Everybody understood this, so nobody moved.    'When I was at Cambridge,' said Hamidullah, 'I stayed with Mr and Mrs Bannister during the vacations. I often took their children out. I remember taking little Hugh to Queen Victoria's funeral.'  'Queen Victoria was different,' murmured Mahmoud Ali.    'Let's not talk about the English,' said Aziz. 'Queen Victoria and Mrs Bannister were the only nice ones, and they're both dead.'  'No, I have met others,' said Hamidullah.  'So have I!' said Mahmoud Ali, and the mood changed. They recalled little kindnesses and courtesies, but after a while they could think of no more examples.    A servant announced dinner. They ignored him. 'Come and see my wife,' said Hamidullah to Aziz. Hamidullah Begum was Aziz's aunt, so he was allowed behind the purdah. Hamidullah Begum talked to Aziz for a long time. She said he should marry again. If men do not marry. she argued, women will never have the joys of being a mother. Aziz did not wish to discuss marriage. He had been married once, but his wife had died. His three children now lived with their grandmother. Respectful but irritated, Aziz told his aunt, 'Once is enough.'    Hamidullah and Aziz left the ladies and sat down to dinner with Mohammed Latif, a poor relation who lived with Hamidullah. This gentle, happy, and dishonest old man had never worked in his life. Aziz teased him a little, then started reciting poetry: Persian, Urdu, a little Arabic. As they listened to the poetry, India seemed to be united and their own. A servant interrupted them and gave Aziz a note.    'Dr Callendar wants to see me,' said Aziz in disgust.    Aziz rode off at high speed, but on the way one of his tyres went flat, and Aziz had to look for a tonga. As the tonga entered the Civil Station, Aziz felt suddenly depressed. The roads - named after victorious English generals and intersecting at right angles - were symbolic of the net Great Britain had thrown over India Feeling caught in the net, Aziz rang the doorbell of the Civil Surgeon's house. The Civil Surgeon was out.  'But surely he left me a message,' said Aziz.  The servant said no. Just then, two English ladies came out. Aziz raised his hat, but the ladies ignored him. Turning to her friend, Mrs Callendar said, 'There's a tonga Mrs Lesley!'  'Is it ours?' asked Mrs Lesley.  'Take the gifts the gods provide!' and the two ladies climbed onto the tonga. 'Club!' called Mrs Callendar to the driver.  Aziz said to the driver, 'Go. I will pay you tomorrow.' As the tonga drove off, Aziz cried, 'You're welcome, ladies!' They did not reply.  He walked quickly down the hill away from the Civil Station, and entered a mosque to rest. He had always liked this mosque. He sat on the wall and looked into three arcades whose darkness was illuminated by the moon. Here was Islam, his own country. It was more than a faith - it was an exquisite and durable attitude to life, where his body and his thoughts found their home.  'One day,' he thought, 'I too will build a mosque. I will be buried there, and above my tomb will be a Persian inscription:    'Alas, without me for a thousand years  The Rose will blossom and the Spring will bloom,  But those who have secretly understood my heart  Will approach and visit the grave where I lie.'    The secret understanding of the heart! He repeated the phrase with tears in his eyes, and as he did so one of the pillars of the mosque seemed to move. Then an Englishwoman stepped out into the moonlight. Suddenly he was furious. 'Madam!' he cried.  'Oh!'  'Madam, this is a mosque. You have no right to be here. You should have taken off your shoes.'  'I have taken them off.'  'You have? Then I beg your pardon. Ladies often forget, especially if they think that no one is here to see.'  'That makes no difference. Cod is here.'  'Madam! Oh, can I be of service to you now or at any time? May I know your name?'  She was now in shadow, so he could not see her face, but she saw his and said in a gentler voice, 'Mrs Moore.'  He walked towards her and saw that she was old, with a red face and white hair.  'Mrs Moore, I'm afraid I surprised you. I shall tell our community about you. I think you are newly arrived in India.'  'Yes - how did you know?'  'By the way you address me. Can I call you a tonga?'  'No. I walked here from the Club. They are doing a play that I have already seen.'  'You should not walk alone at night, Mrs Moore. There are bad characters about, and leopards and snakes may come from the Marabar Hills.'  'But you walk alone,' said Mrs Moore.  'Oh, I am used to it.'  'Used to snakes?'  They both laughed. 'I am a doctor,' he said. 'Snakes won't bite me.'  They sat down in the entrance and put on their shoes. 'Tell me, Mrs Moore, why have you come to Chandrapore?'  'To visit my son, the City Magistrate.'  'But our City Magistrate's name is Mr Heaslop.'  'Yes. I was married twice.'  'And your first husband died?'  'Yes, and so did my second husband.'  'And have you any other children?'  'I have two younger ones - Ralph and Stella. They are in England.'  'What a coincidence! I too have two sons and a daughter.'  'What are their names? Not Ronny, Ralph and Stella?'  The suggestion delighted him. 'No, indeed. My children are called Ahmed, Karim and Jamila.'  They rose to leave. 'If you like,' said Aziz, 'I will show you the Minto Hospital. I have nothing else to offer.'  'I'm sorry. I have seen it already. Mrs Callendar took me.'  His voice became sarcastic. 'Mrs Callendar! A very charming lady!'  'I don't find her charming.'  'She has just taken my tonga!' cried Aziz. 'And every night her husband interrupts me when I am dining with my friends. I go immediately, but he is not there and does not even leave a message!'  She listened.  He was excited partly by the insults he had received but much more by the knowledge that someone sympathised with him. Though his words were angry, his heart was happy. 'You understand me!' he said. 'You know what I feel! If only others resembled you!'  Rather surprised, she replied, 'I don't think I understand people very well. I only know whether I like or dislike them.'  'Then you are an Oriental.'  He walked back to the Club with her. At the gate, she invited him in. 'Indians are not allowed in,' he said, but his voice was no longer angry.  As Mrs Moore re-entered the Club, she heard Adela Quested say, 'I want to see the real India.' Adela was the girl who had travelled from England with Mrs Moore. Ronny had asked his mother to bring Adela to India. Ronny and Adela were thinking of getting married.  'I want to see it too.'  'Where have you been? Did you see the moon reflected in the Ganges?'  'I went to a mosque.'  Ronny called out to a man passing by, 'Fielding! How does one see the real India?'  'Try seeing Indians,' the man answered, then he disappeared.  'Who was that?'  'Our school teacher at Government College.'  'One cannot avoid seeing Indians,' said Mrs Lesley.  'But I want to see them,' said Adela.    Other ladies joined them, amused that someone wanted to see Indians. Wanting to see Indians! How new that sounds!' cried one.    Another more serious lady explained, 'Natives do not respect you more after meeting you.'  'That occurs after so many meetings,' Adela replied.  But the lady, entirely stupid and friendly, continued, 'I was a nurse in a Native State before my marriage. I had a lot of contact with Indians then. I found the only thing to do was to be cold and reserved.'  'Even with your patients?'  Mrs Callendar said, 'The kindest thing you can do to a native is to let him die.'  'And what if he went to heaven?' asked Mrs Moure, with a gentle smile.  'He can go where he likes, so long as he doesn't come near me.'  The Collector, Mr Turton, came up and said, 'If you really want to meet Indians, Miss Quested, I can organise a Bridge Party.'  He explained that a Bridge Party was not for playing cards but to bridge the gulf between East and West.    As they left the Club, Mrs Moore looked out of the carriage window at the pale yellow radiance of the moon in the purple sky. In England the moon seemed dead and alien Here Mrs Moore felt part of the night, together with the moon and the stars. Then she saw the mosque.    'That's where I went,' she said.  'You can't walk alone at night here, Mother,' said Ronny. 'There are snakes.'  'Yes. The young man told me.'  'What young man?' asked Adela. 'Was he nice?'  'Very nice,' said Mrs Moore.  'Who was he?' asked Ronny.  'A doctor. I don't know his name.'  'Was he at the Club?'  'No. He said he wasn't allowed in.'  'Not a Moslem? Why didn't you say he was a native? You shouldn't have spoken to him.'  'Why not?' asked Miss Quested. She was irritated with Ronny. But she turned to Mrs Moore with a smile and said, 'While I was talking about seeing the real India, you went out and saw it, and then you forgot about it!'  Later that night Ronny and Mrs Moore had a talk. Ronny was curious to know who his mother had met and realised that it had been Aziz.      CHAPTER TWO    The Bridge Party was not a success. The Nawab Bahadur went to it and because he had accepted the invitation, others in the Indian community accepted also. His opinion was respected. He was a rich man and a philanthropist. He and his elegant grandson Nureddin stood on one side of the lawn outside the Club, surrounded by other Indians.  On the other side of the lawn Mrs Turton sat in a chair, surrounded by other English people. She was 'saving herself up' for some future occasion. Most of her public appearances were characterised by this air of reserve.  Mrs Moore and Adela tried to talk to some of the Indian ladies while Mrs Turton watched disapprovingly, but the ladies were polite and shy, and soon the conversation came to an end.  When the Bridge Party was over, Adela stood at the window of the Club, looking out at the Marabar Hills. Mr Fielding came up to her and said, 'Your friendliness gave great pleasure to our Indian guests.'  'I'm so glad,' said Adela. 'This party made me feel ashamed of the other English people. You, Mr Turton, and Mr McBryde were the only ones who were even polite.'    'Would you like to come to tea at Government College on Thursday?' asked Fielding. 'I could invite my assistant. Professor Godbole. And, if you like Indian music, we could ask him to sing.'  'That would be nice.'    'Shall I invite other Indians?'  'Do you know Dr Aziz?'  'No,' said Fielding. 'I have heard of him, but I have never met him. Shall I invite him too?'  'Yes. Mrs Moore says he is very nice.'  'Then I will certainly invite him.'  Back in their bungalow that evening, when Adela had gone to bed, Mrs Moore had a conversation with her son.  'Does Adela talk to you?' he began. 'I have so much work to do, I don't see her as much as I had hoped.'  'Yes,' replied Mrs Moore. 'Mostly we talk about India.'  'Do you think she is worried about anything?'  'She thinks the English people here are unpleasant to Indians.'  'We're not out here to be pleasant to Indians, Mother. We're out here to do justice and keep the peace.'  'The English are out here to be pleasant,' said Mrs Moore. 'Because India is a part of the earth, and God has pul us on earth to be pleasant to one another. God... is... Love.'  Ronny looked sad and a little anxious. Perhaps his mother was ill. She always talked about religion when she was ill.  Mrs Moore felt she had made a mistake in mentioning God. She should have kept to the real subject of her visit to India: the relationship between Ronny and Adela. Now she asked herself, 'Will they, or will they not, become engaged to be married?'      CHAPTER THREE    Fielding had come to India when he was over forty. He had travelled a lot before he got the job at Government College. He was used to different kinds of people, and he enjoyed getting to know Indians. But he found that the other English people in Chandrapore disapproved of this. A joke he made at the Club one evening gave him a bad reputation. He said with a laugh that the so-called white race was really pinkish- grey. He did not realize that the symbolic value of the word 'white' was very important to the Anglo-Indians. It was scandalous to put the word 'white' into question. He realized that he could not be friends with Indians if he wanted to be liked at the Club. But he did not want to give up his Indian friends, so he lived between the two worlds.  His house at Government College was a beautiful old building in an ancient garden. Fielding was dressing after a bath on Thursday afternoon when Aziz arrived. He called through the bedroom door, 'Please make yourself at home.'  'How kind of you, Mr Fielding,' said Aziz. 'I am so pleased to meet you! I hear that you love Persian poetry and are interested in the Moghul Emperors. I am very interested in these things too. Don't you think that India must have been beautiful then?'  Fielding came out of the bedroom and said, 'Yes. It must have been splendid.'  'Who else is coming to tea?' asked Aziz.  'Two ladies - Mrs Moore and Miss Quested, and my assistant Narayan Godbole.'  Just then Mrs Moore and Miss Quested came in. Aziz found it easy to talk to them. Mrs Moore was so old and Miss Quested so plain that he felt entirely relaxed.  'How pleasant this is!' said Aziz. 'We must meet again, perhaps for tea at my house.'  Miss Quested asked for his address. Aziz thought of his bungalow. It was so small and dirty! He could not invite English ladies there. His comment had been made impulsively. He had not really intended to invite them to his house.  'But my bungalow is so poor. Not like this beautiful house. Let's look at it together. Look at the curves of the arches. How delicate they are! And the pillars, all painted blue. And see how the house opens out onto the garden, so that we can see the mango tree and breathe the fresh air! Mrs Moore, now you are really in India!'  He spoke with great enthusiasm about the past and the beauties of India. Professor Godbole arrived and took his tea. Polite and enigmatic, he listened to Aziz. He was an old Brahman with a grey moustache, grey-blue eyes, pale skin, and a purple turban. His whole appearance suggested harmony. He ate and smiled in silence.  'Miss Quested!' said Aziz. 'You must stay in India until the mangoes are ripe. They are so delicious! Why don't you stay in India forever?'  'I'm afraid I can't do that,' said Adela, then she realised that what she had said was important and should have been addressed to Ronny.    Mrs Moore asked Fielding to show her round the college. Everyone rose except Professor Godbole, who was finishing a banana.    When Fielding and Mrs Moore had left, Professor Godbole said to Adela, 'I shall send you some Indian sweets. I will give myself that pleasure.'    'Professor Godbole's sweets are delicious,' said Aziz sadly. He wanted to send sweets too, but he had no wife to cook them. 'I'm so sorry that t have nothing to give you.'    'But you have kindly invited us to your house,' said Adela.  He thought again of his bungalow with horror. 'Yes, yes!' he cried, then added in desperation, 'I invite you to visit me in the Marabar Caves.'  'Thank you. I have never heard of the Marabar Caves. What are they?'  Aziz tried to explain, but he had never been to the Marabar Caves, so he turned to Professor Godbole for help.  He described them very vaguely, so Aziz asked him again to say something more.  'It will be a great pleasure.' He renounced the pleasure. Aziz realized that he was reluctant to describe them. He was concealing something. Aziz kept asking questions and Professor Godbole kept evading them.  By the end, Aziz still had no idea what was extraordinary about the Marabar Caves.    Just then Ronny appeared. Obviously annoyed, he called from the garden, 'Where's Fielding? Where's my mother?'    'Good evening!' said Adela coldly.  'You and my mother must come with me now. We are going to watch the polo.'  Professor Godbole stood up and said, 'Your mother will return soon, sir.'  Ronny ignored him. He spoke to Adela as if the two Indians were not there. Aziz disliked being ignored. For the last hour, he had been the center of attention. The atmosphere had been intimate. He had not risen with Professor Godbole, and now he spoke to Ronny with impertinent friendliness. 'Come and join us, Mr Heaslop, until your mother returns.'  Ronny did not reply. He asked Fielding's servants to find their master at once. As Fielding walked back towards the house, he saw his guests through the beautiful blue arches. It was like a scene in a play - Aziz being impertinent, Ronny furious, Adela perplexed by the sudden ugliness, and the Brahman observing all in silence.  Ronny and his ladies prepared to leave.  'Goodbye, Dr Aziz.'  'Goodbye, Miss Quested. Don't forget about the caves. I'm sorry you leave India so soon!'  'Goodbye, Professor Godbole,' she continued, suddenly agitated. 'I'm sorry we never heard you sing.'  'I may sing now,' he replied, and he did.  His thin voice rose. It was like the song of an unknown bird - charming and strange. It continued for some time and then it stopped.  'Thank you so much. What was that?'    'I will explain in detail. It was a religious song. I sing the part of a milkmaid. I say to Shri Krishna, 'Come! Come to me!' The God refuses to come. This is repeated several times.'    'But He comes in some other song, I hope,' said Mrs Moore gently.  'Oh no. He refuses to come,' repeated Godbole. 'I say to Him, 'Come, come. come, come.' He does not come.'    Ronny's steps died away, and there was a moment of absolute silence.    Adela was furious with Ronny. How rude he had been at Mr Fielding's! He had interrupted the conversation, and he had walked away in the middle of Professor Godbole's song. In the carriage on the way to the polo they argued about the expedition to the caves. Ronny did not want them to go. 'Indians are incapable of organising anything,' he said. 'The expedition will be a disaster.'  Mrs Moore said she did not want to watch the polo. She preferred to be left at the bungalow.  The young people felt ashamed. They left Mrs Moore at the bungalow and went to the playing field. They sat down under a tree. The game was nearly over, and they watched with little interest. Adela said. 'We must have a serious talk, Ronny. I have decided that we are not going to be married, my dear boy.'  The news hurt Ronny very much. He said gently, 'You never promised to marry me, my dear girl.'  She felt ashamed. How decent he was! 'I'm sorry to have given you and your mother all this trouble for nothing. Can we remain friends?'  'Of course we can.'  'We're being very British about it.'  'Well, we are British.'  'I think we will always be friends.'  'Yes.'  A wave of tenderness passed through them. They began to feel lonely and unwise.  'Good evening!' said the Nawab Bahadur, coming up to them. He pointed out his new car and offered to take them out in it. Ronny was beginning to feel ashamed of his rudeness to Aziz and Godbole, so he accepted the invitation. The Nawab sat in the front, beside the driver. Ronny and Adela sat in the back. The old man told his driver to go down the Gangavati road, then he went to sleep. Ronny knew that the Gangavati road was being repaired, so he told the driver to take the Marabar road instead. Darkness fell as they drove along. Adela's hand accidentally touched Ronny's.  Just then the car hit something, and they crashed into a tree. The Nawab awoke and cried out in Arabic.  'Are you frightened, Adela?' asked Ronny.  'No.'  'You should be frightened!' cried the Nawab.  'The driver must have lost control of the car,' said Ronny.  'No. It wasn't that,' said Adela. 'We ran into an animal. A large animal ran up and hit the car. I saw its hairy back.  The old man gave a loud cry. His terror seemed excessive and ridiculous. 'This happened because you took the Marabar road.' he said to his driver angrily.  'That's my fault,' said Ronny, and he explained.  They saw a car approaching, and Ronny stepped into the road and waved. It was Miss Derek. She stopped and they all got in. As Ronny and Adela got out in front of their bungalow, their hands touched again. 'Ronny,' said Adela, 'I would like to take back what I said when we were watching the polo.'  He assented, and they became engaged to be married in consequence.  They went into the bungalow to tell Mrs Moore the good news. Then they told her about the accident. 'The old man was ridiculously upset about it,' Ronny concluded.  Mrs Moore trembled. 'A ghost!' she said.  'Why do you say that?' asked Adela. 'It was probably a hyena.'    'Ah yes it probably was.'  In his house in Chandrapore, the Nawab was preoccupied. Nine years previously, when he had first had a car, he had driven it over a drunken man and killed him. The man's ghost had been waiting for him ever since. The Nawab was innocent before God and the Law. He had paid twice the compensation necessary to the man's family. But the man's ghost continued to wait for him close to the scene of his death. None of the English people knew about this. He only told those who were closest to him. Now he spoke in horror of the particular circumstances He had led others into danger. He had risked the lives of two innocent and honored guests. His listeners shook their heads. 'May God have mercy,' they said.    Three days after Fielding's tea party Aziz lay in bed, ill. It was a little fever. When he heard guests arriving, he felt suddenly worse.  Hamidullah came in with Syed Mohammed, the assistant engineer, Rafi, the engineer's nephew, and Mr Haq, the police inspector. They sat on his bed and talked. The room was small and dirty with many flies.  Just as they were beginning a stupid argument, Fielding walked into the room saying, 'Is he ill or not?'  'Sit down,' said Aziz coldly. He felt ashamed of his bungalow and his friends.  Hamidullah offered Fielding a cigarette. Fielding accepted. He liked the pleasant sensitive lawyer. 'He is ill and he is not ill, as we all are The whole world seems to be dying, yet it doesn't die,' said Hamidullah, 'so there must be a benevolent God. Don't you agree?'  'No, I don't,' said Fielding. 'The world is not dying and I don't believe in God.'  Aziz and the others were scandalized.  'Is it true that most people in England are atheists now?' asked Hamidullah.  'Most thoughtful people, yes.'  'And doesn't morality also decline?'  'Yes - I suppose it does.'  'Excuse the question but. if this is the case, how is England justified in ruling India?'  'I don't know,' said Fielding. 'I'm here because I need a job.'  'Qualified Indians also need teaching jobs.'  'I got there first,' said Fielding, smiling.  'But is it fair that an Englishman should have a job in India when Indians are available? Of course I mean nothing personal. Personally, we are delighted that you are here.'  'I'm delighted to be here too. That's my only excuse.'  'And those Englishmen who are not delighted to be here?' asked Hamidullah.  'Throw them out.'  'We don't believe in throwing people out,' said Mr Haq. 'We Indians are so spiritual.'  'We are not spiritual,' said Hamidullah. 'We are just inefficient. You and I should be at a meeting of the Committee of Notables, but we aren't. Dr Lal should be attending to his patients, but he isn't.'  'Anyway,' said Fielding, 'we are tiring the invalid. We should leave now.'  They rose and said goodbye. Fielding felt disappointed in the visit. He had liked Aziz so much when they had met at the tea party. Now here he was in the terrible heat, waiting for Aziz's servant to bring his horse. The others had all left. Then he heard Aziz calling him.  He went back into the bungalow and found Aziz sitting up in bed, looking miserable. 'Here's your famous Eastern hospitality!' cried Aziz sarcastically. 'Look at the flies! Look at the squalor!'  'You must rest, Aziz,' said Fielding.  'Obviously you want to leave. But before you go, open that drawer and take out the photograph.'  Fielding opened the drawer and found a photograph of a woman in a sari, facing the world.  'Who is this?'  'She was my wife. You are the first Englishman who has ever seen her. Now put her photograph away.'  'I don't know why you pay me this great compliment, Aziz,' said Fielding, 'but I do appreciate it.'  'All men are my brothers and, when one of them behaves as such, he can see my wife.'  'And when the whole world behaves as such, will there be no more purdah?'  'I showed you the photograph because you can say and feel a remark like that,' said Aziz. 'I showed her to you because I have nothing else to show. I have no other secrets.'  Fielding sat on the bed, pleased that Aziz had such trust in him.  'Why aren't you married?' asked Aziz.  'The lady I liked didn't want to marry me. That was fifteen years ago.'  'But you have no children, so your name will die out.  'Yes.'  Aziz shook his head. 'How can you be so indifferent ahout it?' he said. 'Why don't you marry Miss Quested?'  'Oh, no! She's too serious. Anyway, she is engaged to marry the City Magistrate.'  'Is she? Oh well. Never mind. She has very small breasts. If you come with me to Calcutta, I shall find you a lady with breasts like mangoes!'  Fielding smiled, but he thought it bad taste to refer to a lady's breasts.  'No, you won't.'  'You are right. It might get you into trouble. Then you might lose your job.'  'If I do, I shall survive it. I travel light.'  'Travel light! You are a most extraordinary race. Is it your climate or what?'  'Plenty of Indians travel light too - holy men, for example. Any man can travel light until he has a wife and children. I'm a holy man minus the holiness.'      PART TWO    Caves    CHAPTER FOUR    The Marabar Hills are very ancient. The sea has never covered them. They were there before the Himalayas rose out of the ocean and before the Indian subcontinent broke off from Africa.  The caves are easily described. A tunnel leads to a circular cave about six metres in diameter. This is a Marabar cave, and there are many of them, exactly the same, in the Marabar Hills. The caves are dark. When a visitor arrives, he lights a match. The flame is reflected on the walls of the cave, which are smooth.  It illuminates the colours in the smooth granite of the wall - delicate stars of pink and grey. Then the match burns out and the cave is dark again like all the other caves.  Early one morning, Aziz and Mohammed Latif went to the train station to wait for the guests. Although his friends had advised him against it, Aziz was taking Mrs Moore, Miss Quested, Fielding and Professor Godbole on an expedition to the Marabar Caves. The ladies were the first to arrive, accompanied by their servant Antony. Aziz had been nervous, but now he was suddenly happy. 'Ah, you are here! This is the happiest moment in my life!' he cried. 'Send back your servant. Then we shall all be Moslems together!'  'Antony, go home,' said Adela.  'Master told me to come,' he replied.  Mohammed Latif gave Antony some money, and Antony left.  Aziz was getting nervous again. Fielding and Godbole had not yet arrived and it was almost time for the train to leave. He took the ladies onto the train and made them comfortable. Then he went back outside to wait for Fielding. But just then the train started to move. Aziz and Mohammed Latif leapt onto the moving train. 'Mr Fielding!' cried Aziz as the train left the station.  Fielding and Godbole ran into the station, but they were too late - the train was going. 'I'm sorry!' cried Fielding. 'Godbole's prayers took longer than I thought!'  'This is a disaster!' cried Aziz.    Mrs Moore tried to comfort him. 'Dr Aziz, don't worry. Now we will all be Moslems together, as you said.'    Mrs Moore and Miss Quested did not enjoy the train ride to the Marabar Hills. The landscape was flat and dull The sunrise was disappointing. When they arrived at the Marabar train station, an elephant was there to take them to the hills. Aziz had spent a lot of money on the elephant. The ladies smiled politely when they saw it.  A crowd of local villagers met them at the station and followed them to the hills. Half way up the first hill, servants set up camp and prepared tea. Close by was the first of the Marabar Caves.  Mrs Moore, Miss Quested and Aziz drank tea and talked about the Moghul Emperors. Aziz felt happy now, even though Fielding was not there. The English ladies were his guests. His honor depended upon making them happy.  After breakfast they went into the first cave, followed by all the villagers. Humanity disappeared into the black hole in the hill. All was silent for five minutes, then humanity came out of the hole again with its noise and colour and life.  In Mrs Moore's opinion, the cave had been horrible - it was dark, hot, crowded and smelly. Mrs Moore had nearly fainted. A soft, naked thing had touched her face. She had hit her head and begun to panic. And there was a terrifying echo.  Professor Godbole had never mentioned an echo. The echo at the Marabar is unlike other echoes in India. Whatever is said, the same monotonous noise replies: 'ou-boum'. Hope, politeness, the blowing of a nose, all produce 'boum'. Each noise produces its own echo and echoes generate more echoes, so that soon the cave is full of sounds, like worms, moving round and round in tiny circles.  Mrs Moore was the first to leave the cave. The others all followed her out. Aziz and Adela came out smiling. Mrs Moore did not want to disappoint Aziz, so she smiled too. As the villagers came out, Mrs Moore looked at them, trying to identify the villain who had touched her face. She realised that she had been among the gentlest people, whose only desire was to honor her. The soft naked thing had been the hand of a baby held in his mother's arms. There had been nothing evil in the cave. But Mrs Moore had not enjoyed herself. She decided not to visit another cave.  Did you see the reflection of his match?' asked Adela. 'It was rather pretty. But Dr Aziz says that the best caves are higher up.'  'I don't want to go up there. I dislike climbing,' said Mrs Moore. 'But you should go.'  Aziz joined them, and Adela explained the change of plan. 'Dear Mrs Moore,' said Aziz. 'I am glad you are not coming which sounds strange, but you are treating me with true frankness, as a friend.'  'Yes, I am your friend,' said Mrs Moore, thinking how charming and good he was and how much she desired his happiness. 'May I make a suggestion? Don't let so many people come into the cave with you this time.'    'You are right!' cried Aziz and, going to the other extreme, he announced that no one could accompany them into the second cave except the guide. Mrs Moore watched as they climbed the hill towards the next group of caves. She took out her writing pad and wrote, 'Dear Stella and Ralph,' but then she stopped. She looked at the entrance to the cave she had visited. The more she thought of it, the more frightening it seemed. She could forget the smell and the heat, but the echo was unforgettable and terrifying. It seemed to say, 'Pathos, piety, courage - they exist but they are identical, and so is dirt. Everything exists but nothing has value.' The echo reduced all sounds to the same dull 'bou-oum'.    Adela, Aziz, and the guide climbed up the hill. The sun was getting hotter. Aziz had never liked Miss Quested as much as Mrs Moore. He had little to say to her and they walked in silence.  Adela was thinking about her marriage. She wanted to avoid becoming unpleasant to Indians like the other Englishwomen in Chandrapore. 'If I trust to common sense and goodwill,' she thought, 'my marriage will be happy and profitable.' But then she thought, 'What about love?' She and Ronny - no - they did not love each other.  'Am I walking too fast?' asked Aziz, for she had stopped with a doubtful expression on her face.  She was disturbed at this new realization that she did not love Ronny. Why had she never asked herself that question before? Should she break off her engagement? No. It was too late now. And perhaps love was not necessary to a successful marriage. 'No. I'm all right, thanks,' she replied. Aziz took her arm, and they continued climbing behind the guide.  'Are you married, Dr Aziz?' she asked.  'Yes.'  What a handsome little Oriental he was. No doubt his wife was beautiful too. She regretted that neither she nor Ronny had physical charm.  'How many wives do you have?' she asked, because Mrs Turton had told her that Moslems had several wives.  The question shocked the young man very much - it was offensive.    'One,' he said and let go of her arm. A few steps ahead of them were the entrances to several caves. Aziz ran into one of them to recover his equilibrium. Adela had no idea that she had said the wrong thing. Still thinking about her marriage, she too entered a cave.    Aziz waited in the cave for a minute, then went out again. He heard the sound of a car. Looking down at the plain, he saw a car approaching the hills. The guide was alone. 'Where is Miss Quested?' asked Aziz. The guide said that she had gone into a cave. 'Which cave?' The guide did not know. They shouted her name aloud for some time, but there was no reply. Aziz went into several caves but did not find her. 'This is the end of my career!' he thought in despair. 'My guest is lost!' He shouted at the guide who ran away. Left alone on the hill, Aziz suddenly saw her down on the plain, talking to another lady. He was so relieved that he was not surprised at her behavior. Turning to walk back down the hill, he saw her binoculars lying at the entrance of a cave. He picked them up and put them in his pocket.  When he got back to the camp, he found to his great joy that Fielding was there. 'Fielding! I'm so glad you have come!' he cried.  His friend ran to meet him, shouting explanations and apologies. Fielding had come in the car that Aziz had seen from the top of the hill. Miss Derek had brought him. Aziz sent a crowd of people to escort Miss Derek up from her car on the plain.  'Mr Fielding,' said Mrs Moore. 'Have you seen Miss Quested?'  'No. Aziz, where is Miss Quested?'  'Oh, she went down to see Miss Derek. Let's all have a drink.'  The crowd of people returned from the car with the driver. He said that Miss Derek and Miss Quested had gone back to Chandrapore.  'Oh, yes. I knew they had gone for a drive,' said Aziz. He was disappointed, but guests must be free to do as they wish, or they become prisoners.  'What's happened?' asked Fielding. He felt that something had gone wrong.  'Miss Derek is always in a hurry,' said Mrs Moore.  'She wasn't in a hurry when I left her,' Fielding replied. 'Perhaps Miss Quested was in a hurry.'  'Adela is never in a hurry!' said Mrs Moore.  Aziz said, 'We were talking to the guide when we saw the car, so she decided to go down to her friend.' He was inaccurate because he was sensitive. He did not want to remember Miss Quested's offensive question. 'She ran to her friend, and I ran to mine,' he said, smiling. 'And now I am with both my friends.'  Aziz loved Fielding and Mrs Moore, and so he expected them to love each other. But they did not want to love each other. Fielding thought, 'These women are the cause of the trouble.' Mrs Moore thought, 'This man, having missed the train, tries to blame us.' Since her experience in the cave, she had been feeling cynical and apathetic.  As they left the camp and returned on the elephant to the station Fielding asked Aziz, 'Where did you last see Miss Quested?'  Aziz pointed to the top of the steep hill.  'How did she get down? Did the guide help her?'  'Oh, yes. He was most helpful.'  'Is there a path down from the top of the hill?'  'Yes.'  Fielding could see nothing but a gully that ran straight down the steepest part of the hill. It was full of cactuses.  Mrs Moore fell asleep as they rode along. Mohammed Latif held her in his arms with efficiency and respect, to prevent her from falling off the elephant. Aziz felt happy. He had done his best to give his guests a good time. If they came late or left early, it was not important.  They got onto the train and moved slowly across the plain to Chandrapore. As soon as the train stopped in Chandrapore station, the door of their carriage was opened. There stood Mr Haq, the inspector of police. 'Dr Aziz,' he said, 'you are under arrest.'  'There must be some mistake,' said Fielding. 'What is the accusation?'  'I am not permitted to say. You must ask Mr McBryde.'  'We will. Come on, Aziz. Don't worry,' said Fielding. Aziz tried to escape out of the door on the other side of the carriage  Fielding held Aziz's arm. 'Dear fellow, we will go to McBryde together and ask what is wrong.'  'My children and my name!' cried Aziz.  They came out into the midday heat, arm in arm. Then Mr Turton called. 'Fielding, I must talk to you at once.' Fielding went to the Collector, and Aziz went off to prison alone.      CHAPTER FIVE    The Collector had watched the arrest from the waiting room When Fielding entered, he noticed that the Collector's face was white, fanatical, and rather beautiful. 'The worst thing in my whole career has happened.' he said at last. 'Miss Quested has been attacked in the Marabar Caves.'  'Oh no.' said Fielding, feeling sick.  'She escaped - by God's grace.'  'Oh no - not Aziz. It's absolutely impossible. Who accuses him?' asked Fielding.  'The victim herself,' said Mr Turton.  'Then she is mad,' said Fielding.  The Collector trembled with fury. 'Take back that last remark immediately!' he cried.  'I'm sorry, sir. I take back the remark,' said Fielding, for clearly the Collector was mad himself. 'I just cannot believe that Dr Aziz is guilty. Miss Quested must have made some mistake.'  'I have had twenty-five years' experience in this country,' said Mr Turton, 'and I have never known anything but disaster to result when English people and Indians try to be intimate socially. Newcomers ignore our traditions, and this is the result The good name of my district will be ruined for a generation! To think that an English girl fresh from England-'  It is impossible to regard a tragedy from two points of view. Turton had decided to avenge the girl. Fielding hoped to save the man.  'Where is Miss Quested now?' asked Fielding.  'She is ill.'  'How awful!'  The Collector looked at him with disapproval. Fielding was still interested in the facts. All over Chandrapore that day, the Europeans were abandoning their normal differences and becoming simply members of their community. They were filled with pity, anger and heroism, but they were incapable of logical thought.    Fielding said goodbye to the Collector and went to find McBryde, the Superintendent of Police.    McBryde was a thoughtful, educated man. He spoke to Aziz with courtesy and respect. He was shocked by the accusation against Aziz but not really surprised, because he had a theory about climatic zones. His theory was as follows: 'All unfortunate natives are criminals at heart because they live south of latitude 30.' Born in India, he seemed to contradict his own theory, and he sometimes admitted this with a sad smile.  'What is the accusation?' asked Fielding.    'That he followed her into the cave and made insulting advances. She hit him with her binoculars. He pulled her binoculars and the strap broke. She escaped. When we searched him, we found the binoculars in his pocket.'    'Did she say anything else?'  'There was an echo in the cave. It frightened her.'  'Did it make her nervous?'  'I couldn't ask her many questions. She was in a terrible state. Miss Derek said that when you'd gone to the camp, she saw Miss Quested running down the gully.'  'Was the guide with her?'  'No. She ran into the cactuses and got covered with cactus spines. Miss Derek helped her out of the cactuses, then took her to the car. When Miss Quested saw the Indian driver, she cried 'Don't let him come near me!' Miss Derek drove her back to Chandrapore and straight to my bungalow. They are there now.'  'I wish I could talk to Miss Quested,' said Fielding. 'I think she has made a mistake. I am sure that Aziz is innocent.'  'Really?' said McBryde in surprise. 'You are a schoolmaster, so you see them at their best, when they are boys. I see them when they are men. I know them as they really are. Look at this, for example.' He held up Aziz's wallet. 'There are some letters in here to a friend of his. He was arranging to see prostitutes in Calcutta.'  'Didn't you do the same when you were a young man? I did. Please let me see Miss Quested. I just want to ask her if she is sure that it was Aziz who followed her into the cave.'  'She is very ill. You have to ask Dr Callendar's permission to see her.'  They called Dr Callendar and received the expected reply: 'no.' 'Can I see Aziz?' asked Fielding.  'You have to ask permission first and I'm sure you don't want to disturb poor Heaslop at the moment.'  A policeman brought in the desk drawer from Aziz's bungalow.  'Photographs of women!'  'That's his wife,' said Fielding.  As Fielding left McBryde's office, he met Hamidullah. 'It's all a mistake!' said Fielding, holding his hand.  'We should have a Hindu lawyer to defend Aziz, so that we get the support of all Indians, not just Moslems,' said Hamidullah. 'I think we should have Amritrao from Calcutta.'  'Amritrao is a fine lawyer,' said Fielding, 'but he is anti-British. They hate him at the Club. They will consider it a political challenge if you hire him.'  'I don't care,' said Hamidullah. 'When I saw that dirty policeman carrying my friend's personal possessions into the office, I thought, 'Amritrao is the man we want.''  'Goodbye, then, my dear Hamidullah - we must drop the 'Mr' now. Give Aziz my love, and tell him to keep calm.'  'Goodbye, my dear Fielding. Are you really on our side against your own people?'    'Yes. Definitely.'  Fielding went back to his office at Government College to write a letter to Miss Quested. Professor Godbole came in and asked him questions about work. At the end of the conversation, the old man said, 'I am glad to hear that you got to the Marabar Caves. I hope the expedition was a successful one.'    'Ah! You have not heard the news! Dr Aziz has been arrested!' said Fielding.  'Oh, yes. I have heard.'  'Well, an expedition where that occurs cannot be called successful!'  'I don't know; I wasn't there.'  Fielding stared at him, but it was useless. No eye could see to the bottom of the Brahman's mind. Yet he had a mind and a heart too and all his friends trusted him, without knowing why. 'I am very upset about it,' said Fielding.  'Yes, I can see that. I have just one more question.'  'Well, what is it?' asked Fielding wearily.  'You know I will soon be leaving Government College. I will be returning to Mau - my birthplace in Central India - to take care of education there. I want to start a high school that will be like Government College. The point on which I desire your help is this: what name should be given to the school?'  'A name? For the school?' asked Fielding. He lay his head on his arms. Sometimes Indians were unbearable. 'I can think of nothing but poor Aziz. Do you realise that he is in prison?'  'Oh yes. I don't expect you to answer my question now. I had thought it might be called the 'Mr Fielding High School' or perhaps the 'King-Emperor George the Fifth'.'  'Godbole!'  The old fellow put his hands together and looked charming.  'Is Aziz innocent or guilty? What is your opinion? Did he do it?'  'That is a difficult question for a Hindu to answer.'  'Don't tell me it's because good and evil are the same.'    'No. Not exactly. In our philosophy, no one performs an action in isolation All perform a good action, when one is performed, and when an evil action is performed, all perform it. I am informed that an evil action was performed in the Marabar Hills, and that a respected English lady is now seriously ill in consequence. My answer to the question is this - that action was performed by Dr Aziz.' He stopped for a moment. 'It was performed by the guide.' He stopped again. 'It was performed by you. It was performed by me. It was even performed by the lady herself. When evil occurs, it expresses the whole universe. Similarly when good occurs. Good and evil are different, as their names imply. But they are both aspects of my Lord. He is present in one and absent in the other. The difference between presence and absence is great. Yet absence implies presence. Absence is not non-existence. Therefore we are entitled to repeat, 'Come, come, come, come'.' Then, as if to cancel out any beauty his words might have contained, he added. 'But did you have time to visit any of the interesting Marabar antiquities?'      CHAPTER SIX    Although Adela had not made herself popular with the English, she brought out all that was fine in their characters. 'What can we do for our sister?' thought Mrs Callendar and Mrs Lesley, as they drove through the afternoon heat to enquire. Even Mrs Turton cared for her with affection. People drove to the Club and had drinks together as usual, but everything had changed. As they looked out at the strange landscape, they realised that they were thousands of miles from home. The Club was fuller than usual, and several parents had brought their children.    The Collector clapped his hands for silence. 'I want to talk especially to the ladies,' he said when he had the attention of all present. 'There is no cause for alarm. Don't go into the city. Don't talk in front of your servants. Everything is absolutely normal in the city. The drums you hear are just the preparations for Mohurram, which will take place next week.'  'Mr McBryde has gone down to the city disguised as a Holy Man,' said Mrs Callendar.  'That's exactly the sort of thing that must not be said Be more careful. Mrs Callendar.'  She was not offended - his severity made her feel safe.  'Where is the - where is he?' asked Mrs Lesley.    'He is in prison. Will the ladies leave the room now. please? And remember what I have said. You must help us through this difficult time. Can I depend on you?'  'Yes, indeed, oh yes,' the women replied in chorus.    When the men were alone the Collector said, 'We must keep calm. One isolated Indian has attempted - is accused of an attempted crime. Until we know more, you must assume that every Indian is an angel.'  'Right... We will... Angels... Exactly,' said the men.  Just then the door opened and Dr Callendar came in. 'Miss Quested is a little better,' he said, 'but she still has a fever.'  'How is the old lady?' asked Mr Lesley.  'She has a fever too. Heaslop's on his way here.'  At the name of Heaslop a fine and beautiful expression appeared on every face. Miss Quested was only a victim, but Heaslop was a martyr. Heaslop - like all Englishmen in India - worked hard for the good of the Indian people, and this is how they repaid him!  'I wish I had never given my assistant the day off,' said Dr Callendar. 'Did you hear about Miss Quested's servant? Heaslop told the servant to stay with the ladies, but the prisoner bribed him to stay behind. And what about Mr Fielding? Why didn't he go on the expedition as planned? Money again.'  Fielding rose to his feet.  'I don't mean that they bribed you, Mr Fielding. They paid the other Indian to make you late. Godbole.'  'That's ridiculous,' said Fielding sitting down again.  Dr Callendar continued, 'And Aziz paid a crowd of natives to smother Mrs Moore in a cave. Then he went on alone with the girl. There was a guide too, but now he can't be found. It was all very well planned.' He raised his voice and cried, 'It's time to call in the army! It's time for action!'  Everyone ignored him, but he had disturbed them deeply. The crime was even worse than they had imagined. Fielding became thoughtful. The evil was propagating in every direction. It seemed to have an existence of its own.  The door opened and Ronny came in He looked exhausted, tragic and gentler than usual. The men, out of respect for him, all rose to their feet. Fielding realized that while honoring Heaslop they were condemning Aziz and India. He remained seated.  'I only came in to hear what has been decided,' said Ronny. 'Please, will everyone sit down?'  'Some never stood up,' said Ur Callendar, then he turned to Fielding and cried, 'Stand up, you swine!'  'May I make a statement, sir?' said Fielding to the Collector.  'Certainly.'  'I believe Dr Aziz is innocent,' said Fielding calmly. 'If he is found guilty by the court. I will resign from my post and leave India.'    Fielding turned to leave. 'One moment!' said the Collector 'Before you leave, you will express some detestation of the crime, and you will apologise to Mr Heaslop for not standing when he entered the room.' Dr Callendar stood in front of the door, blocking Fielding's path.    'Let him go,' said Ronny, almost in tears.    Out of respect for Heaslop, they let Fielding go. Fielding felt relieved that he had made his position clear. He left the Club and went to join his allies - the Nawab Bahadur, Hamidullah, Mahmoud Ali and others - in the city.      CHAPTER SEVEN    Adela lay for several days in the McBrydes' bungalow.    Miss Derek and Mrs McBryde spent hours looking at her skin, picking out hundreds of cactus spines. Everyone was kind to her - too kind. But the only person she wanted to see - Mrs Moore - did not come to visit her.  Her mood changed frequently. One moment she was cool and sensible, trying to explain what happened in the cave, then she burst into hysterical tears. She wanted to see Mrs Moore and ask her about the echo, which she kept hearing even now. Only Mrs Moore could stop the echo.  When the cactus spines had all been removed and her fever had gone down, Ronny came to take her home. He and McBryde told her about events that had taken place during her illness.  McBryde said, 'I'm sorry, Miss Quested, but you'll have to testify in court.'  Ronny said, 'Das - my Indian subordinate - will preside at the trial.'  They told her about the troubles during Mohurram - on the last day of the festival, the procession had left its usual path and come up to the Civil Station as a protest against the imprisonment of Aziz. Fortunately, the police had been able to prevent further trouble. Finally, McBryde showed her a letter that had come for her while she was ill. It was from Fielding. It said that Aziz was innocent.  As they drove to his bungalow Ronny said, 'Mother is glad that you're coming home. But remember that she is old. Don't expect too much.'  When they got to the house, they found Mrs Moore sitting on the sofa. Her face was very red. She did not get up when they entered. Adela sat down beside her and said, 'I am so glad to see you again. You are the only one who can help me. Everyone else is a stranger.'  But Mrs Moore showed no desire to be helpful. All her Christian gentleness had gone. She seemed irritated with the human race in general.  'I keep hearing an echo,' said Adela. 'It won't go away.'  'I don't suppose it ever will,' said Mrs Moore.  'What is it? Please tell me.'  'If you don't know, I can't tell you.'  'I think you are rather unkind not to say.'  'Say?' said the old woman. 'As if anything can be said! I have spent my life saying things and hearing things said I have listened too much. I want to be left in peace.'  Ronny was irritated. He had told his mother to give Adela a pleasant welcome, but she was being horrible. 'The trial is starting soon,' he said impatiently. 'And most of us believe that we should help each other. Are you going to talk like that at the trial?'  'I will have nothing to do with your ridiculous trial,' said Mrs Moore.  'I don't want her to come to the trial if she does not want to,' said Adela 'Her testimony is not essential.'    'I shall attend your marriage but not your trial,' said Mrs Moore. 'Then I shall go to England. Why is there always so much to be done? Why do anything? Why all this marriage? Love in a church, love in a cave, what's the difference?'    Adela was crying, and Ronny noticed that an Indian was standing outside the window, listening to their conversation. 'I'm sorry, my dear girl,' said Ronny.  Adela stopped crying and looked up and said, 'Aziz, Aziz, have I made a mistake?'  'You're tired,' said Ronny.  'Ronny, he's innocent; your mother said so. I made an awful mistake.'  He looked through the window, but the Indian was gone. Adela touched her ear. 'My echo has stopped,' she said.  'My mother never mentioned his name,' said Ronny. 'You're confusing this with Fielding's letter.'  'Oh, yes! That must be it,' she cried.  'Mother, you didn't mention the prisoner's name just now, did you?'  'No.'  'I thought you said 'Aziz is an innocent man' just then, when you were talking about love,' said Adela.  'Of course he is innocent,' answered the old lady: It was the first time she had expressed an opinion on the subject.  'Do you have any evidence in the prisoner's favour?' asked Ronny.  'I know people's characters. I have heard both English and Indians speak well of him.'  'That isn't evidence. Mother!'    'This is terrible,' said Adela. 'I'm still certain that he followed me, but can't I stop the trial? Oh, of course, it's impossible. I'm sorry I mentioned it. Please forgive me.'    'Of course I forgive you,' said Ronny. 'But the case has to come to trial now. The machinery has started.'  'She has started the machinery,' said Mrs Moore, 'and it will work to its end.'    Then Ronny had an excellent idea - his mother should leave India at once.    So, at her son's suggestion and by her own desire, Mrs Moore departed by ship from Bombay. When she was gone, the weather grew hotter. On the morning of the trial, Adela was very nervous. She went to the court with the Turtons. Children threw stones at the Collector's car.  They entered the courthouse and went to the waiting room, where other English people were waiting for them.  Dr Callendar was talking about the Nawab Bahadur's elegant grandson Nureddin. The previous day, the Civil Surgeon had treated Nureddin after an accident. 'When he saw his face in the mirror, he cried. I laughed! I thought, the women won't like you now! I wish I could cut up Aziz too. Nothing is too bad for these people!'  'I agree,' said Mrs Turton. 'You men have been too weak, too kind to these natives.'  Just then they were called to the courtroom. The trial was about to begin.  The courtroom was crowded and very hot. Mr Das asked Mr McBryde to make his opening speech for the prosecution. McBryde's speech was not emotional. He described the expedition to the Marabar Caves in detail. He said that the prisoner was immoral, and that he had letters to prove it. At that point he took off his glasses and looked at the audience. 'Science has proven,' he said, 'that the darker races are physically attracted to the fairer, but not vice versa.'  Then a voice out of nowhere cried, 'Even when the lady is so much uglier than the gentleman?'  'Throw that man out!' said Mr Das.  A policeman took hold of a man who had said nothing and threw him out of the courtroom.  While Mr McBryde continued his opening speech, Adela looked around the hall. She saw all the people she had met in her silly attempt to see India. The Nawab Bahadur, other people she had met at the Bridge Party, and the prisoner himself. Close to him sat Fielding with an Indian child on his knee. When she met his eyes, he looked away.  McBryde's speech went on and on. He was patient. He gave all the details. He explained that the crime had been planned. Fielding and the servant Antony had been the prisoner's dupes. He described the landscape in detail, especially the steep gully. Finally he produced the binoculars with the broken strap. 'I will now call my witnesses,' said McBryde, removing his glasses. 'The facts speak for themselves. The prisoner had led a double life, pretending to be a respectable member of society, but in fact he is absolutely evil. He behaved very cruelly to another of his guests - another English lady. He paid his servants to smother her in the first cave, so that he could go on to the other caves alone with Miss Quested.'  Mahmoud Ali leapt to his feet and cried, 'Is my client accused of murder as well? Who is this other lady?'  'I won't call her as a witness,' said McBryde.  'No!' cried Mahmoud Ali hysterically. 'You won't because you can't! You've sent her out of the country! She is Mrs Moore, and she believed that my client was innocent!'  'Why didn't you call her as a witness yourself?' asked Mr Das.  'I did not know until it was too late! That's British justice! Give us Mrs Moore for five minutes only, and she will save my friend!'  'My mother's ship is probably in Egypt by now,' said Ronny.  Mahmoud Ali was nearly mad with fury. 'You sent her away because she knew the truth! I ruin my career, but it is not important. We will all be ruined one by one!'  'This is no way to defend your case!' said Mr Das.  'I am not defending one, and you are not trying one. We are both slaves!'  'Mr Mahmoud Ali, unless you sit down, I will have to ask you to leave the court.'  'Do so! This trial is a farce! I am going!' He handed his papers to Amritrao and left. The noise in the courtroom grew louder. Many people were talking at once in excited voices, and the name 'Mrs Moore' could be heard again and again. People who did not know what the syllables of her name meant repeated them like a charm. The syllables sounded Indian now - Esmiss Esmoor. They were chanted in the courtroom and in the street outside.  Poor Mr Das tried to restore order to the court, but everyone ignored him.  'They had Mahmoud Ali just to make a scene if he got the chance. It is his speciality,' said Ronny, but the scene disturbed him deeply. It was revolting to hear his mother turned into Esmiss Esmoor, a Hindu goddess.  Suddenly the chanting stopped. Much to everyone's surprise, Mr Amritrao said, 'I apologise for my colleague.'  It was now time for Adela to give her evidence. Mr McBryde asked her questions, and she retold the story of that day. As she retold it, she relived it. And now it had a beauty it had not possessed at the time. Why had she thought the expedition dull? Now, in her mind, the sun rose again, the elephant waited, she entered the first cave and saw the reflection of the match's flame in the smooth walls. All of if now seemed beautiful and significant. McBryde asked her questions and she gave precise answers.  'When the prisoner and the guide took you to the other caves, was anyone else present?'  'No.' Adela remembered the rocks and the sun on her back.  'You walked up the hill to the next group of caves. Did you then go alone into one of those caves?'  'Yes.' She remembered the entrance of the cave and the darkness within.  'And the prisoner followed you into the cave?'  'Now we've got him!' said Dr Callendar.  Adela was silent. The court was waiting for her to answer, but she could not reply until she saw Aziz enter the cave in her mind's eye.  'The prisoner followed you, didn't he?' asked McBryde.  She waited, watching the entrance of the cave in her mind's eye, waiting for Aziz to come in, but he did not come. 'I am not quite sure,' she said at last.  'Excuse me?' asked McBryde, looking frightened. 'I didn't hear your answer.'  'I cannot be sure...'  'You entered the cave, then the prisoner followed you. Is that not right?'  'No,' she said. No one yet understood what was happening except Fielding, He saw that his friend was saved.  'What are you saying? Speak up, please,' said Mr Das.  'I'm afraid I have made a mistake.'  'What kind of mistake?'  'Dr Aziz never followed me into the cave.'  McBryde said, 'Miss Quested, let us continue. I will read you the words of the statement you signed in my bungalow two hours later.'  'Excuse me, Mr McBryde,' said Mr Das, 'but you can't continue. I am speaking to the witness myself. Miss Quested, please repeat what you just said clearly.'  'Dr Aziz never-'  Mr Turton whispered something to Dr Callendar, who then called out, 'I stop this trial for medical reasons.' The English all stood up and the little Indian Magistrate was hidden behind their large white forms. The Indians rose too and the courtroom was full of voices. But Mr Das was still speaking to Miss Quested 'Do you withdraw the charge?' he cried.  'Yes,' said Adela clearly.    'The prisoner is released!' announced Mr Das, exhausted by the stress of the trial. People screamed, kissed one another, wept passionately. Aziz fainted in Hamidullah's arms.      CHAPTER EIGHT    Adela walked through the crowd of shouting Indians to the door of the courthouse and out into the street. Miss Quested, where are you going?' cried Fielding when he saw her.    'I don't know.'  'You can't walk around alone. Why don't you stay with your own people? Perhaps there will be trouble, and you will not be safe. Come this way. I'll put you in my carriage.'  'Cyril, Cyril, don't leave me!' cried Aziz.  'I'm coming back,' Fielding replied as he led Miss Quested to his carriage. She got into it obediently. Expecting the trial to last a long time, the driver had gone to visit a friend and had taken the horses with him. Fielding could not leave Adela alone in the carriage. The crowd was very excited. Two of Fielding's students came up and put a garland of flowers around his neck. 'Sir, we will be your horses. We will pull the carriage,' one said, pushing Fielding into the carriage next to Adela.  'Well, at least you are safe here,' said Fielding as the students pulled the carriage through the crowd. People spoke to them and put garlands around their necks. Some of them called Adela 'Mrs Moore'. Finally, they reached the peace and quiet of Government College and the exquisite blue arches of the garden-house.  Fielding tried to call McBryde, but the telephone lines had been cut. He could not leave Adela and go to celebrate with Aziz.  At that moment Aziz was crying, 'Cyril, Cyril...' He was riding in a carriage with the Nawab Bahadur, Hamidullah, Mahmoud Ali, and lots of flowers. Victory gave him no pleasure - he had suffered too much. He just wanted to be with his friends. 'Where is Cyril? Let's turn back.' But the carriage could not turn back. It was part of a procession that advanced down the street.  Mahmoud Ali was shouting insults against the Civil Surgeon and the Superintendent of Police.  'Mr Mahmoud Ali, this is not wise.' said the Nawab. He had great possessions and disliked anarchy.  'Cyril has deserted me again,' said Aziz.  'Down with the Civil Surgeon! Rescue Nureddin!'  'Nureddin?'  'They are torturing him.'  'Oh, my God!' cried Aziz, for Nureddin was his friend too.  'They are not,' said the Nawab. 'I will not let you use my grandson as an excuse to attack the hospital.'  'I heard Callendar say it. I was outside the window and he said, 'I have tortured that nigger.' They hope to destroy us one by one. But they shall fail.'  Mahmoud Ali's words were repeated and soon the procession moved towards the hospital. The earth and sky were ugly. Evil was everywhere. 'Let's rescue Nureddin!' they cried. 'Then we will have our revenge!'  But disaster was averted. At the hospital Nureddin was released at once and the Nawab persuaded his friends to go home. 'No violence, please!' he cried. 'Aziz is free and Nureddin is safe.    Let's just go home and celebrate our victory. I will no longer use the title the British gave me. From now on, I am just Mr Zulfiquar and you are all invited to Dilkusha, my country house, for a party.'    That evening, Fielding and Miss Quested had the first of their strange conversations about the Marabar Caves. They were at Government College. No one had come to take her back to the Civil Station during the afternoon.  'Do you want to hear my side of the story?' asked Miss Quested.  'Not really. I'm on the other side,' Fielding replied.  'You can repeat anything I say to your friends. I have no more secrets. You see, I have been ill ever since that expedition to the caves and possibly before it.'  Fielding was interested. 'What kind of illness?' he asked.  She touched the side of her head.  'I thought so. The day of the arrest I thought that perhaps you had had a hallucination. One of four things happened in the Marabar Caves. Either Aziz is guilty, or you invented the charge out of malice, or you had a hallucination. I believe that you yourself broke the strap of your binoculars. You were alone in that cave the whole time.'  'Perhaps...'  'When did you first start feeling ill?'  'When I came to tea with you here.'  'That was an unfortunate party. Both Aziz and Godbole were ill after it too.'  'I enjoyed the singing... but then a sort of depression began, although I didn't notice it at the time. And it continued until today. So you think I had a hallucination, the sort of thing that makes some women think they have received an offer of marriage when none was made?'  'Yes,' said Fielding. 'You are very honest about it.'  'I was brought up to be honest. The trouble is, honesty doesn't help.'  He began to like her more.  'I think your illness ended in court this morning. McBryde exorcised you. He asked you a simple question, and you answered it.'  'When you said 'exorcised' I thought you meant that I had seen a ghost.'  'Of course not!'  'Some people whom I respect very much believe in ghosts,' she said. 'Mrs Moore does.'  'There is a fourth possibility of what happened in the caves,' said Fielding. 'Perhaps it was the guide or someone else.'  'Perhaps,' she said quietly. She had lost interest in the question.  At that moment, Hamidullah came in. He was not pleased to see them together. Like most people in Chandrapore, he could not understand Miss Quested's behaviour.  Fielding thought he should try to make the meeting friendly. 'Miss Quested has been explaining why she acted as she did this morning.'  'The fact is,' said Adela nervously, 'that I realised before it was too late that I had made a mistake and I said so. That's all.'  'That's all?' cried Hamidullah. 'I am very glad you acted as you did, and I was pleased when our students gave you garlands. But I was surprised No - surprise is too weak a word. You damage my best friend in ways you cannot possibly understand, because of your ignorance of our society and religion. Then at the trial you say, 'Oh, I made a mistake.' Am I mad? I keep asking myself. Is this a dream? And it seems that the dream is not yet finished. As I came in I heard your conversation. Now, it seems, you accuse the poor guide!'  'No,' said Fielding. 'We were just discussing possibilities.'  'There are many Indians in this country Of course one or other of them entered the cave! And since, dear Fielding, it will take a long time to discover which Indian is to blame, I suggest you come with me to Dilkusha.'  'Yes, certainly. Miss Quested, you stay here at Government College until you decide where you want to go. I will be away for two days.'  'No need for that,' said Hamidullah, looking out of the window. 'Here comes the City Magistrate.'  'At last,' said Adela.  'He comes, he comes, he comes.' sang Hamidullah.  'Will you ask him what he wants, Mr Fielding?'  'He has some news for you,' he said on his return. 'He is on the veranda. He prefers not to come in.'  Adela went out to talk to Ronny.  Fielding said to Hamidullah, Poor Heaslop. He has just received news that his mother died at sea. She was already dead this morning when they were chanting her name in the courtroom.'  'Really? I am sorry. I suppose it was the heat. This is no time for an old lady to travel.'  'Yes. Heaslop should never have let her go, and he knows it.'  'This is his punishment for sending our witness away before she could help us.'    'She couldn't have saved Aziz,' said Fielding. 'Only Miss Quested could have saved him.'    Miss Quested decided to stay at Government College. Fielding and Hamidullah drove out to Dilkusha with Amritrao. They decided not to tell Aziz about Mrs Moore's death until the next day. They did not want to ruin his victory party. On the way, Hamidullah asked Amritrao how much Miss Quested ought to pay Aziz in compensation.  'Twenty thousand rupees.'  Fielding was horrified.  Later that night, after the victory dinner, Aziz and all his friends lay asleep or looking at the stars on the roof of Dilkusha.  'Aziz, are you awake?'  'No. So let's dream of the future. We must spend all our vacations together. I want to take you to Persia. You shall be my guest, because I will have lots of compensation money.'  'You have won a great victory,' began Fielding.  'I know what you are going to say. You want me to excuse Miss Quested from paying compensation, so that the English will say, 'This native has behaved like a gentleman.' I am no longer interested in the approval of the English. I have become anti-British. The English have been the cause of all my troubles.'  'I am English.'    Aziz clearly did not want to talk about the English and Miss Quested any more, but Fielding insisted. 'You must excuse her from paying compensation. She must pay your costs, of course, but don't treat her like a conquered enemy.'    'Cyril, you are a nice man and my best friend, but in many ways you are a fool. You think the English will have more respect for me - and Indians in general - if I am kind to Miss Quested. You are wrong. They will see it as weakness. Anyway, I am going to leave British India. I will go to an Indian State, where the English cannot insult me.'    'I had a long talk with Miss Quested and I am beginning to understand her character. She is really very brave. In the courtroom, she realised she had made a mistake and she admitted it. I don't think I have that kind of courage. All her friends - all British India - wanted her to say that you followed her into the cave, but she said 'No'. Be merciful, Aziz, like one of your six Moghul Emperors.'    'Not even the Moghul Emperors showed mercy until they received an apology.'  'She'll apologise,' said Fielding. 'You dictate to me whatever form of words you like, and she will sign it tomorrow.'  There was a silence, then Aziz's voice came out of the darkness. 'Cyril, I have an idea. I will ask Mrs Moore what I should do.'  Fielding opened his eyes and saw thousands of stars. He could not reply - they silenced him.  'If she tells me to pardon this girl, I will.'  'Let's discuss it tomorrow.'  'I keep forgetting that she has left India. This morning, when they were chanting her name, I imagined that she was present.'  'I'm sorry to tell you this, Aziz, but Mrs Moore is dead.' Hamidullah, who was lying close by them in the darkness, said, 'Don't believe him, Aziz. He is only joking.'  'I don't believe him,' said Aziz.    Fielding looked up at the stars and thought that people are not really dead until the people who love them know they are dead.  The consequences of the incident in the Marabar Caves were many. Adela stayed on at Government College for a few weeks, but finally Ronny broke off his engagement to her and she returned to England. By the time she left, she and Fielding had become friends, and Fielding had persuaded Aziz to excuse her from paying compensation.    The English continued to believe that Aziz was guilty. Years later, they still talked about it as a 'bad case' in which the girl had been too frightened to give her evidence.  The cult of Esmiss Esmoor continued to grow in Chandrapore. People told a story about an Englishman who had killed his mother to stop her from saving an Indian's life. Little shrines and tombs appeared and offerings were made to Esmiss Esmoor. Although Aziz was a Moslem, the cult of Esmiss Esmoor was a Hindu cult. Hindus and Moslems - always divided in the past - were united by the trial, and Aziz became a hero in the Indian community in general.  And a rumour began to circulate among Indians at Chandrapore. They said that while Miss Quested was staying in Government College, she and Fielding had been lovers. When Aziz heard it, he pretended to be amused, but he was deeply hurt. He felt that Fielding had betrayed their friendship by being intimate with his enemy. He also resented the fact that Fielding had not told him. He himself had told Fielding many secrets, but the Englishman had told him nothing in return.    Fielding and Aziz spent a great deal of time together, but their friendship was disturbed by misunderstandings. When Fielding went to England for a short time, Aziz felt that his suspicions were confirmed. Fielding had saved the girl a fine of twenty thousand rupees, and now he followed her to England.      CHAPTER NINE    Hundreds of kilometers west of the Marabar Hills, and two years later in time, Professor Godbole stands in the presence of God. God is not born yet - that will happen at midnight - but He was also born centuries ago, and He can never be born, because He is Lord of the Universe, who transcends human processes. He is, was not, is not, was.    Professor Godbole stood at one end of a long carpet. The God was at the other end - represented by a small silver image. Hindus sat on either side of the carpet, chanting.    The beautiful white palace at Mau was decorated for the holiday with many brightly coloured cloths and ornaments. The air was full of chanting voices, the ringing of little bells and the beating of drums. The poets of the state had written inscriptions for this holiday. Some hung in dark corners where no one could read them. One was written in English to indicate the universality of God. Unfortunately, the writer had made a mistake and the sign read, 'God si Love.'    Professor Godbole danced, wearing a blue turban. As he danced, he remembered an old woman he had met in Chandrapore. He concentrated his mind upon the old woman, calling her forward to the place where completeness can be found. The hour of the God's birth was near. The ruler of the state was brought in to watch it. He was old and ill. No one greeted the Rajah - this was not a moment for human glory. He sat on the carpet close to the altar and leaned against a pillar.    The clock struck midnight. The air was full of incense and the sound of bells. The God was born. All sorrow was annihilated, not only for Indians but for foreigners, birds, caves, railways and the stars. There was joy and laughter. Tears ran down the Rajah's tired old face. His attendants took him to his rooms, where Dr Aziz was waiting to give him a sedative.    Dr Aziz left the palace at the same time. As he returned to his house, he saw Professor Godbole ahead of him, hurrying through the rain.  'Hello!' called Aziz.  Godbole kept running but called back, 'He is at the European Guest House.'  Aziz smiled as his old friend ran on. He had come to Mau through Godbole's influence, and it had been a successful move. The weather at Mau was mild, so Aziz's children could live with him permanently. He had married again, and Mohammed Latif had come to live with them. Aziz's work left him plenty of free time to read and write poetry. He was respected as one of the voices of the India of the future. His poems were all on one subject: Oriental women. 'The purdah must go.' they said, 'or we will never be free.'  He was glad to have left British India. The English had frightened him permanently. Here, the divisions were between the castes of Hinduism. The Moslems and the English were irrelevant. Because his friend Godbole was a Brahman, Aziz too was treated as a Brahman. He had lived quietly and contentedly at Mau for two years, but now something was disturbing him. Fielding had arrived.  His friendship with Fielding had cooled. Aziz's suspicions of Fielding began after the trial, when Fielding spent so much time with Miss Quested. Then Fielding had gone to England and, after a long silence, the expected letter came from London. 'I have some news that might surprise you. I am going to marry someone you know...' He did not read further. 'Here it comes. Answer it for me, Mahmoud Ali.' He destroyed all the letters Fielding wrote him after that without reading them. Now, standing in the rain, he said to himself, 'I am an Indian at last.'  When Aziz got home, he found a note from Fielding. The note said that Fielding hoped to stay in Mau for two days. He was making a tour of inspection of schools in the Indian States. His wife and her brother were with him. They would like to go out in a boat that evening to see the procession. Could Aziz arrange it?    They didn't want to give any trouble... Aziz threw away the note. He had shown Miss Quested India before, with disastrous results.  Later that day, Aziz went for a walk with his children. Jamila held his hand. Ahmed and Karim ran in front, looking for a frog to put in Mohammed Latif's bed. The scenery around them was beautiful, though the land was wet from the rains, and the sky was grey. They could see the river in the valley below, the palace of a local queen, and the European Guest House. They passed an old building, a shrine to a Moslem saint. It had no roof, and bees had built their nests inside it.  Two Englishmen entered the shrine but ran out again pursued by bees. They were Fielding and his brother-in-law. The children laughed. Aziz had not intended to talk to his former friend, but the accident put him in a good mood. 'Hello, gentlemen,' he called out. 'Are you in trouble?'    The brother-in-law cried out: the bees had stung him. Aziz went up to the stranger and pulled two stings out of his wrist.  'Hello, Aziz,' said Fielding, but his voice was not friendly. 'Is he all right?'  'Oh yes. I have an ointment that will stop the pain. I will send it to the Guest House.'  'Why didn't you answer my letters?' asked Fielding, but just then the rain became more intense. Fielding said, 'We will have to go back to the Guest House. Which is the quickest way back down to our carriage?'  'Down here.'  When they reached the carriage, Aziz opened the door and said, 'Come on, Mr Quested, Mr Fielding.'  'Who is Mr Quested?' asked Fielding.  'Do I mispronounce that well-known name? Is he not your wife's brother?'  'I'm Ralph Moore,' said the boy.  'Don't you know that my wife was Mrs Moore's daughter?' said Fielding. 'Perhaps this explains your strange attitude.'  'What attitude?' asked Aziz.    'That ridiculous letter you let Mahmoud Ali write for you. How did you make such a mistake?' asked Fielding in his old friendly voice. 'Miss Quested! What an extraordinary idea! She is our best friend and she introduced us, but why on earth did you think I had married her? Aziz, we must talk about this. If is all Mahmoud Ali's fault. He knows that I married Miss Moore. He called her 'Heaslop's sister' in his insolent letter to me.'    Hearing Ronny's name made Aziz furious. 'She is Heaslop's sister, and this is his brother, and you are his brother-in-law, so goodbye! Yes, yes, I made a mistake. I thought you had married my enemy. I never read your letters. Mahmoud Ali deceived me. I thought you had stolen my money but-' he clapped his hands together and his children came to him - 'I forgive Mahmoud Ali because he loved me. My heart is for my own people from now on!'  Cyril followed him apologizing, laughing, explaining. Speaking in Urdu so that his children could understand, Aziz said, 'Please do not follow us. I want no Englishman or Englishwoman to be my friend.'    He returned to his house excited and happy. It had been a strange moment when Mrs Moore's name was mentioned, bringing back old memories of 'Esmiss Esmoor'. Perhaps she was coming to help him again. And the young man was her son Ralph, and Stella was married to Cyril.      CHAPTER TEN    The sounds of chanting and music continued to come from the palace all day long. The festival continued, wild and sincere, and all men loved each other. Aziz had nothing to do all day, so just before sunset he took the ointment to the Guest House. As he rode up the hill, Aziz saw a boat on the lake below. The English had gone out to see the procession Aziz felt angry again. This English desire to 'see India' was only a way of ruling India.    When he reached the Guest House, he found the only servant asleep in the entryway. Aziz walked in and looked around. There were two letters on the piano in the living room. Aziz read them. He was not ashamed to do this. McBryde had read all his letters. One of the letters was from Heaslop to Fielding, the other was from Miss Quested to Stella.  'Oh, who is that?' said a nervous voice. Something moved in the darkness of the next room. Aziz could not remember where he had heard that voice before.  'The doctor,' he replied, putting the letters into his pocket. Ralph Moore came into the light. He was a strange boy, tall and old-looking with big blue eyes.  'How are your bee-stings?' asked Aziz, but his voice was not friendly.  'They hurt.'  'Come here, please, and let me look at them.'  They were alone. Aziz could treat the patient as Callendar had treated Nureddin.  When Aziz touched Ralph's wrist, the boy cried out, 'Oh, your hands are unkind!' Aziz looked at his hands. The extraordinary boy was right. Aziz replied angrily, 'That is a strange thing to say. I am a qualified doctor and I will not hurt you!'  'There is no pain, but there is cruelty,' replied Ralph.  The noise of the procession rose around them and the guns of the State went off. The Hindus were chanting the names of gods:    Radhakrishna, Radhakrishna,  Krishnaradha, Radhakrishna...    Aziz put the ointment on Ralph's bee-stings and said, 'I must go now. Goodnight.' Suddenly his anger left him and he shook Ralph's hand. 'You don't think me unkind anymore?'  'No.'  'How do you know?'  'I know if a stranger is my friend.'  'Then you are an Oriental.'  Those words! He had said them to Mrs Moore in the mosque at the beginning of the cycle from which, after so much suffering, he had got free. Never be friends with the English! Mosque, caves, mosque, caves. And here he was starting again He gave the ointment to Ralph. 'Keep it,' he said. 'I must give you one little present, and it is all I have. You are Mrs Moore's son.'  'I certainly am,' said Ralph.  'But you are also Heaslop's brother, and the two nations can't be friends.'  'I know. Not yet.  'Did your mother speak to you about me?'  'Yes. In her letters. She loved you.'  'Would you like me to take you out in a boat to see the procession?'  Aziz and Ralph went down to the water and got into one of the Guest House boats. The wind was rising and it blew the boat towards the procession. There was a flash of lightning, then another, and the rain poured down. The Hindus were singing and dancing, preparing to throw their God away into the water.    The little boat came closer to the palanquin, pushed forward by the wind, then suddenly English voices called out, 'Take care!' The two Guest House boats collided. The image of God, the letters of Ronny and Adela - all floated loose on the surface of the water. The sounds of guns, elephants, chanting and thunder filled the air, the scene was illuminated by a flash of lightning and the four outsiders were united in the water.    Friends again, yet aware that this was their last meeting, Aziz and Fielding went riding together in the jungle of Mau. After the boat accident, there had been no more nonsense. They had returned to their old friendship. Aziz had written a charming letter to Miss Quested, thanking her for saving him from prison. Finally he understood her courage. Now they rode between bushes and rocks, through fields bright with butterflies.  Fielding had changed. He no longer travelled light. Having married an Englishwoman, he had become more like the other Anglo-Indians and was acquiring some of their limitations. Already he felt surprise at his own past heroism - he had defied his own people for the sake of an Indian. He could never do that sort of thing again, because now he had the responsibility of a family.  As they rode along, they talked about politics, and they enjoyed their talk. Fielding said, 'The British Empire can't be abolished just because it's rude.'  'We don't want you!' cried Aziz, with abstract hate.  'Without us, India would be chaotic. You can't rule yourselves. You need the British.'  Aziz grew more excited and cried, 'Get out, all of you! Ten years ago, we wanted your help, but now it's too late! If I don't make you go, Ahmed and Karim will! Why do we have to suffer so much? We used to blame you, but now we are wiser and blame ourselves. We will keep silent until the next European war, but then our time will come! India shall be one nation! Hindu and Moslem shall be united! And then-' Aziz rode his horse close to Fielding's and kissed his cheek - 'and then you and I will be friends.'  'Why can't we be friends now?' said Fielding. 'It's what I want. It's what you want.'  But the horses didn't want it - they moved apart. The earth, the temples, the lake, the palace, the birds, the Guest House that suddenly came into view - they didn't want it. They said in their hundred voices, 'No, not yet', and the sky replied, 'No, not here.'      - THE END -  Hope you have enjoyed the reading!
