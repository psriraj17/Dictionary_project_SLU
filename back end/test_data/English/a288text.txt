LONDON:   JOHN RUSSELL SMITH,   SOHO SQUARE.   1876.     Al     POLY-OLBION.     THE NINTH SONG.  The Argibient.   The Muse here Merioneth vaunts.   And her proud Mountains hifjhli/ chaunts.   The mils and Brooks, to bravery bent,   Stand/or precedence from descent :   The Rivers for them shewing there   The wonders of their Pimblemere.   Proud Snowdon gloriously jiroceeds   With Cambria's native Princes' deeds.   The Muse then through Carnarvan makes,   And Mon (now Anglesey) awakes   To tell her ancient Druids' guise,   And manner of their sacrifice.   Her Billets she together calls ;   Th*n back for Flint and Denbigh /aZfe.     lu      F all the Cambrian Shires their heads that bear so   high,  And farth'st survey their soils with an ambitious eye,  Mervinki} for her Hills, as for their matchless crowds,  The nearest that are said to kiss the wand'ring clouds.  Especial audience craves, offended with the throng, j.   That she of all the rest neglected was so long :     Merionofhflih'e.     VDL. II.     V     2 POLY-OLBION,   Alleging for herself, When, through the Saxons' pride,  The God-like race of Bmie to Severne's setting side  Were cruelly inforc'd, her Mountains did relieve  Those, whom devouring war else ev'rywhere did grieve, lo  And when all JFales beside (by fortune or by might)  Unto her ancient foe resign'd her ancient right,  A constant Maiden still she only did remain,  § The last her genuine laws which stoutly did retain.  And as each one is prais'd for her peculiar things ; is   So only she is rich, in Mountains, Meres, and Springs,  And holds herself as great in her superfluous waste,  As others by their Towns, and fruitful tillage, grac'd.  And therefore, to recount her Elvers from their lins,*  Abridging all delays, Mervinia thus begins : 20   ^Though Dovy, which doth far her neighboring Floods sur-  mount  (Whose course, for hers alone Mmintgcmurii doth account)  Hath Angell for her own, and Kerlog she doth clear,  With Tow'm, Qwedall then, and JJidas, all as dear.  Those tributary streams she is maintain'd withall ; 25   Yet, boldly may I say, her rising and her fall  My Country calleth hers, with many another brook,  That with their crystal eyes on the Vcrgkian look.  To Dovji next, of which Desiinni/ sea- ward drives,  Lingwrlll goes alone ; but plenteous Avon strives 30   The first to be at sea ; and faster her to hie.  Clear Kemlguin comes in, with Ilergimi by-and-by.  So Ikrnj, Moollnj draws, and MunUiji calleth Caine,  Wliich in one channel meet, in going to the Main,  As to their utmost pow'r to lend her all their aids : 35   So Atro by the arm Limbeder kindly leads.   * Meres or Pools, from whence Rivera a])rin&lt;;.   ^ Tlic llivcrs as in order they fall into the Jrisli Sea.     THE NINTH SONG. 3   And Fehnr'ul the like, observing th' other's law,   Calls Cmndl ; she again fair Dmrld forth doth draw.   That from their mother Earth, the rough Mervinia, pay   Their mix6d plenteous Springs, unto the lesser Bay 4o   § Of those two noble arms into the land that bear, '3   Which through Givinethla?- be so famous everywhere,   On ray Carnarvan side by nature made my Mound,   As Doinj doth divide the Cardiganian ground.   The pearly Comvaye's head, as that of holy Dee, 45   Renowned Rivers both, their rising have in me :   So, Lavern and the Lue, themselves that head-long throw   § Into the spacious Lake, where Dee unmix'd doth flow.   Trnicerriii takes his stream here from a native lin ;   Which, out of Plmblemere when Dee himself doth win, 50   Along with him his Lord full courteously doth glide :   So Eudock riseth here, and Cletor that do guide   Him in his rugged path, and make his greatness way,   Their Dee into the bounds of Denbigh to convey.   The lofty Hills, this while attentively that stood, 55   As to survey the course of every several Flood,  Sent forth such echoing shouts (which every way so shrill.  With the reverberate sound the spacious air did fill)  That they were eas'ly heard through the Vergman IVLain  To Neplanc's inward Court ; and beating there, constrain 60  That mighty God of sea t' awake : who full of dread,  Thrice threw his three-fork'd Mace about his grisly head,  And thrice above the rocks his forehead rais'd to see  Amongst the high-topp'd Hills what tumult it should be. ■  So that with very sweat Cadoridrlc did drop, 1 go   And mighty llaran shook his proud sky -kissing top.  Amongst the furious rout Avhom madness did enrage ;  Until the Mountain-Nymphs, the tumult to assuage,   «   1 North- If a?e5.   1-2     4 rOLY-OLBION,   Upon a modest sign of silence to the throng,   Consorting thus, in praise of their 3Ierviniu, song : 70   Thrice famous Saxon King, on whom Time ne'er shall prey,  Eihjar ! who compell'dst our Ludwall hence to pay  Three hundred Avolves a year for tribute unto thee :  And for that tribute paid, as ftimous may'st thou be,  conquer'd British King, by whom was first destroy'd 75  § The multitude of wolves, that long this land annoy'd ;  Eegardless of their rape, that now our harmless flocks  Securely here may sit upon the aged rocks ;  Or wand'ring from their walks, and straggling here and there  Amongst the scatt'red cleeves, the lamb needs never fear; so  But from the threat'ning storm to save itself may creep  Into that darksome cave where once his foe did keep :  That now the clamb'ring goat all day which having fed,  And climbing up to see the sun go down to bed,  Is not at all in doubt her little kid to lose, 85   Which grazing in the vale, secure and safe she knows.   Where, from these lofty hills^ which spacious heaven do  Yet of as equal height, as thick by nature set, [threat.   We talk how we are stor'd, or what we greatly need.  Or how our flocks do fare, and how our herds do feed, 90  When else the hanging rocks, and valleys dark and deej).  The summer's longest day would us from meeting keep.   Ye Cambrian Shepherds then, Avhom these our Mountains  And ye our fellow Kymphs, ye light Oreadts,* [please,   Saint Ilekn's wondrous way, and Herbert's, let us go, 95   And our divided liocks with admiration show.   Not meaning there to end, but speaking as they were,  A sudden fearful noise surprised every ear.  The Water-Nymphs (not far) Liii-Teyed that frequent.  With brows besmear'd with ooze, their locks with de w bes2)rent,   ^ The wondrous Mountains in ^erionethshir .  * KymijliB of the Mountains.     THE NINTH SONG. 5   Inhabiting the Lake, in sedgy bow'rs belovr, im   Their inward grounded grief that only sought to show  Against the Mountain-kind, which much on them did take  Above their wat'ry brood, thus proudly them bespake :   Tell us, ye haughty Hills, why vainly thus you threat, los  Esteeming us so mean, compar'd to yoti so great.  To make you know yourselves, you tliis must understand,  That our great Maker laid the surface of the Land,  § As level as the Lake until the general Flood,  When over all so long the troubled waters stood : no   Which, hurried with the blasts from angry heaven that blew.  Upon huge massy heaps the loosened gravel threw :  From hence we would ye know, your first beginning came.  Which, since, in tract of time, yourselves did Mountains name.  So that the earth, by you (to check her mirthful cheer) 115  May always see (from heaven) those plagues that pour(^d were  Upon the former world ; as 't were by scars to show  That still she must remain disfigur'd with the blow :  And by th' infectious slime that doomful Deluge left,  Nature herself hath since of purity been reft ; 120   And by the seeds corrupt, the life of mortal man  Was short'ned. With these plagues ye Mountains first began.   But, ceasing you to shame, What Mountain is there found  In all your monstrous kind (seek ye the Island round)  That truly of himself such wonders can report 125   As can this spacious Lin, the place of our resort 1  That when Dee in his course fain in her lap would lie,  Commixtion with her store his stream she doth deny.  By his complexion prov'd, as he through her doth glide.^  Her wealth again from his, she likewise doth divide : 130  Those White-fish that in her do wondrously abound,  Are never seen in him ; nor are his Salmons found  At any time in her : but as she him disdains,   ^ The wonders of L'm-teged, or Pembh-mere.     6 POLV-OLBION,   So he again, from her as wilfully abstains. [that fall,   Down from the neighbouring Hills, those plenteous Springs  Nor Land-floods after rain, her never move at all. i36   And as in summer's heat, so always is she one,  Resembling that great Lake which seems to care for none :  § And with stern JEolus blasts, like Thetis waxing rank,  She only over-swells the surface of her bank. i40   But, whilst the Nymphs report these wonders of their  Lake,  Their further cause of speech the mighty Snoicdon^ brake ;  Least, if their wat'ry kind should suff'red be too long,  The licence that they took might do the Mountains wrong.  For quickly he had found that strait'ned Point of Land, 145  Lito the Irish Sea which puts his pow'rful hand,  Puff'd with their wat'ry praise, grew insolently proud.  And needs would have his Rills for Rivers be allow'd ;  Short Darent, near'st unto the utmost point of all  That th' Isle of Gelin greets, and Banlsey in her fall ; iso  And next to her, the Sawe, the Gir, the Er, the May,  Must Rivers be at least, should all the world gainsay:  And those, whereas the land lies Eastward, amply wide,  That goodly Conway grace upon the other side,  Born near upon her banks, each from her proper Lin, 155  Soon from their Mothers out, soon with their Mistress in.  As Ledder, her ally, and neighbour Ler/tcy; then  Goes Purloyd, Castell next, with GiJ/in, that again  Observe fair Conway's course: and though their race be short,  Yet they their Sovereign Flood inrich with their resort, leo  And Siancdon, more than this, his proper mere did note  (§ Still Dclos-like, wherein a wand'ring isle doth float)  Was peremptory grown upon his higher ground ;  That Pool, in which (besides) the one-eyed fish are found,  As of lier wonder proud, did with the Floods partake.- 105   ' The most famous ^fountain of all Wales, in CamarvanMre.  2 The wonders upou the Snuwdoit.     THE NIXTH SONG, J   So, when great Siiowdon saw, a faction tliey would make  Against his general kind ; both parties to appease,  He purposeth to sing their native Princes' praise.  For SiMwdomj, a Hill, imperial in his seat.  Is from his mighty foot unto his head so great, ito   That were his IFaks distrest, or of his help had need,  He all her flocks and herds for many months could feed.^  Therefore to do some thing were worthy of his name.  Both tending to his strengtli, and to the Britaiis' fame,  His Country to content, a signal having made, it5   By this oration thinks both parties to persuade ;   Whilst here this general Isle, the ancient Britans ow'd.  Their valiant deeds before by Severne have been show'd :  But, since our furious foe, these pow'rful Saxon swarms  (As merciless in spoil, as well approv'd in arms) iso   Here called to our aid, Lo'egria us bereft,  Those poor and scatt'red few of Bratts high linage left,  For succour hither came ; where that unmixed race  Remains unto this day, yet owners of this place :  Of whom no Flood nor Hill peculiarly hath song. iS5   These, then, shall be my theme; lest Time too much should   Avrong  Such Princes as were ours, since sever'd we have been ;  And as themselves, their fame be limited between  The Severm and our Sea, long pent within this place,  § Till with the term of JVehh, the English now embase 190  The nobler Britans' name, that well-near was destroy'd  With pestilence and war, which this great Isle annoy'd ;  Cad trail ader that drave to the Armor ic shore :  To which, dread Conan, Lord of Denbigh, long before.  His countrymen from hence auspiciously convey 'd : iti5.   Whose noble feats in war, and never-failing aid,   ^ The glory of Snowdon-hill.     8 POLY-OLBION,   Got Maximus (at length) the victory in Gaul,  Upon the Roman Powers. Where, after Gratian's fall,  Armorica to them the valiant Victor gave :  Where Conan, their great Lord, as full of courage, drave 200  The Cells out of their seats, and did their room supply  With people still from hence ; which of our Colony  § Was Little Bnlain call'd. Where that distressed King,  Ciulwallader, himself awhile recomforting  With hope of Alan's aid (which there did him detain) 205  § Forewarned was in dreams, that of the Britan^ reign  A sempiternal end the angry Powers decreed,  A recluse life in Home injoining him to lead.  The King resigning all, his son young Edu-all left  With Alan: who, much griev'd the Prince should be bereft  Of Britain's ancient right, rigg'd his unconquer'd fleet ; 211  And as the Generals then, for such an army meet,  His Nephew Ivor chose, and Hiner for his pheere ;  Two most undaunted spirits. These valiant Britans were  The first who JKest-sci^ won. But by the ling'ring war, 215  When they those Samns found t' have succour still from l;tr.  They took them to their friends on Severne's setting shore :  Where finding Edwall dead, they purpos'd to restore  His son young Bodorick, whom the Saocou Powers pursu'd :  But he, who at his home here scorn'd to be subdu'd, 220  With Aldred (that on //'rr/cs his strong invasion brought)  (larlhmaluck, and Feucoyd (those famous battles) fought.  That Noiih and SoniJi-irales sing, on the West-Sexians won.  Scarce this victorious task his bloodied sword had done.  But at Mount Canw^ met the Mercians, and with wounds 225  Made Ethdhuld to feel his trespass on our bounds ;  Prevail'd against the Pid, before our force that flew ;  And in a valiant fight their King Dalargan slew.   * The Wrtit-Saxom' country, comprehending Devomhire, Somerset^  WVtxlurc, and their adjacents.  ^ A hill near Abcr-(javcnuij in Al onmouth.     THE NINTH SONG. 9   Nor Conan's courage less, nor less prevail'd in ought  Renowned RodoricMs lieir, who with the English fought 230  The Herefordlcm Field ; as Ruthlands red with gore :  Who, to transfer the war from this his native shore,  March'd through the Mercian Towns with his revengeful   blade ;  And on the English there such mighty havock made,  That Offa (when he saw his Countries go to wrack) 235   From bick'ring with his folk, to keep us Britans back.  Cast up that mighty Mound of eighty miles in length,^  Athwart from sea to sea. Which of the Mercians' strength  A witness though it stand, and Offa's name do bear,  Our courage was the cause why first he cut it there : 240  As that most dreadful day at Gavelfard can tell,  Where under either's sword so many thousands fell  With intermix(§d blood, that neither knew their own ;  Nor which went victor thence, unto this day is known. '   Nor Kettle's conflict then, less martial courage show'd, 245  Where valiant Mervin met the Mercians, and bestow'd  His nobler British blood on Burthred's recreant flight.   As Rodorick his great son, his father following right.  Bare not the Saxons' scorns, his Britans to out-brave ;  At Gwijthen, but again to Burthred battle gave ; 250   Twice driving out the Bane when he invasion brought.  Whose no less valiant son, again at Conway fought  With Dams and Mercians mix'd, and on their hateful head  Down-show'r'd their dire revenge whom they had murther«5d.   And, were 't not that of us the English would report 255  (Abusing of our Tongue in most malicious sort  As often-tiraes they do) that more than any, we  (The Welsh, as they us term) love glorified to be,  Here could I else recount the slauglit'red Saxons' gore  Our swords at Crosford spilt on Sever ne's wand'ring shore; 200   1 Ofa's Ditch.     10 POLY-OLBION,   And Giiffifh here produce, LewelUn's valiant son  {May we believe our Bards) who five pitch'd battles won ;  And to revenge the wrongs the envious Ewjllsh wrought,  His well-train'd martial troops into the IMarches brought  As far as fFor'stcr walls : nor thence did he retire, 265   Till Poivse lay well-near spent in our revengeful fire ;  As Hereford laid waste : and from their plenteous soils,  Brought back with him to JFuh's his prisoners and his spoils.   Thus as we valiant were, Avhen valour might us steed,  With those so much that dar'd, we had them that decreed.  For, what Mulmutian laws, or Martian, ever were an   § INIore excellent than those which our good Hoicell here  Ordain'd to govern JFales ? which still with us remain.   And when all-powerful Fate had brought to pass again,  That as the Sa.wns erst did from the Britans win ; 275   Upon them so (at last) the Nm-mans coming in,  Took from those Tyrants here, what treach'rously they got,  (To the perfidious French, which th' angry heavens allot)  Ne'er could that Conqueror's sword (which roughly did decide  His right in EiKjland liere, and prostrated her pride) 2so  § Us to subjection stoop, or make us Brllans bear  Th' unwieldy Norman yoke : nor basely could we fear  His Conquest, ent'ring Wales; but (with stout courage) ours  Defied him to his face, with all his Englhh Pow'rs.   And when in his revenge, proud Biifus hither came 285  (With vows) us to sulivert ; with slaughter and with shame.  O'er Sever/ie him we sent, to gather stronger aid.   So, ^hen to England's power, Alhanht hers had laid.  By Henry Beaudarke brought (for all his devilish wit,  By which he raught the AVreath) he not prevail'd a whit: 2no  And through our rugged straits when he so rudely prest.  Had not his proved mail sate surely to his breast,  A skilful British hand his life had him bereft,  As his stern brother's heart by Tirrill's hand was cleft.     THE NINTH SONG. 11   And let the English thus which vilify our name, 295   If it their greatness please, report unto our shame  The foil our Givyneth gave, at Frmfs so deadly fight,  To Maud the Empress' son, that there he put to flight ;  § And from the Eiiijli.sh pow'r th' imperial ensign took :  About his plumed head which valiant Oiveii shook. soo   As when that King again, his fortune to advance  Above his former foil, procur'd fresh powers from France,  A surely-levell'd shaft if Sent-ckare had not seen,  And in the very loose not thrust himself between  His Sovereign and the shaft, he our revenge had tried : 305  Thus, to preserve the King, the noble subject died.   As Madock his brave son, may come the rest among ;  Who, like the God-like race from which his grandsires   sprong.  Whilst here his brothers tir'd in sad domestic strife,  On their unnatural breasts bent either's murtherous knife ;  This brave adventurous youth, in hot pursuit of fame, 311  With such as his great spirit did with high deeds inflame,  Put forth his well-rigg'd fleet to seek him foreign ground, j  And sailed West so long, until that world he found  To Christians then unknown (save this adventurous crew)  Long ere Colujithns liv'd, or it Fesputius knew ; 316   And put the now-nam'd IP^ehh on India s parched face,  Unto the endless praise of Brute's renowned race.  Ere the Iberian Powers had touch'd her long-sought Bay,  § Or any ear had heard the sound of Florida. 320   § And with that Croggcus name let th' English us disgrace;  When there are to be seen, yet, in that ancient place  From whence that name they fetch, their concjuer'd grand-  sires' graves :  For which each ignorant sot unjustly us depraves.   And when that Tyrant John had our subversion vow'd, 325  § To his unbridled will our necks we never bow'd :     12 POLY-OLBION,   Nor to his mighty son ; whose host we did inforce  (His succours cutting off) to eat their warlike horse.   Until all-ruling Heaven would have us to resign :  When that brave Prince, the last of all the British Line, 330  Lewellin, Griffith's son, unluckily was slain,  § As Fate had spar'd our fall till Edward Longshanks' reign.  Yet to the stock of Brute so true we ever were,  We would permit no Prince, unless a native here.  Which, that most prudent King perceiving, wisely thought  To satisfy our wills, and to Carnarvan brought aso   His Queen being great with child, ev'n ready down to lie ;  Then to his purpos'd end doth all his powers apply.   Through ev'ry part of JVales he to the Nobles sent,  That they unto his Court sliould come incontinent, 340   Of things that much concern'd the Country to debate :  But now behold the power of unavoided Fate.   When thus unto his will he fitly tliem had won.  At her expected hour the Queen brought forth a son.  And to this great design, all happ'ning as he would, 345  He (his intended course that clerkly manage could)  Thus quaintly trains us on : Since he perceiv'd us prone  Here only to be rul'd by Princes of our own.  Our naturalness therein he greatly did approve -^  And publicly protests, that for the ancient love 3:;o   He ever bare to Wales, they all should i)lainly see.  That he had found out one, their sovereign Lord to be ;  Com'n of the race of Kings, and (in their Country born)  Could not one English word : of which he durst be sworn.  Besides, his upright heart, and innocence was such, 355   As that (he was assur'd) black Envy could not touch  His spotless life in ought. Poor Ave (that not espy  His subtlety herein) in plain simplicity   ^ A King both valiant and politic.     THE NINTH SONG. 13   Soon bound ourselves by oath, his choice not to refuse :  When as that crafty King his little child doth choose, 36o  Young Edward, born in IFales, and of Carnarvan call'd.  Thus by the English craft, we Britans were enthrall'd :   Yet in thine own behalf, dear Country dare to say,  Thou long as powerful wert as Eiujland every way.  And if she overmuch should seek thee to imbase, sas   Tell her thou art the Nurse of all the British race j  And he that was by heaven appointed to unite  (After that tedious war) the Eed Rose and the AYhite,  A Tudor was of thine, and native of thy Mon,  From Avhom descends that King now sitting on her Throne.   This speech, by Siiowduii made, so lucky was to please 371  Both parties, and them both with such content t' appease,  That as before they strove for sovereignty and place,  They only now contend, Avhich most should other grace.   Into the Irish Sea, then all those Eills that ron, 375   In Snoivdou's praise to speak, immediately begon ;  Lewenny, Lijnart next, then Givdhj gave it out,  And Kerriog her compeer soon told it all about :  So did their sister-Nymphs, that into Me7ia strain •  The Flood that doth divide Hon from the Cambrian Main, sso  It Gorwaij greatly prais'd, and Seint it loudly song.  So, mighty Suowdou's speech was through Carnarvan rong ;  That scarcely such a noise to 3Ioii from Menu came,  When with his puissant troops for conquest of the same.  On bridges made of boats, the Roman Powers her sought, ass  Or Edward to her sack his English armies brought :  That Mona strangely stirr'd great Snowdon's praise to hear,  Although the stock of Tro;/ to her was ever dear ;  Yet (from her proper worth) as she before all other  § Was call'd (in former times) her Country Cambria's mother.  Persuaded was thereby her praises to pursue, syi   Or by neglect, to lose what to herself was due,     14 POLY-OLBION,   A sign to Neptune sent, his boist'rous rage to slake ;  Which suddenly becalm'd, thus of herself she spake :   What one of all the Isles to Cambria doth belong 395   (To Britain, I might say, and yet not do her wrong)  Doth equal me in soil, so good for grass and grain 1  As should my JVales (where still Brute's offspring doth remain)  That mighty store of men, yet more of beasts doth breed.  By famine or by war constrained be to need, 400   And England's neighhonring Shires their succour would deny;  My only self her wants could plenteously supply.   What Island is there found upon the Irish coast,  In which that Kingdom seems to be delighted most  (And seek you all along the rough' Vergivian shore, 4or,   Where the incount'ring tides outrageously do roar)  That bows not at my beck, as they to me did owe  The duty subjects sliould unto their Sovereign show?  § So that th' Euhonian Man, a kingdom long time known,  AVhich wisely hath been rul'd by Princes of her own, 410  In my alliance joys, as in th' Albanian Seas  The Arrans,'^ and by them the scatt'red Eubidcs,^  Eejoice even at my name ; and put on mirthful cheer.  When of my good estate, they by the Sea-Nymphs hear.   Sometimes within my shades, in many an ancient wood,  Whose often-twint^d tops great Fhcebus' fires withstood, 410  § The fearless British Priests, under an aged oak,  Taking a milk-white bull, unstrained with the yoke,  And with an axe of gold from that ./(«'c'-sacred tree  The Mistletoe cut down ; then with a bended knee 420   On th' unhew'd altar laid, put to the hallow'd fires :  And whilst in the sharp flame the trembling flesh expires,  As their strong fury mov'd (when all the rest adore)  Pronouncing their desires the sacrifice before,   ^ Isles upou the West of Scotland,     THE NINTH SONG. 15   Up to th' eternal heav'n their bloodied hands did rear : 425  And, whilst the murmuring woods ev'n shudd'red as with   fear,  Preach'd to the beardless youth, the soul's immortal state,  To other bodies still how it should transmigrate.  That to contempt of death them strongly might excite.   To dwell in my black shades the Wood-gods did delight,  Untrodden with resort that long so gloomy were, 431   As when the Roman came, it strook him sad with fear  To look upon my face, which then was call'd the Dark;  Until in after time, the English for a mark  Gave me this hateful name, which I must ever bear, 435  And Anglesi'i} from them am called everywhere.   My Brooks (to whose sweet brims the Sijlvam did resort,  In gliding through my shades, to mighty Neptune's Court,. ■  Of their huge oaks bereft) to heaven so open lie.  That now there's not a root discern'd by any eye : 440   My Brent, a pretty beck, attending Meiia's mouth.  With those her sister rills, that bear upon the South,  Gwlnt, forth along with her Lewenny that doth draw ;  And next to them again, the fat and moory Frawe,  § Which with my Prince's Court I sometime pleas'd to  grace, 445   As those that to the West directly run their race.  Smooth Alio in her fall, that Lynon in doth take ;  Mathanon, that amain doth tovv'rds Moylroniad make,  The sea-calfs to behold that bleach them on her shore,  Which Giveger to her gets, as to increase her store. 450   Then Didas to the North that stiaineth, as to see  The Isle that breedeth mice : whose store so loathsome be,  That she in Neptwm's brack her bluish head doth hide.   When now the wearied Muse her burthen having ply'd.  Herself awhile betakes to bathe her in the Sound; 405   And quitting in her course the goodly Mon'uin ground,     16     POLY-OLBION.     Assays the Penmemnaur, and her clear eyes doth throw  On Comcay, tow'rds the East, to England back to go :  Where finding Denbigh fair, and Flint not out of sight,  Cries yet afresh for Jrales, and for Brute's ancient right. 409      ILLUSTRATIONS.

Under William Rnfus, the Norman-English (animated by  the good success which Bohert Flts-hamon had first against  Rees ap Tiddour, Prince oi South-Wales, and afterward against  Jestin, Lord of Glamorgan) being very desirous of these Welsh  territories ; Hugh, surnamed Wolfe,^ Earl of Chester, did ho-  mage to the King for Tegengl and Rijvonioc, with all the land  by the sea unto Comcey. And thus pretending title, got also  possession of Merioneth, from Gntjjith ap Coium, Prince of  Nmilh-Wales : but he soon recovered it, and thence left it  continued in his posterity, until Lhewehjin ap GruJ/ifh, under  Edward I., lost it, himself, and all his dominion. \Mu'reas  other parts (of South and I Vest- Wales especially) had before  subjected themselves to the English Crown ; this, through  frequency of craggy mountains, accessible with too much  difficulty, being the last strong refuge until that period of  fatal conquest.     ^ Powel. ad Carailoc.

For this name of JFehh is unknown to the British them-  selves, and imposed on them, as an ancient and common  opinion is, by the Saxons, calling them Walsh, i.e., strangers.

But you shall come nearer truth, if  upon the community of name, customs, and original, twixt  the Gauls and iiiitons, you conjecture them called Walsh, as  it were, Gualsh (the /A'often-times being instead of the Gu),  which expresses them to be Gauls rather than strangers ;   ' Pindar, ap.

There be* also that will justify the British name to have  been in that tract long before, and for proof cite Dionysim^  Afcr, and riiiui;^ but for the first, it is not likely that he  ever meant that Continent, but this of ours, as the learned  tell you: and for Pliny, seeing he reckons his Britons of Gaul-  in the confines of the now France, and Lower Germany, it is  as unlikely that twixt them and Little Breiaigne should be  any such habitude. You want not authority, affirming that  our Britons from them,' before they from ours, had deduc-  tion of this national title; but my belief admits it not. The  surer opinion is to refer the name unto those Britons, which  (being expelled the Island at the entry of the Saxons) got  them new habitation in this maritime part, as beside other  authority an express assertion is in an old fragment of a  French history,** which you may join with most worthy  Camden's treatise on this matter; whither (for a learned de-  claration of it) I send you.   1 Buchanan.

Cadicallader driven to forsake this land, especially by-  reason of plague and famine, tyrannizing among his subjects,  joined with continual irruptions of the English, retired him-  self into Little Bretaigne, to his cousin Alan there King :  where, in a dream, he was admonished by an angel (I justify  it but by the story) that a period of the British Empire was  now come, and until time of Merlin's prophecy, given to  King Arthur, his country or posterity should have no resti-  tution ; and further, that he should take his journey to  Eome, where for a transitory he might receive an eternal  Kingdom. Alan, upon report of this vision, compares it  with the Eagles prophecies, the SihjWs verses, and Merlin ;  nor found he but all were concording in prediction of this  ceasing of the Britit&gt;h Monarchy.^ Through his advice there-  fore, and a prepared affection, Cadwallader takes voyage to  Borne, received of PP. Sergius, with holy tincture, the name  of Peter, and within very short time there died ; his body  very lately under Pope Gregori/ the XIII. was found- buried  by S. Peter's Tomb, where it yet remains; and Jl'hite of  Basingstoke says, he had a piece of his raiment of a chesnut  colour, taken up (with the corpse) uncorrupted ; which he  accounts, as a Romish pupil, no slight miracle. It was added  among British traditions, that, when Cadivallader's bones^  Were brought into this Isle, then should the posterity of  their Princes have restitution : concerning that, you have  enough to the Second Song. Observing concurrence of time  and difference of relation in the story of this Prince, I know  not well how to give myself or the reader satisfaction.

TEE NINTH SONG. \ 23   Cadwallader is made the son of Ciulwallo King of the Brilom  before him ; but so, that he descended also from Enrjlkh-  Saxon blood ; his mother being daughter to Fenda King of  Mercland. Our JMonks call him King of West-Saxons, suc-  cessor to Kentwiiie, and son to Kenhrith. And where Caradoc  Lhancarvan tells you of wars twixt Lie or Ivor (successor to  Cadioallader) and Keidwine, it appears in our chronographers  that Kentwine must be dead abov^e three years before. But  howsoever these things might be reconcileable, I think  clearly that Cadwallader in the British, and Cedwalla^ King  of West-Saxons in Bede, Malmesburij, Florence, Huntingdon,  and other stories of the English, are not the same, as Geffrc;/,  and, out of Girald, Fuindall of Chester, and others since erro-  neously have affirmed. But strongly you may hold, that  Cadivallo or Caswallo, living about 840, slain by Oswald King  of Northumberland, was the same with Bede's first CedwaUa,  Avhom he calls King of Britons, and that by misconceit of his  two Cedwals (the other being, almost fifty years after. King  of IFest-Saxons) and by communicating of each other's attri-  butes upon indistinct names, without observation of their  several times, these discordant relations of them, which in  story are too palpable, had their first being. But to satisfy  you in present, I keep myself to the course of our ordinary  stories, by reason of difficulty in finding an exact truth in  all. Touching his going to Botne; thus: Some will, that he  was Christian before, and received of Sergius only Confirma-  tion ; others, that he had there his first Baptism, and lived  not above a month after; which time (to make all dissonant)  is extended to eight years in IJutncarvau. That, one King  Cedwidl went to Fome, is plain by all, with his new-imposed  name and burial there : For his baptism before, I have no   ^ Cedwalla Rex Britonmn Bod. Hist.

The very  phrase in most of our Historians is plain that he was bap-  tized ; and so also his epitaph then made at Home, in part  here inserted.   1 Fercipi^nsqiie alacer recUvkw prcemia vitce,  Barharicam rabiem, nomen et inde suum   Conversus convertit ovans : Petrumque vocari,  Sergius antistes jussit, ut ipse pater   Fonte renascentis, quern Christi gratia purgans  Protinus ablatum vexit in arce poli.   This shows also his short life afterward, and agrees fully  wdth the English story. His honorable affection to Religion,  before his cleansing mark of regeneration, is seen in that  kind respect given by him to jnifrld first Bishop of Selesey  in Sussex ; where the Episcopal See of Chichester (hither was  it translated from Selesey, under JFlUiam the Conqueror)  acknowledges in public monuments rather him founder  than Edilwukh the first Christian King of that Province,  from whom Cedicalla violently took both life and kingdom :  nor doth it less appear, in that his paying Tenths of such  spoils, as by war's fortune, accrued to his greatness ; which  notwithstanding, although done by one then not received  into the Church of either Testament, is not without many  examples among the ancient Gentiles, who therein imitating  the Hebrews, tithed much of their possessions, and acquired  substance to such Deities as unhallowed religion taught  them to adore ; which, whether they did upon mystery in   ' Bed.

Speaking of this, I cannot but wonder at  that very wonder of learning Joseph Scaliger,^ affirming,  tithes among those ancients only payable to Hercules:  whereas by express witness of an old inscription^ at Delphos,  and the common report of Camillus, it is justified, that both  Ch-eeks and Romans did the like to Apollo, and no less among  them and others together, was to 3Iars,^ Jupiter,^ Jum,^ and  the number of Gods in general, to whom the Athenians  dedicated the Tenth part of Lesbos.^ He which the Author,  after the British, calls here Ivor, is affirmed the same Avith  Lie King of Westsex in our Monkish Chronicles, although  there be scarce any congruity twixt them in his descent.

To clear himself, he challenges the combat : they  both, with the royal assent and judicial course by law of  arms, enter the lists ; where Montfort had the victory, and  Essex pardoned for his life ; but forfeiting'^ all his substance,  entered Eeligion, and professed in the Abbey of Beading,  where the combat was performed.

Sufficiently justifiable is this of King John, although our  Monks therein not much discording from British relation,  deliver, that he subdued all Jf'ales; especially this Xorthern*  part unto Snoicdun, and received twenty hostages for surety  of future obedience. For, at first, Lhewelin a|) Joru-erth,  Prince of North-lFales, had by force joined with strata-  gem the better hand, and compelled the English Camp  to victual themselves with horse-fiesh ; but afterward in-  deed upon a second rode made into Jl\iks, King John had  the conquest.

All this was confirmed by oath, but the oath, through  favour, purchased at Borne, and delegate authority in that  kind to the Abbots of C'oivei/ and llemer, was (according to  persuasion of those times, the more easily induced, because  gain of Regal liberty was the consequent) soon released,  and in lieu of obedience, they all drew their rebellious  swords ; wliereto they were the sooner urged, for that the  King had transferred the Principality of J Talcs'- (by name of   1 Charta Davidis 25.

But Avhen this  Edward, after his father, succeeded in the English Crown, ^  soon came that fatal conversion, here spoken of by the  Author, even executed in as great and worthy a Prince, as  ever that third part of the Isle was ruled by; that is  Lhewdin a^ Grvffiitli, who (after uncertain fortune of war,  on both sides, and revolting of Southirales) was constrained  to enter a truce (or rather subjection) resigning his Princi-  pality to be annexed wholly to the Crown, after his death,  and reserving, for his life only, the Isle of Anglesey and five  Baronies in Snowdon, for which the King's Exchequer should  receive a yearly rent of one thousand marks, granting also  that all the Baronies in JVales should be held of the King,  excepting those five reserved, with divers other particulars  in Walsingluim, Mattheio of Westminster, Nicholas Trivet, and  Humfrey Lhuyd, at large reported. The Articles of this  instrument were not long observed, but at length the death  of Llieioelin, spending his last breath for maintenance of his  ancestors' rights against his own covenant, freely cast upon  King Edinird all that, whereof he was, as it were, instituted  there.

The name of Druids hath been drawn from  AsDs, i.e., an Oak, because of their continual^ using that tree  as superstitiously hallowed ; according as they are called  also 2agov/6a/ or '^.u^mldig,^ which likewise, in Greek, is Old  Oak.

Nor is this without good reason  of conjecture (if the ground were true) seeing that their like  in proportion among the Jews and Gentiles were called (until  Pythigoras his time) JFise-men,* and afterward by him turned  into the name of Philosophers, i.e.. Lovers of wisdom ; and  perhaps the old Dutch was, as some learned think, commu-  nicated to Gaul, and from thence hither ; the conjecture  being somewhat aided in that attribute which they have in  Pomponius,^ calling them Masters of tvisdom. A late great  Scholar^ draws it from Cntttn, in an old Dutch copy of the  Gospel, signifying, as he says, God ; which might be given  them hy hyperbole of superstitious reverence; nay, we see  that it is justifiable by Holy Writ, so to call great Magis-  trates and Judges ; as they were among the people. But  that Avord Trutin or Trtichtin. in the old Angelical salutation,  Zachanfs Song, and Simeon's, published by Vulcan, is always  Lml ; as this ©ihithtt St tiniciitin got Ssraelo, i.e..

To speak of King Druis or Sarron, which that Dominican  Friar* hath cozened vulgar credulity withal, and thence  fetch their name, according to Doctor JFhite of Basingstoke,  Avere with him to suffer, and, at once, offer imposture. Of  them all, I incline to the first, seeing it meets in both  tongues Greek and British; and somewhat the rather too.     * a-oan ti?2K. i.e. dixerunt sapientes, Capnio de Art.

For their PROFESSION, it was  both of learning Profane and Holy (I speak in all, applying  my words to their times) : they sat as Judges, and deter-  mined all causes emergent, civil and criminal, subjecting the  disobedient, and such as made default to interdicts, and  censures, prohibiting them from sacred assemblies, taking  away their capacities in honourable offices, and so disabling  them, that (as our now out-laws, excommunicates, and at-  tainted persons) tliey miglit not commence suit against any  man. In a multitude of verses they delivered what they  taught, not suffering it to be committed to writing, so imi-  tating both Cahalists, Pi/thagoixans, and ancient Christians;^  but used in other private and public Inisiness Greek letters,  as Ccesar's copies have ; but hereof see more to the Tenth  Song.

For although AjkjUo, Mars, and Mercury were wor-  shipped among the vulgar Gauls, yet it appears that the  Druids' invocation was to one All-healing'^ or All-saving  power. In Morality, their instructions were so persuasive,  and themselves of such reverence, that the most fiery rage  of Mars kindled among the people, was by their grave coun-  sels often quenched.^ Out of Pliny receive their form of  ritual SACRIFICE (here described by the Author) thus:  In such gloomy shadows, as they most usually for contem-  plation retired their ascending thoughts into, after exact  search, finding an Oak, whereon a Mistletoe grew, on the  sixth day of the Moon (above all other times) in which was  beginning of their year, they religiously and with invocation  brought with them to it a ceremonial banquet, materials for  sacrifice, with two white Bulls, filleted on the horns, all  which they placed under the Oak. One of them, honoured  with that function, clothed all in white, climbs the tree, and  with a golden knife or scythe cuts the Mistletoe, which  they solemnly wrapped in one of their white garments.  Then did they sacrifice the Bulls, earnestly calling on the  All-healing* Deity to make it prosperous and happy on  whomsoever they shall bestow it, and accounted it both  preservative against all poisons, and a remedy against  barrenness. If I should imagine by this All-healing Deity  to be meant Ajwllo, whom they Avorshipped under name of  Belin (as I tell you to the Eighth Song) my conjecture were     1 Ad .Tehezkel. 4. ^ Plin.

And per-  adventure the Galatians' public Council called Drymenehtw}  had hence original. The British Druids took this Isle of  Anglesey (then well-stored with thick woods and religious  groves, insomuch that it was called 3)iti3-^oh3tl*) for their  chief residence ; as, in the Roman- story of FauUnus and  Agricola's adventuring on it, is delivered.

If I should upon testimony of,^  I know not what, Veremund, Camphell, and the Irish Cornill,  tell you that some hundred and sixty years before Christ,  Finnan King of Scotland first gave them the Isle, or that  King Crathlint in Diocletian's persecution, turned their reli-  gion into Christianism, and made Amphilmlus first Bishop of  Sodor, I sliould fabulously abuse time, as they have igno-  rantly mistook that Isle of Man for this.

Upon mistaking of Straho, and applying what he  saith in general, and bracelets and gold chains of the Gaids,  to the Druhh, I once thought that Conrad had been de-  ceived.

Against the handled cause and most doth seem to make, 2co  Is, that we show no book our Brutus to approve ;  But that our idle Bards, as their fond rage did move,  Sang what their fancies ploas'd.

So when injurious Time, such monuments doth lose   (As what so great a work, by Time that is not wrack'd ?)   AVe utterly forego that memorable act :   But when we lay it up within the minds of men, 275   They leave it their next Age ; that, leaves it hers again :   So strongly which (methinks) doth for Tradition make,   As if you from the world it altogether take,   You utterly subvert Antiquity thereby.   For though Time well may prove that often she doth lie, 28o   Posterity by her yet many things hath known.   That ere men learn'd to write, could no way have been shown :   For, if the Sj^irit of God did not our faith assure   The Scriptures be from heav'n, like heav'n divinely pure,   Of Moses' mighty works, I reverently may say 285   (I speak with godly fear) Tradition put away.   In pow'r of human wit it eas'ly doth not lie   To prove before the Flood the Genealogy.

Prophetic Merlin safe, ivhen to the British King.   In the first declining state of the British Empire (to ex-  ]^lain the Author in this of Merlin) Voiiigern, by advice of  his Magicians, after divers unfortunate successes in war, re-  solved to erect a strong Fort in Snowclon Hills (not far from  Conicey's head in the edge of Merioneth) which might be as  his last and surest refuge, against the increasing power of  the English. Masons were appointed, and the work begun ;  but what they built in the day, was always swallowed up in  the earth, next night. The King asks counsel of his Magi-  cians, touching this prodigy ; they advise that he must find  out a child which had no father, and with his l)lood sprinkle  the stones and mortar, and that then the Castle would stand  as on a firm foundation. Search was made, and in Caer-  Merdhin (as you have it to the Fifth Song) was Merlin Am-  brose found : he, being hither brought to the King, slighted     THE TENTH SONG. 57   that pretended skill of those Magicians as palliated igno-  rance ; and with confidence of a more knowing spirit, un-  dertakes to show the true cause of that amazing ruin of the  stone-work ; tells them that in the earth was a great water,  which could endure continuance of no heavy superstruction.  The workmen dia;2;ed to discover the truth, and found it so.  He then beseeches the King to cause them make further in-  quisition, and afBrms, that in the bottom of it were two  sleeping Dragons : which proved so likewise, the one icliite,  the other red ; the tvhite he interpreted for the Saxons, the  red for the Britons: and upon this event here in Dlnas  Emrijs} as they call it, began he those prophecies to Vorti-  gern, which are common in the British story. Hence ques-  tionless was that fiction of the Muses' best pupil, the noble  Spenser,'^ in supposing Merlin usually to visit his old Tiinon,  whose dwelling he places   low in a valley greene   Under the foot of Rauran mossie hore  From whence the River Dee as silver cleene  His tumhling billows rols ivith gentle rore.   For this Fumran-Vaur Hill is there by in Merioneth : but   observe withal, the difference of the Merlins, Ambrose, and   Sijlvester, which is before to the Fourth Song ; and permit   it only as poetical, that he makes King Arthir and this   Merlin of one time. These prophecies^ were by Geffrey a?i   Arthur at request of Alexander Bishop of Lincoln under   Hen. I. turned into Latin, and some three hundred years   since had interpretation bestowed on them by a German   Doctor, one Alanns de Insulis, who never before, but twice   shice that happy inauguration and mighty increase of do-   ^ Am.bro'ie's Barif.

This Vale of Cluid (for so is the English  of Snjjhrnu Clbaji^*) extended from the middle of Denbigh-  shire to the sea, about eighteen miles long, and some five  in breadth, having those three excellences, a fertile soil,  healthful air, and pleasant seat for habitation, washed  through the middle with this Eiver, and encompassed on  the East, West, and 8outh with high mountains, freely  receives the wholesome blasts of the North wind (much  accounted of among builders and geojionics for immission  of pure air) coming in from that part which lies open to  the sea : whereupon the Muse very properly makes the  Vale here Boreas his beloved ; and in respect of his violence  against the waters, supposeth hiui jealous of Xejifnne ;  whose ravishing waves in that troubled Irish Sea and the  depressed state of the Valley warrants it.

Xor think I any reasons more  difficult to be given, than those which are most specially  hidden, and most frequently strange in particular qualities  of Floods, 'Wells, and Springs ; in which (before all other)  Xature seems as if she had, for man's wonder, affected a  not intelligible variety, so different, so remote from conceit  of most piercing Avits ; and such unlooked-for operations  both of their first and second qualities (to use the School  phrase of them) are in every Clironographer, Naturalist,  and Historian.   139.

This title of exaction they purchased of FF. Martin V.  under Henry the Fifth and added more such gaining pre-  tences to themselves in time of Hen.

So that the  loss in this, and all kinds, to the commonwealth of letters,  hath been so grievous and irreparable, that we may well  imagine, how error of conceit in some, envy in others, and  hostile invasion hath bereft us of many monuments most  precious in all sorts of literature, if we now enjoyed their  instructing use : and to conclude, the antiquities of these  original ages are like those of Eome, between it built and  burnt by the Gauls ; Cum vetustate nimid ohscurce, velat quce  (as Livy says^) magno ex intervallo loci vix cernuntur* .- turn  quod perrarce per eadem tempora Literce fuere, una custodia  fidelis memorice rerum gestarum ; et quod, efiamsi quce hi  commentariis Pontificum aliisque puhUcis privatisque erant monu-  mentis, incensa urbe, pleraque interiere. But all this in effect  the Muse tells you in the Sixth Canto.   2or. To letters never would their mysteries commit.

In other  matters, private and public (so is Ccesar's assertion), they  used Greek letters,* which hath made some think that they  v.Tote Greek. But be not easil}- thereto persuaded. Perhaps  thev misht use Greel: characters.^ seeius; that those which the  Greeks then had, and now use, were at first received from  strangers,- and as likely from the Druids as from any other ;  for it is sufficiently justifiable out of old coins, inscriptions,  and express assertion,^ that the ancient character among the  Greeks was almost the same Avith that which is now the  Latins. But thence to collect that therefore they wrote or  spake Greek, is as if you should affirm the S/jriac Testament  to be Hebrew, because published in Hebrew letters ; or some  Latin Treatises Saxon, because in that character; or that  the Siixons wrote Irish, because they used the Lish form of  writing^ ; or that those books whirh are published in Dutth  by some Jeics in a special kind of Hcbrev: letter, should also  be of the same tongue.

But (if you will) add hereto that of the  famous and great lawyer Hotoman,^ who presumes that the  word Gra'cis* in Cccsar's text is crept in by ignorance of  transcribers, as he well might, seeing those Commentaries,  titled with name of /. Ca'sar, commonly published, and in  divers MSS. with /. Celsus, are very unperfect, now and  then abrupt, different in style, and so variable in their own  form, that it hath been much feared by that great critic  Lipsius,' lest some more impolite hand hath sewed many  patches of base cloth into that more rich web, as his own  metaphor expresses it. And if those characters which are  in the pillars at Y-Voellas in Denbighshire are of the Druids,  as some imagine (yet seeming very strange and uncouth)  then might you more confidently concur in opinion with  Hotoman. In sum, I know that Graxis Uteris may be taken  as well for the language (as in Justin^ I remember, and else-  where) as for the character : but here I can never think it  to be understood in any but the last sense, although you  admit Ccesar's copy to be therein not interpolated. It is  very justifiable which the Author here im])lies, by slighting  Ccesar's authority in British originals, ni respect that he  never came further into the Isle than a little beyond Thames  towards Barkeshire'^ ; although some of ours idly talk of his  making the Bath, and being at Chester, as the Scottish Histo-  rians most senselessly of their Willis ?i'off built by him,  which others refer to VespasianJ' some affirm it a Temple of  God Terminus'^ ; whereas it seems expressly to be built by  Carnusius, in time of Diocletian, if Nennius deceive us not.

In which he had been prov'd most exquisite to be ; vs   And bare his fame so far, that oft twixt him and Dee,  Much strife there hath arose in their prophetic skill.   But to conclude his praise, our Weever here doth will  The Muse, his source to sing ; as how his course he steers :  Who from his natural spring, as from his neighbouring   meres so   Sufficiently supply'd, shoots forth his silver breast,  As though he meant to take directly toward the East ;  Until at length it proves he loit'reth, but to play  Till Ashhrooke and the Lee o'ertake him on the wav,  'Which to his journey's end him earnestly do haste : w   Till having got to JFi/che, he taking there a taste  Of her most savoury salt, is by the sacred touch  Forc'd faster in his course, his motion quick'ned much  To North-ivyche : and at last, as he approacheth near,  Dane, Whelock draws, then Crock, from that black ominous   mere, 90   Accounted one of those that England's wonders make ;  Of neighbours, Black-mere nam'd, of strangers, Brereton's-   Lake ;  Whose property seems far from Eeason's way to stand :  For, near before his death that's owner of the land,  ►She sends up stocks of trees, that on the top do float ; ys  By which the world her first did for a wonder note.

For the name of Falatine, know, that in  ancient time under the Emperors of declining Borne, tiie  title of Count Palatine was ; but so, that ib extended first  only to him which had care of the Household and Imperial  revenue^ ; which is now (so saitli JFeseucbech- : I afiirm it  not) as the Marshal in other Courts ; but was also commu-  nicated by that honorary attribute of Gomitiva Dignitas to  many others, which had anything proportionate, place or  desert, as the Code teacheth xis. In later times both in  Germany (as you see in the Palgrave of Bhine) in France  (which the Earldom of Cliamjxigne shows long time since in  the Crown ; yet keeping a distinct Palatine Government, as  Peter Pithou^ hath at large published) and in this Kingdom  such were hereditarily honored with ib, as being near the  Prince in the Court (which they, as ^ve, called the Palace)  had by their state-carriage, gained full opinion of their  worth, and ability in government, by delegate jDower of ter-  ritories to them committed, and hereafter titled Coimtes cle  Palais, as our Law Annals call them.

From Woden, hy which name they stylid Mercury.  Of the Britons' descent from Jove, if you remember but  j^neas son to Anchises and Venus, with her derivation of  blood from Jiqjiter's parents, sufficient declaration will offer  itself. For this of IFoden, see somewhat to the Third  Song. To what you read there, I here more fitly add this : .  Woden, in Saxon genealogies, is ascended to as the chief  ancestor of their most royal progenies; so you may see in  Nennius, Bede, Ethelwerd, Florence of JVorcester, a.n Anoaymus  de Rerjali Prosapid, Huntingdon, and Horeden, yet in such  sort that in some of them they go beyond him, through  Frithwald, Frealaf, Frlthulf, Fin, Godtdph; Getcc, and others,  to Seth; but with so much uncertainty, that I imagine  many of their descents were just as true as the Theogony in  Hcslod, ApoUodoms, or that of Prester John's sometimes de-  riving himself' very near from the loins of Salomon. Df  this IVoden, beside my authors named, special mention  is found in Paul Warnfred,'^ who makes Frea his wife (others  call her Fricco, and by her understand Venus) and Adam of  Breme,^ wliich describe him as 3Iars, but in Geffrey of Mou-   ^ Levit. 2. comm. 13. et Num. 18. * Salt of the Covenant.   * Ciel. ilhoJigin.

If that allusion in the  Illustrations of the Third Song to Merc allow it him not,  tlien take the other first taught me by Lipsius^ fetching  Jf^ochi.n from SliSllott or SUtn, which is to gain, and so make  his name IFondan expressing in that sense the self name^  'EffjtA^s xs^buiog* used by the Greeks. But without this in-  (juiry you understand the Author.   178. Here put the German names upon the weekly days.   From their Sunnan for the Sun, Monan for the Moon,  Tuisco, or Tuisto (of whom see to the Fourth Song) for Mars,  Woden for Mercury, Thor for Jupiter, Fre, Frie, or Frlgo for  Venus, Sceturn for Saturn, they styled their days Sunnan-  hciej, Monan-hsej, tuij-cons-basj, pobenf-bsej, ])opj'-b?e5, ppij-  biej, Sa?tepnf-boej: thence came our days now used, Sunday,  Munday, Tuesday, JVodensday, Thursday, Friday, Satiirday;  which planetary account was very ancient among the  yEgyptians^ (having much Hebrew discipline), but so super-  stitious, that, being great astronomers and very observant  of mysteries produced out of ^umber and quantity, they  l)egan on the Jewish Sabbath and imposed the name of  Saturn, on the next the Sun, then the Moon, as we now  reckon, omitting two planets in every nomination, as you  easily conceive it. One might seek, yet miss the reasons of  that form; but nothing gives satisfaction equal to that of  all-penetrating Joseph Scaliger,* whose intended reason for it   ' Ad. Tacit.

In a circle describe an heptagonal and equilateral  figure; from whose every side shall fall equilateral triangles,  and their angles respectively on the corners of the inscribed  figure, which are noted with  the planets after their not in-  terrupted order. At the right  side of any of the bases begin  your account, from that to the  oppositely noted planet, thence  to his opposite, and so shall  you find a continued course in  that order (grounded perhaps  among the ancients upon  mysteries of number, and in-     terchanijed     government     by      those superior bodies over this habitable orb) which some  have sweated at, in inquiry of proportions, music distances,  and referred it to planetary hours : whereas they (the very  name of hour for a twenty-fourth part of a day, being un-  usual till about the Peloponnesiac war) had their original of  later time than this hebdomadal account, whence the hourly  from the morning of every day had his breeding, and not the  other from this, as pretending and vulgar astrologers receive  in supposition. At last, by Condantine the Great, and Pope  Sylvester, the name of Sun-day was turned into the Lord's-  day^ ; as it is styled Dominicus et Kvoiaxri ; of Saturday, into  the Sabbath; and the rest not long afterward named accord-  ing to their numeral order, as the First, Second, or Third  Feria (that is Holiday, thereby keeping the remembrance of  Easter-week, the beginning of tlie Ecclesiastic year, which  was kept every day holy) for Sunday, Munday, Tuesday.

JFIiite of Basingstoke'^ (I must cite his name,  you would laugh at me if I affirmed it) refers to Kent's  Paganism, and British Christianitg before this conversion, the  original of our vulgar by-word, Nor in Christeiulom, Nor in  Kent.   207.

' THE ELEVENTH SONG. 91   the Decreeing Epistle^ of Pope Tehsphorus, constituting that  the Clergy should fast from Qulu'piageshiKC (that is, Shrwe-  sundaij) to Easter, whereas the Laity and they both were  before bound but to six weeks accounted, as now, from the  first Sunday in Lent ; so that, even from the first^ of Chris-  tianity, for remembrance of our Saviour, it seems, it hath  been observed, although I know it hath been referred to  Telesijhonis, as hrst author. He died in 140 of Christ. But  if you compare this of him with that of Pope Mekhiades^  (some hundred and seventy years after) taking away the  fast upon Sunday, and Thursday, you will lose therein  forty days, and the common name of Qiuidragesime ; but  again lind it thus. S. Gregory'^ (after both these) makes Lent  to be so kept, that yet no fasting be upon Sundays ; because  (among other reasons) he would have it as the tenth of  time consecrated to God in prayer and abstinence (and the  Canonists,^ how justly I argue not, put it in their division  of Personal Tithes) then, in this form, after the exception,  calculates out his number. From the first Sunday in Lent  to Easier are six weeks, that is, forty-two days, whence  six Sundays subtracted, remain thirty-six, which (fractions  avoided) is the quotient of three hundred and sixty-five,  being the number of the common year divided by ten. But  seeing that holy number (as he calls it) of forty, which our  Saviour honoured with His fasting, is by this reckoning ex-  cluded, he adds, to the first week, the four last days of the  QuinquagesiriM, that is, A sli- Wednesday, 'Thursday, Friday, and  Saturday ; so keeping both his conceit of tithing, and also  observation of that number, which we remember only (not  able to imitate) in our assayed abstinence.

The Author fitly begins with him after  the Kentish ; for he was the first that made the number of  the Saxon Kings plural, by planting and here reigning over  the South Saxons'' : and as one was always in the Heptarchy,  which had title of First, or Chief King of the Angles and  Saxons, so this ^lla not only was honoured with it,* but  also the prerogative by priority of time, in first enjoining  it, before all other Princes of his nation : But his dominion  afterward was for the most part still under the Kentish and  Jf'est Saxon Kings.   210, Saint Wilfrid sent from York into his realm received.

JFerhurge  (by £rmengild daughter to Erconhert of Kent) but withal  that he was both Christian, and a great Benefactor to the  Church. For it appears by consent of all, that Peada, Weda,  or Fenda (all these names he hath) eldest son of the first  Ferula, first received in Middle Emjh (part of Merdan&lt;\l) the  Faith, and was baptized by Finnan Bishop of Lindisfarne* :  after whose violent death, in spite of Osicy King of Northum-  herlarul, Lnmin, Elba, and Edherth, gentlemen of power in  Mercland, saluted JVidplur (brother to Feada) King of all  that Province, who was then, as it seems (by Florence of  Worcester and Bede's reporting of four Bishops in succession  preferred by him) of Christian name : But howsoever he  was at that time, it is certain that in the second or third  years of his reign, he was godfather to King Edilwalch of  Sussex, and bestowed on him as a gift in token of that  spiritual adoption, the Isle of Wight with another territory  in West Saxony, and gave also to S. Cedda (made, by con-  sent of him and King Oswi/, Bishop of Lindisfarnc) fifty  Hides of land (a Hide,f a, lAonghdand, or a Carue, I hold  clearly equivalent) towards foundation of a Monastery.

And {through his Rule) the Church from Taxes stronghj   freed.   Ethelbald King of Mercland, Founder of Croidand Abbey  in Lincolnshire, a great, martial, and religious Prince, in a  Synod held (Cuthbcrt then Archbishop of Canterbury) en-  larged Ecclesiastic liberty in this form, Donationem meam me  vivente concedo, ut omnia Momisteria et Ecclesice Regni mei a  publicis Vectigalibus, Operibus, et Omribus absolvantur, nisi In-  structionibus Arcium vel Pontium, quce minquam tdli possunt  relaxari ; «.g.. He discharged all Monasteries and Churches  of all kind of taxes, works, and imposts, excepting such as  were for building of Forts and Bridges, being (as it seems the  law was then) not releasable. For, beside the authority of  this Statute of Ethelbald, it appears frequent in Charters of  the Saxon times, that, upon Endowment, and Donations, to  Churches with largest words of exemption, and liberty fi'om  all secular charges, the conclusion of the Ilahenduin, was,  Exceptis istis tribus, Expeditione, Pontis, Arcisve const ructionc*  which among common Notaries or Scriveners was so Avell  known, that they called it by one general name, Trinoda  Necessitas,f as out of Cedwalla's Charter to Wilfrid, first  Bishop of Selsey,^ of the ]\Ianor oiPagenham (now Paghani)   * Excepting those three, Aid in war, meniling of Bridges .in;l  Forts, vid.

Oswald in Yorkshire,  containing words of immunity and liberty of tenure, as  general and effectual as might be, a great lawyer^ long  since affirmed that yet the House was not freed of repairing  Bridges and Causies. But all lands, as well in hands of  Clerks as Lay, were subjected to particular tenures after  the Conquest : and so these kind of charges and discharges  being made rather feodal (as Bradoii* calls them) than ^^cr-  sonal, use of them in Charters consequently ceased. I note  here to students of antiquity, that, where the printed In-  gulph says this was done by Ethclhald in the third year of  his reign, they must with correction make it the twenty-  tliird,'^ as is, without scruple, apparant in the date of the  Synod,''^ which was 745 of our Saviour.

Perhaps as good authority may be given against some of  my proposed Chronology, as I can justify myself with. But  although so, yet I am therefore freed of error, because our  old Monks exceedingly in this kind corrupted, or deficient,  afford nothing able to rectify. I know the Fast-Angles, by  both ancient and later authority, begin above one hundred  years before; but if with synchronism you examine it, it will  be found most absurd. For, seeing it is affirmed expressly,  that Redwald was slain by EtheJfrkl King of Noi-ikumherkmd,  and being plain by Bede^ (take his story together, and rely  not upon syllables and false printed copies) that it must  needs be near 600 (for Fdivin succeeded Mhelfrid) and that  Uffa was some thirty years before : what calculation will  cast this into less than five hundred years after Christ?  Forget not (if you desire accurate times) my admonition to  the Fourth Song, of the twenty-two years' error upon the  Dionysian account, especially in the beginning of the King-  doms, because they are for the most part reckoned in old  Monks from the coming of the Saxons. Where you find  different names from these, attribute it to misreading old  copies, by such as have published Carpemrald for Eorpen-  wald, or EarpwaJd ; Penda also perhaps for Wcnda, mis-  taking the Saxon p. for our P. and other such, variably both  written and printed.

But know here, that although  Seven were, yet but Five had any long continuance of their  supremacies :   Wit ^a):ons tho in thtr jjotocr (tiio thtt faocre so rtuc)  ^tvit Hingtlomes matte iw Engelonde auli suthc* but biuf,  Ehe Iting of Northomberlond, anlJ oE Eastangle also  ®f Kent anU o!

Of famous Cambridge first     About the year 630, Sigehert (after death of Eorjnvnld)  returning out of France, whither his father Bedivald had  banished him, and receiving the East-angle Crown, assisted  by Fidlx a Bnrgognone, and first Bishop of Dunmch (then  called Dunmoc) in Suffolk, desiring to imitate what he had  seen observable in France, for the common good, Inst it nit  scholaiii (read it scholas, if you will, as some do, I see no   * Afterward,   + You could not so easily persuade them to husbandry, as to mar-  tial conllii't ; nor thought they it better than slothful, to get that by  swuftt whiyh they miyht have by blood.     106 POLY-OLBION,   consequence of worth) in qua pueri Uteris erudlrejitur* as  Ilede writeth. Out of these words thus general, Cambridge,  being in Uasiangle, hath been taken for this School, and the  School for the University, I will believe it (in so much as  makes it then a University) not much sooner than that (I  know not what) Gurgimtius with Cantaber, some hundred  and fifty years before Christ, founded it ; or, those Charters  of King Art/mr, Bulls of Pope Honorius and Sergius sent  thither, Anaximander or Anaxagoras their studies there,  with more such pretended and absurd unlikelihoods; unless  every Grammar School be an University, as this was, where  children were taught by Pcedagogi et Magistrijuxta morem Can-  tuarioriim,f as Bede hath expressly: which so makes Canter-  hunj an University also. But neither is there any touch in  authentic and ancient story, which justifies these Schools in-  stituted at Cambiidge, but generally somewhere in Eastangle.  Reasons of inducement are framed in multitudes on both  sides. But, for my own part, I never saw aily sufficiently  probable, and therefore most of all rely upon what authori-  ties are afforded. Among them I ever preferred the Ap-  pendix to the Story of Cruivland supposed done by Peter of  Blols, affirming that under Hen. I. (he lived very near the  same time ; therefore believe him in a matter not subject to  causes of Historians temporizing) Joffred Abbot of Crowland,  with one Gilbert his commoigne, and three other Monks,  came to his Manor of Catenham, as they used oft-times, to  read; and thence daily going to Cambridge, Condudo quodam  horreo publico suas scientias pallim projitcntes, in brevi iemporis  excursu grundem discipidorum numerum contraxerunt.

If  before this there were an University, I imagine that in it  was not professed Aristotle s Ethics, which tell us ts^/ r^c  SivixTii &lt;piXiag : for, then would they not have permitted  learned readers of the Sciences (whom all that hated not  the Muses could not but love) to be compelled into a Barn,  instead of Schools. Nor is it tolerable in conceit, that for  near five hundred years (which interceded twixt this and  Sigebert) no fitter place of profession should be erected. To  this time others have referred the beginning of that famous  Seminary of good literature : and, if room be left for me, I  offer subscription ; but always under reformation of that  most honoured Tutress's pupils, which shall (omitting fabu-  lous trash) judiciously instruct otherwise. But the Author  here out of Polydore, Leland, and others of later time relying  upon conjecture, hath his warrant of better credit than Can-  tilap, another relater of that Arcadian Original, which some  have so violently patronized.   403. Renowned Oxford hiiilt t' Apollo's learned brood.   So is it affirmed (of that learned King yet knowing not a  letter until he was past twelve) by Polydore, Bale, and  others ; grounding themselves upon what Alfred's benefi-  cence and most deserving care hath manifested in Eoyal  provision for that sacred Nourice of Learning. But justly  it may be doubted, lest they took instauration of what was  deficient, for institution : for although you grant that he  first founded University College; yet it follows not, but there  might be common Schools, and Colleges, as at this day in  Leyden, Gicsse, and other places of High and Low Germany.  If you please, fetch hither that of Greckiade (to the Third   * Hired a barn to read in, and so continued, till the number of  tlieir fcicliolars exceeded the content of that, or any Church.     108 POLY-OLBION,   Song) which I will not importune you to believe: but with-  out scruple you cannot but credit that of a Monk of S.  Dewi's^ (made Grammar and Rhetoric Reader there by  King Alfred) in these words of the year 886. -JSxorta est  pessima-ac teterrima Oxonue discordia inter Grimboldunt (this  was a great and devout Scholar, whose aid Alfred used in  his disposition of Lectures) doctisdmosqiie illos viros secum  illuc adduxit, et veteres illos scholasticos quos ibidem invenisset :  qui eius adventu, leges, modos, ac prcelegendi formulas ah eodem  Grimboldo institutas, omni ex parte ampledi recumbant.

But because in those remote  ages, not only Universities and Public Schools (being for a  time prohibited by Pope Gregory^ for fear of breeding Pelor  gians and Ar'ians) but divers Monasteries and Cloisters  were great Auditories of learning, as appears in Theodor and  Adrian's professing at Canterbury,^ Maldidjjh and Aldelm at  Malmeshury (this Aldelm first taught the Unglish to write  Latin prose and verse) Alcuin at Yorhe, Bede at Jarrov;^  and such other more I guess that hence came much obscu-  rity to their name, omitted or suppressed by envious Monks  of those times, than whose traditions descending through  many hands of their like, we have no credible authorities.

For  this division of Countries : how many he made, I know not,  but Malmeshury, under Ethelred, affirms, there were thirty-  two (Robert of Glocester thirty-five) about which time JVin-  chelcomb was one,^ but then joined to Glocester shire : those  thirty-two- were   Kent, Sussex, Surrey, Hantshire, Berkshire, Wiltshire, Somer-  set, Dorset, Devonshire. — Nine, governed by the JVest-Saxon  law.

But the two first received their division, as it  seems, before the Conquest ; for Cumherland had its par-  ticular ] 'governors,^ and Northumherlandr Earls: Westmer-  land perhaps began when King John gave it Robert Vipont,  ancestor to the Cliffords, holding by that Patent to this day  the inheritance of the Sheriffdom. Durham religiously was  with large immunities given to the Bishop, since the Nor-  77ian invasion. Lancaster, until Hen. III. created his younger  son Edmund CrooTce-hacke Earl of it, I think, was no County :  for, in one of our old Year-Books^ a learned Judge affirms,  that, in this Henry's time, was the first Sheriff's Tourne  held there. Nor until Edward (first son to Edmund of  Langh'i/ Duke of Yorke, and afterward Duke of Aumerle)  created by Rich. II. had Rutland any Earls. I know for  number and time of those, all authority agrees not with  me ; but I conjecture only upon selected. As Alured  divided the Shires first ; so to him is owing the Constitu-  tion of Hundreds, Tithings, Lathes, and Wapentakes, to the  end that whosoever were not lawfully, upon credit of his  Boroughes, i.e., pledges, admitted in some of them for a good  subject, should be reckoned as suspicious of life and loyalty.

When most they were upheld with all the Eastern might, no  More Towns and Cities built out of her wealth and power.  Than all their hostile flames could any way devour.  And, when the Danish here the Country most destroy'd,  Yet all our powers on them not wholly were employ'd;  But some we still reserv'd abroad for us to roam, 115   To fetch in foreign spoils, to help our loss at home.  And all the Land, from us, they never clearly wan :  But to his endless praise, our English Athelstan,  In the Northumbrian fields, with most victorious might  Put Alaffe and his powers to more inglorious flight ; 120  And more than any King of th' English him before,  Each way from North to South, from West to th' Eastern   shore,  Made all the Isle his own ; his seat who firmly fixt,  The Galidonian Hills and Cathnes point betwixt,  § And Constantine their King (a prisoner) hither brought ; 125  Then over Severne's banks the warlike Britans fought :  Where he their Princes forc'd from that their strong retreat,  In England to appear at his Imperial seat.   But after, when the Danes, who never wearied were,  Came with intent to make a general conquest here, iso   They brought with them a man deem'd of so wond'rous   might,  As was not to be match'd by any mortal wight :  For, one could scarcely bear his axe into the field ;     120 POLF-OLBIOiV,   Which as a little wand the Dane would lightly wield :   And (to enforce that strength) of such a dauntless spirit, 135   A man (in their conceit) of so exceeding merit,   That to the Englhli oft they ofFer'd him (in pride)   The ending of the war by combat to decide :   Much scandal which procur'd unto the English name.   When, some out of their love, and some spurr'd on with   shame, i4o   By envy some provok'd, some out of courage, fain  Would undertake the cause to combat with the Dane.  But Athelstan the while, in settled judgment found,  Should the Defendant fail, how wide and deep a wound  It likely was to leave to his defensive war. 145   Thus, whilst with sundry doubts his thoughts perplexed   are.  It pleas'd all-powerful Heaven, that Warwick's famous Guy  (The knight through all the world renown'd for chivalry)  Arriv'd from foreign parts, where he had held him long.  His honourable arms devoutly having hong 150   In a Religious house, the off 'rings of his jjraise,  To his Redeemer Christ, his help at all assays  (Those Arms, by whose strong proof he many a Christian   freed,  And bore the perfect marks of many a worthy deed)  Himself, a palmer poor, in homely russet clad 155   (And only in his hand his hermit's staff he had)  Tow'rds IFinchestcr alone (so) sadly took his way,  Where Athelstan, that time the King of England lay ;  And where the Danish Camp then strongly did abide,  Near to a goodly mead, wliich men there call the Hide, loo   The day that fhiij arriv'd (when silent night did bring  Sleep both on friend and foe) that most rcdigious King  (Whose strong and constant heart, all grievous cares sup-   prest)     THE TTVELFTH SONG. ]21   His due devotion done, betook himself to rest.   To whom it seem'd by night an Angel did appear, ig5   Sent to him from that God Whom he invok'd by pray'r ;   Commanding him the time not idly to forslow,   But rathe as he could rise, to such a gate to go.   Whereas he should not fail to find a goodly knight   In palmer's poor attire : though very meanly dight, 170   Yet by his comely shape, and limbs exceeding strong,   He eas'ly might him know the other folk among ;   And bad him not to fear, but choose him for the man.   No sooner brake the day, but uprose Athelstan ;  And as the Vision show'd, he such a palmer found, irs   With others of his sort, there sitting on the ground :  Where, for some poor repast they only seem'd to stay,  Else ready to depart each one upon his way :  When secretly the King revealed to the knight  His comfortable dreams that lately-passed night : iso   With mild and princely words bespeaking him ; quoth he,  Far better you are known to Heaven (it seems) than me  For this great action fit : by Whose most dread command  (Before a world of men) it's lay'd upon your hand.  Then stout and valiant knight, here to my court repair, iss  Refresh you in my baths, and mollify your care  With comfortable wines and meats what you will ask :  And choose my richest arms to fit you for this task.   The palmer (grey with age) with countenance lowting low.  His head even to tlie earth before the King doth bow, mo  Him softly answering thus ; Dread Lord, it fits me ill  (A wretched man) t' oppose high Heaven's eternal will :  Yet my most sovereign Liege, no more of me esteem  Than this poor habit shows, a pilgrim as I seem ;  But yet 1 must confess, have seen in former days 195   The best knights of the world, and scuffled in some frays.  Those times are gone with me ; and, being aged now,     122 POLY-OLBION,   Have off 'red np my arms, to Heaven and made my vow   Ke'er more to bear a shield, nor my declining age   (Except some palmer's tent, or homely hermitage) 200   Shall ever enter roof : but if, by Heaven and thee,   This action be impos'd great English King on me,   Send to the Danish Camp, their challenge to accept,   In some convenient place proclaiming it be kept :   Where, by th' Almighty's power, for England I'll appear. 205   The King, much pleas'd in mind, assumes his wonted  cheer.  And to the Danish power his choicest herault sent. .  When, both through camp and court, this combat quickly   went.  Which suddenly divulg'd, whilst every list'ning ear,  As thirsting after news, desirous was to hear, 210   Who for the English side durst undertake the day ;  The puissant Kings accord, that in the middle way  Betwixt the tent and town, to either's equal sight,  Within a goodly mead, most fit for such a fight.  The Lists should be prepar'd for this material prize. 215   The day prefixt once com'n, both Dune and English rise,  And to th' appointed place th' unnumb'red people throng :  The weaker female sex, old men, and children young.  Into the windows get, and up on stalls, to see  The man on whose brave hand their hope that day must be.  In noting of it well, there might a man behold 221   More sundry forms of fear than thought imagine could.  One looks upon his friend with sad and heavy chear,  Who seems in this distress a part with him to bear :  Their passions do express much pity mixt with rage. 225  Whilst one his wife's laments is labouring to assuage,  His little infant near, in childish gibbri(lg(&gt; shows  AV' hat addeth to his grief who sought to calm her woes.  One having climb'd some roof, the concourse to descry,     THE TIVELFTH SONG. 123   From thence upon the earth directs his humble eye, 230   As since he thither came he suddenly had found   Some danger them amongst which lurk'd upon the ground.   One stands with fix6d eyes, as though he were aghast :   Another sadly comes, as though his hopes were past.   This hark'neth with his friend, as though with him to break   Of some intended act. Whilst they together speak, 236   Another standeth near to listen what they say,   Or what should be the end of this so doubtful day.   One great and general face the gathered people seem :   So that the perfect'st fight beholding could not deem 2W   What looks most sorrow show'd ; their griefs so equal were.   Upon the heads of two, whose cheeks were join'd so near   As if togetJier grown, a third his chin doth rest :   Another looks o'er his : and others, hardly prest;   Look'd underneath their arms. Thus, whilst in crowds   they throng 245   (Led by the King himself) the Champion comes along;  A man well-strook in years, in homely palmer's gray.  And in his hand his staff, his reverend steps to stay.  Holding a comely pace : which at his passing by.  In every censuring tongue, as every serious eye, 250   Compassion mixt with fear, distrust and courage bred.   Then Colehrond for the Danes came forth in ireful red ;  Before him (from the camp) an ensign first display'd  Amidst a guard of gleaves : then sumptuously array'd  Were twenty gallant youths, that to the warlike sound 255  Of Danish brazen drums, with many a lofty bound.  Come with their Country's march, as they to Mars should   dance.  Thus, forward to the fight, both Champions them advance :  And each without respect doth resolutely chuse  The weapon that he brought, nor doth his foe's refuse. 200  The Dane prepares his axe, that pond'rous was to feel,     124 POLY-OLBIOX,   '\Miose squares were laid with plates, and riveted with steel,  And armed down along with pikes ; whose hard'ned points  (Forc'd \rith the weapon's weight) had power to tear the   joints  Of curass or of mail, or whatsoe'er they took : 255   Which caus'd him at the knight disdainfully to look.   When our stout palmer soon (unknown for valiant Gui/)  The cord from his straight loins doth presently untie,  Puts off his palmer's weed unto his truss, which bore  The stains of ancient arms, but show'd it had before 270  Been costl}^ cloth of gold ; and off his hood he threw :  Out of his hermit's staff his two-hand sword he drew  (The unsuspected sheath which long to it had been)  Which till that instant time the people had not seen ;  A sword so often try'd. Then to himself, quoth he, 275  Arms let me crave your aid, to set my Country free :  And never shall my heart your help again require,  But only to my God to lift you up in pray'r.   Here, Cohbrond forward made, and soon the Christian  knight  Encounters him again with equal power and spight : 2so  Whereas, betwixt them two, might eas'ly have been seen  Such blows, in public throng as us6d had they been,  Of many there the least might many men have slain :  Which none but they could strike, nor none but they sustain ;  The most relentless eye that had the power to awe, 2j55   And so great wonder breil in those the fight that saw,  As verily they thought, that Nature until then  Had purposely reserv'd the utmost power of men.  Where strength still answer'd strength, on courage courage  grew.   Look how two lions fierce, both hungry, both pursue 290  One sweet and selfsame prey, at one another fly,  And with their armed paws ingrappled dreadfully.     THE TWELFTH SONG, 125   The thunder of tlieir rage, and boist'rous struggling, make  The neighbouring forests round affrightedly to quake :  Then- sad encounter, such. The mighty Cokbrond stroke 295  A cruel blow at Gay : which though he finely broke,  Yet (with the weapon's weight) his ancient hilt it split,  And (thereby lessened much) the Champion lightly hit  Upon the reverent brow : immediately from whence  Tlie Ijlood dropp'd softly down, as if the wound had sense 300  Of their much inward woe that it with grief should see.  The Danes, a deadly blow supposing it to be.  Sent such an echoing shout that rent the troubled air.  The English, at the noise, wax'd all so wan with fear,  As though they lost the blood their agt'd Champion shed :  Yet were not these so pale, but th' other were as red ; 306  As though the blood that fell, upon their cheeks had stay'd.   Here Guy, his better spirits recalling to his aid,  Came fresh upon his foe ; when mighty Cokbrond makes  Another desperate stroke : which Guy of IFarwkk takes 310  Undauntedly aloft ; and follow'd with a blow  Upon his shorter ribs, that the excessive flow  Streatn'd up unto his hilts : the wound so gap'd withall.  As though it meant to say, ' Behold your Champion's fall  By this proud palmer's hand.' Such claps again and cries 315  The joyful English gave as cleft the very skies.  Which coming on along from these that were without.  When those within the town receiv'd this cheerful shout.  They answer'd them with like; as those their joy that knew.  Then with such eager blows each other they pursue, 320  As every offer miide should threaten imminent death ;  Until, through heat and toil both hardly drawing breath,  They desperately do close. Look how two boars, being set  Together side to side, their threat'ning tusks do whet,  And with their gnashing teeth their angry foam do bite, 325  Whilst still they should'ring seek, each other where to smite :     126 POLY-OLBION,   Thus stood those ireful knights ; till flying back, at length  The palmer, of the two the first recovering strength,  Upon the left arm lent great Colebrond such a wound,  That whilst his weapon's point fell well-near to the ground,  And slowly he it rais'd, the valiant Guy again 331   Sent through his cloven scalp his blade into his brain.  When downward went his head, and up his heels he threw ;  As wanting hands to bid his Countrymen adieu.   The English part, which thought an end he would have   made, 335   And seeming as they much would in his praise have said,  He bade them yet forbear, whilst he pursu'd his fame  That to this passed King next in succession came ;  That great and puissant knight (in whose victorious days  Those knight-like deeds were done, no less deserving praise)  Brave Edmond^ JEdioard's son, that Stafford having ta'en, 341  With as successful speed won Darhy from the Dane.  From Lester then again, and Lincoln at the length,  Drave out the Dacian Powers by his resistless strength :  And this his England clear'd beyond that raging Flood,* 345  Which that proud King of Ilunnes once christ'ned with his   blood.  By which, great Edmond's power apparantly was shown.  The Land from Uumher South recovering for his own ;  That Edgar after him so much disdain'd the Dane  Unworthy of a war that should disturb his reign, sso   As generally he seem'd regardless of their hate.  And studying every way magnificence in State,  At Chester whilst he liv'd at more than kingly charge,  Eight tributary Kings^ there row'd him in his barge :  His shores from pirates' sack the King that strongly   kept : 355   § A Ncjdune, whose proud sails the British Ocean swept.   * Uumher, ' See to the Tenth Song.     THE TIVELFTH SONG. 127   But after his decease, when his more hopeful son,  § By cruel stepdame's hate, to death was lastly done,  To set his rightful Crown upon a wrongful head  (When by thy fatal curse, licentious Etheldred, 860   Through dissoluteness, sloth, and thy abhorred life,  As grievous were thy sins, so were thy sorrows rife)  The Dane, possessing all, the English forc'd to bear  A heavier yoke than first those heathen slaveries were ;  Subjected, bought, and sold, in that most Avretched plight, 365  As even their thi-aldom seem'd their neighbours to affright.  Yet could not all their plagues the English height abate :  But even in their low'st ebb, and miserablest state,  Courageously themselves they into action put,  § And in one night, the throats of all the Danish cut. 37o   And when in their revenge, the most insatiate Dane  Unshipp'd them ou our shores, under their puissant Swane :  And swoll'n with hate and ire, their huge unwieldy force,  Came clust'ring like the Greeks out of the Wooden-horse :  And the Norfolcian towns, the near'st unto the East, 376  With sacrilege and rape did terriblest infest ;  Those Danes yet from the shores we with such violence drave.  That from our swords, their sliips could them but hardly save.  And to renew the war, that year ensuing, when  With fit supplies for spoil, they landed here again, sso   And all the Southern shores from Kent to Cornwall spread,  With those disord'red troops by Alaffe luther led,  In seconding their Swane, which cry'd to them for aid ;  Their multitudes so much sad Ethelred dismay'd.  As from his Country forc'd the wretched King to fly, 3S5  An English yet there was, when England seem'd to lie  Under the heaviest yoke that ever kingdom bore,  Who wash'd his secret knife in Stvane's relentless gore,  Whilst (swelling in excess) his lavish cups he ply'd.  Such means t' redeem themselves th' afliicted Nation try'd.     128 POLY-OLBION,   And when courageous Knute, th' late murther'd Swaniis^ son,  Came in t' revenge that act on his great father done, 392  He found so rare a spirit that here against him rose.  As though ordain'd by Heaven his greatness to oppose :  Who Avith him foot to foot, and face to face durst stand. 395  When Knute, which here alone affected the command,  The Crown upon his head at fair South-hampton set :  And Edniond, loth to lose what Knute desir'd to get.  At London caus'd himself inaugurate to be.  King Knute Avould conquer all, King Edmond would be free.  The Kingdom is the prize for which they both are prest :  And with their equal powers both meeting in the West, 402  The green Dorsetian fields a deep vermilion dy'd :  AYhere GilUngham gave way to their great hosts (in pride)  Abundantly their blood that each on other spent. 405   But Edmond, on whose side that day the better went  (And with like fortune thought the remnant to suppress  That Sarum then besieg'd, which was in great distress)  With his victorious troops to Scdhhurij retires :  When with fresh bleeding wounds, Knute, as with fresh   desires, 410   Whose might though somewhat maim'd, his mind yet un-   subdu'd,  His lately conquering Foe courageously pursu'd :  And finding out a way, sent to his friends with speed,  '\^'llo him supply 'd with aid : and being help'd at need,  Ti;mpts Edmond still to fight, still ho})ing for a day. 415   Towards JVwstershire their powers both well upon their way,  There, falling to the field, in a continual fight  Two days the angry hosts still parted were l)y night :  AVhere twice the rising sun, and twice the setting, saw  Them with their equal wounds their wearied breath to draw.  Great London to surprise, then (next) Cnnutas makes : 421  And thitherward as fast King Edmond Iromide takes.     THE TJVELFTH SONQ. 129   \^niilst Kmde set down his siege before the Eastern gate,  King Edmond through the West pass'd in triumphal state.  But this courageous King, that scorned, in his pride, 425  A town should be besieg'd wherein he did abide,  Into the fields again the valiant Edmond goes.  Kanutus, yet that hopes to win what he did lose,  Provokes him still to fight : and falling back where they  Might field-roorath find at large, their ensigns to display, 430  Together flew again : that Brentford, with tlie blood  Of Danes and English mix'd, discolour'd long time stood,  Yet Edmond, as before, went victor still away.   When soon that valiant Knute, whom nothing could dismay,  Recall'd his scatter'd troops, and into Essex hies, 435   Where (as ill-fortune would) the Dane with fresh supplies  Was lately come a-land, to whom brave Ironside makes ;  But Knute to him again as soon fresh courage takes :  And Fortune (as herself) determining to show  That she could bring an ebb on valiant EdmomTs flow, 440  And eas'ly cast him down from off' the top of chance.  By turning of her wheel, Canutus doth advance.  Where she beheld that Prince which she had favour'd long  (Even in her proud despite) his murther'd troops among  With sweat and blood besmear'd (Dukes, Earls, and Bishops  slain, 445   In that most dreadful day, when all went to the Dane)  Through worlds of dangers wade ; and with his sword and   shield.  Such wonders there to act as made her in the Field  Ashamed of herself, so brave a spirit as he  By her unconstant hand should so much wrong6d be. 450   But, having lost the day, to Glocester he draws,  To raise a second power in his slain soldiers' cause.  When late-encourag'd Knute, whilst fortune yet doth last,  Who oft from Ironside fled, now follow 'd him as fast.   VOL.

With tbreat'ning swords still drawn; and with obnoxious   hands  Attending their revenge, whilst either enemy stands.  One man amongst the rest from this confusion breaks.

THE TWELFTH SONG. 131   Camdus, of the two that furthest was from hope,  Who found with what a foe his fortune was to cope,  Cries, ' Noble Edmoml, hold ; Let us the Land divide.'  Here th' English and the Danes, from either equal side 490  Were echoes to his words, and all aloud do cry,  ' Courageous Kings divide ; 'twere pity such should die.'   When now the neighbouring Floods will'd IVrehin to  suppress  His style, or they were like to surfeit with excess.  And time had brought about, that now they all began 495  To listen to a long-told prophecy, Avhich ran  Of Mordaml, that she might live prosperously to see  A River born of her, who well might reckon'd be  The third of this large Isle : which saw did first arise  From Arden, in those days delivering prophecies. 500   The Druids (as some say) by her instructed were.  In many secret skills she had been conn'd her lere.  The ledden of the birds most perfectly she knew :  And also from their flight strange auguries she dreAV ;  Supremest in her place : whose circuit was extent 505   From Avon to the banks of Severne and to Trent :  AVhere Empress-like she sat with Nature's bounties blest,  And serv'd by many a Nymph ; but two, of all the rest.  That StaffordsJiire calls hers, there both of high account.  The eld'st of which is Canke : though Needwood her sur-  mount, 510  In excellence of soil, by being richly plac'd  Twixt Trent and batniug Dove ; and, equally imbrac'd  By their abounding banks, participates their store ;  Of Britain's Forests all (from th' less unto the more)  For fineness of her turf surpassing ; and doth beai- sis  Her curled head so high, that Forests far and near  Oft grutch at her estate ; her flourishing to see,  Of all their stately tires disrobed when they be.   9-ii     132 POLY-OLBION,   But (as the world goes now) o woful Canlce the ■while,  As brave a Wood-Xympli once as any of tliis Isle ; 520   Great Arden's eldest child : which, in her mother's ground  Before fair Feck'nham's self, her old age might have crown'd ;  When as those fallow deer, and huge-hanch'd stags that graz'd  Upon her shaggy heaths, the passenger amaz'd 524   To see their mighty herds, with high-palm'd heads to threat  The woods of o'ergrown oaks ; as though they meant to set  Their horns to th' others' heights. But now, both those   and these  Are by vile gain devour'd : So abject are our days.  She now, unlike herself, a neatherd's life doth live,  And her dejected mind to country cares doth give. 530   But Muse, thou seem'st to leave the Morelands too too long :  Of whom report may speak (our mighty wastes among)  She from her chilly site, as from her barren feed,  For body, horn, and hair, as fair a beast doth breed  As scarcely this great Isle can equal : then of her, 535   Why should'st thou all this while the prophecy defer?  Who beariug many springs, Avhich pretty Eivers grew,  She could not be content, until she fully knew  Which child it was of hers (born under such a fate)  As should in time be rais'd unto that high estate. 540   (I fain would have you think, that this was long ago,  When many a River, now tliat furiously doth flow,  Had scurciily learu'd to creep) and therefore she doth will  Wise Arden, from the depth of her abundant skill.

This, Moreland greatly lik'd : yet in that tender love, 555  Which she had ever borne unto her darling Dove,  She could have wish'd it his : because the dainty grass  That grows upon his bank, all other doth surpass.  But, subject he must be : as Sow, which from her spring,  At Stafford meeteth Penh, which she along doth bring 560  To Trent by Tixall grac'd, the Astons' aiicient seat ;  JFhich oft the Miise hath found her safe and sweet retreat.  The nolle owners now of which helovkl place,  Good fortunes them and theirs ivith honoured titles grace:  May Heaven still bless that House, till happy Floods you see 565  Yourselves more grac'd by it, than it by you can be.  Whose bounty still my Muse so freely shall confess.  As when she shall ivant tvords, her signs shall it express.   So Blyth bears eas'ly down tow'rds her dear Sovereign   Trent :  But nothing in the world gives Moreland such content 570  As her own darling Dove his confluence to behold  Of Floods in sundry strains : as, crankling Manyfold  The first that lends him force : of whose meand'red ways.  And labyrinth-like turns (as in the moors she strays)  She first receiv'd her name, by growing strangely mad, 575  O'ergone with love of Hanse, a dapper moorland lad.  Who near their crystal springs as in those wastes they   play'd,  Bewitch'd the wanton heart of that delicious maid :  Which instantly was turn'd so much from being coy,  That she might seem to dote upon the moorish boy. 580   Who closely stole away (perceiving her intent)  With his dear lord the Dove, in quest of princely Treiit,     134 POLY-OLBION.   With many other Floods (as, Churnei, in his train   Tliat draweth Dunsmm-e on, with Yendon, then clear Taine,   That comes alone to Dove) of which, Ilanse one would be. 5S5   And for himself he fain of Many-fold would free   Thinking this amorous Nymph by some means to beguile)   He closely under earth conveys his head awhile.   But, when the River fears some policy of his,   And her beloved Ilanse immediately doth miss, 590   Distracted in her course, improvidently rash,   She oft against the cleeves her crystal front doth dash :   Now forward, then again she backward seems to bear ;   As, like to lose herself by straggling here and there.   Eanse, that this while suppos'd him quite out of her sight,  No sooner thrusts his head into the cheerful light, 596   But Many-fold that still the runaway doth watch.  Him (ere he was aware) about the neck doth catch :  And, as the angry Eanse would lain her hold remove,  They ^-uggling tumble down into their lord, the Dove. 600   Thus though th' industrious Muse hath been imploy'd so  long.  Yet is she loth to do poor little Smesfall wrong.  That from her J I'll fume's spring near Hampton plies, to pour  The wealth she there receives, into her friendly Stoivr.

Ami into lesser streams the spacious Current cut.   In that raging devastation over this Kingdom by the  Danes, they had gotten divers of their ships fraught with  provision out of Thames into the river Ley (which divides  Middlesex and Essex) some twenty miles from London; Alfred  holding his tents near that territory, especially to prevent  their spoil of the instant harvest, observed that by dividing  the river, then navigable between them and Thames, their  ships would be grounded, and themselves bereft of what  confidence their navy had promised them. He thought it,  and did it, by parting the water into three channels. The  Danes betook themselves to flight, their ships left as a prey  to the Lotuloners.   120. Her lord's imbraces vow'd she never more would know.   This Alured left his son Edward successor, and, among  other children, this Eljled, or Ethcljled his daughter, married     136 POLY-OLBION,   to EtMred Earl of Merc-Jand. Of AlfrecTK worth and  troublous reign, because here the Author leaves him, I offer  you these of an ancient English wit :   NoUlitas innata tibl p-ohitatis honorem  Armipotens Alfrede dcdit, jyroMtasqiie lahorem  Peijjehmiivjiie labor nomen. Cui mixta dolori  Gcmdia semper- erant, spes semper mixta timori.  Si modo victor eras, ad crastina bella pavebas :  Si modo vidus eras, ad crastina bella parabas.  Cui vestes siidore jugi, cui sicca cruore  Tincta jugi, quantum sit amis regnare pirobdrunt.   Huntingdon cites these as his own ; and if he deal plainly  with us (I doubted it because his MS. epigrams, which  make in some copies the eleventh and twelfth of his History,  are of most different strain, and seem made when Apollo  was either angry, or had not leisure to overlook them) he  shows his Muse (as also in another written by him upon  Edgar, beginning Auctor opum, vindex scelerum, largitw hono-  rum, dc) in that still declining time of learning's state,  worthy of much precedence. Of Elliclfled in JFilliam of  3Ialmeshury, is the Latin of this English : She was the love of  the subject, fear of the enemy, a icoman of a mighty heart; having  once endured the grievous fains of child-birth, ever afterward  denied her husband those sweeter desires ; protesting, that, yield-  ing indulgence towards a pleasure, having so much consequent  pain, was unseemly in a King's daughter. She was buried at  S. Peter's in Glocester ; her name loaden by JNIonks with  numbers of her excellencies.   125. And Constantine their King, an hostage hither hronght.

Edward was  anointed King (for in those days was that use of Anointing  among the Saxon Princes,^ and began in King Alfred) but  not without disliking grudges of his stepmother's faction,  which had nevertheless in substance, what his vain name  only of King pretended : but her bloody hate, bred out of  womanish ambition, straining to every point of sovereignty,  not thus satisfied, compelled in her this cruelty.* King  Edicard not suspecting her dissembled purposes, with simple  kindness of an open nature, weaiied after the chase in Fur-  hedc Isle in Dorsetshire, without guard or attendance, visits  her at Corfe Castle; she, under sweet words and saluting  kisses, palliating her hellish design, entertains him : but  while he being very hot and thirsty (without imagination of  treason) was in pledging her, she, or one of her appointed  servantSjt stabbed the innocent King. His corpse, within  little space expiring its last breath, was buried at JVarham,  thence afterward by Alfer Earl of Merc-land, translated into  Shaftsbury, which (as to the Second Song I note) was hereby  for a time called S. Edivard's.^ Thus did his brother-in-law  Ethelred (according to wicked Elfrith's cruel and traitorous  project) succeed him. As, of Constantine Co^rronymm, the  Grech, so, of this Ethelred, is affirmed, that, in his holy  tincture he abused the Font with natural excrements, which  made S. Dunstan, then Christening him, angrily exclaim,  Per Deum et Matrem Ejus, ignanis homo crlt.X Some ten years  of age was he, when his brother Edward was slain, and, out  of childish affection, wept for him bitterly; which his  mother extremely disliking, being author of the murther   1 Anointefl Princes. * 078.   t Vide Malmesb. lib. 2. cap. 9. et Huntingdon.

Through many shapes the Muse here roves ;  Now sporting in those shady Groves,  The tunes of Birds oft stays to hear :  Then, finding herds of lusty Deer,  She huntress-like the Hart pursues ;  And like a Hermit walks, to chuse  The Simples ev'rywhere that grow ;  Comes Ancor's glory next to show ;  Tells Guy of Warwick's famous deeds;  To th' Vale of Red-horse then proceeds.  To play her part the rest among ;  There shutteth up her Thirteenth Song.

The gripple Avretch began immediately to spoil  My tall and goodly woods, and did my grounds inclose :  By which, in little time my bounds I came to lose.   When Britain first her fields with Villages had fill'd, 25   Her people wexing still, and wanting where to build,   They oft dislodg'd the hart, and set their houses, where   He in the broom and brakes had long time made his lair.   Of all the Forests here within this mighty Isle,   If those old Britans then me Sovereign did instyle, 30   I needs must be the great'st ; for greatness 'tis alone   That gives our kind the place : else were there many a one   For pleasantness of shade that far doth me excell.   But, of our Forests' kind the quality to tell,   We equally partake with wood-land as with plain, 35   Alike with hill and dale ; and every day maintain   * The ancient Coat of that Earldom.

Here Arden of herself ceas'd any more to show ;  And with her sylvan joys the Muse along doth go. 40   When Phcebm lifts bis liead out o-f the Winter's wave,  No sooner doth the earth her flowery bosom brave,  At such time as the year brings on the pleasant Spring,  But Hunts-up to the Morn the feath'red Sylvans sing :  And in the lower grove, as on the rising knole, 45   Upon the highest spray of every mounting pole,  Those Quiristers are perch'd with many a speckled breast.  Then from her burnish'd gate the goodly glitt'ring East  Gilds every lofty top, which late the humorous Night  Bespangled had with pearl, to please the Morning's sight : so  On which the mirthful Quires, with their clear open throats.  Unto the joyful j\Iorn so strain their warbling notes.  That hills and valleys ring, and even the echoing air  Seems all compos'd of sounds, about them everywhere.  The Throstell, with shrill shar[&gt;s ; as purposely he song 55  T' awake the lustless Sari ; or chiding, that so long  He was in coming forth, that should the thickets thrill :  The IFuosell near at hand, that hath a golden bill ;  As Nature him had mark'd of purpose, t' let us see  That from all other birds his tunes should different be : oo  For, with their vocal sounds, they sing to pleasant May ;  Upon his dulcet pipe the Merle doth only play.^  When in the lower brake, the Nir/htliigale hard-by.  In such lamenting strains the joyful hours doth ply,  As though the other birds she to her tunes would draw. 65  And, but that Nature (by her all-constraining law)  Each bird to her own kind this season doth invite.  They else, alone to hear that Charmer of the Niglit  (The more tO' use their ears) their voices sure would spare^  ^ Of all Birds, only the Biackbinl whistleth.

And of these chanting fowls, the Goldfinch not behind.  That hath so many sorts descending from her kind.  The Tijdie for her notes as delicate as they.  The laughing Hecco, then the counterfeiting Jay, so   The softer, with the shrill (some hid among the leaves,  Some in the taller trees, some in the lower greaves)  Thus sing away the Morn, until the mounting sun,  Through thick exhaled fogs, his golden head hath run,  And through the twisted tops of our close covert creeps 85  To kiss the gentle shade, this while that sweetly sleeps.   And near to these our thicks, the wild and frightful herds.

THE THIRTEENTH SONG. 149   Whereas tlie Hermit leads a sweet retired life,  From villages replete with ragg'd and sweating clowns, i65  And from the loathsome airs of smoky citied towns.  Suppose twixt noon and night, the sun his halfway wrought^  (The shadows to be large, by his descending brought)  Who with a fervent eye looks through the twyring glades,  And his dispersed rays commixeth with the shades, iro   Exhaling the milch dew, which there had tarried long,  And on the ranker grass till past the noon-sted hong ;  When as the Hermit comes out of his homely Cell,  Where from all rude resort he happily doth dv/ell •?■  Who in the strength of youtli, a man-at-arms hath been ; its  Or one who of this world the vileness having seen,  Retires him from it quite : and with a constant mind  Man's beastliness so loths, that flying human kind,  The black and darksome nights, the bright and gladsome days  Indiff' rent are to him, his hope on God that stays. iso   Each little village yields his short and homely fare :  To gather wind-faU'n sticks, his great'st and only care ;  Which every aged tree still yieldeth to his hre.  This man, that is alone a Kmg m his desire.  By no proud ignorant lord is basely over-aw'd, iss   Nor his false praise affects, who grossly being claw'd.  Stands like an itchy moyle ; nor of a pin he weighs  What fools, abused Kings, and humorous ladies raise.  His free and noble thought, ne'er envies at the grace  That often-times is given unto a bawd most base, 190   Nor stirs it him to think on the impostor vile,  Who seeming what he's not, doth sensually beguile  The sottish purblind world ; but absolutely free,  His happy time he spends the works of God to see,   ^ A description of the afternoon.   ^ Hermits liave oft had thuii- abodes byways that lie through  forests.     150 POLY-OLBION,   In those so sundry herbs which there in plenty grow : 195   Whose sundry strange effects he only seeks to know.   And in a little maund, being made of osiers small,   AVhich serveth him to do full many a thing withall,   He very choicely sorts his simples got abroad.   Here finds he on an oak rheum-purging Pdipode ; 200   And in some open place that to the sun doth lie,   He Fumitorie gets, and Ei/e -bright for the eye :   The Yarroio, wherewithal he stops the wound-made gore :   The healing Tutsan then, and Plantan for a sore.   And hard by them again he holy Vervaiiie finds, 205   Which he about his head that hath the megrim binds.   The wonder-working Dill he gets not far from these,   Which curious women use in many a nice disease.   For them that are with newts, or snakes, or adders stong.   He seeketh out an herb that's called Adders-tong ; 210   As Nature it ordain'd, its own like hurt to cure,   And sportive did herself to niceties inure.   Valerian then he crops, and purposely doth stamp,   T' apply unto the place that's ailed with the cramp.   As Centurij, to close the wideness of a wound : 215   The belly hurt by birth, by Mugwort to make sound.   His Chkhvced cures the heat that in the face doth rise.   For physick, some again he inwardly ai)plies.  For comforting the spleen and liver, gets for juice.  Pale Ilnre-houud, which he holds of most esjjecial use. 220  So Saxifrage is good, and Hart's-tmgm for the stone,  With ylgrlmoinj, and that herb we call S. John.  To him that hath a flux, of Shepherd' s-parse he gives ;  And Mouse-ear unto him whom some sharp rupture grieves.  And for the labouring wretch that's troubled with a cough,  Or stopping of the breath, by fleagm that's hard and tough,  Campaiia here lie crops, approved wondrous good : 227   As Comfreij unto him that's bruised, spitting blood ;     THE THIRTEENTH SONG. 151   And from the falling-ill, by Five-leaf doth restore ;   And melancholy cures by sovereign Hellebore. 230   Of these most helpful herbs yet tell we but a few,  To those unnumb'red sorts of simples here that grew.  Which justly to set down, even Bodon^ short doth fall ;  Nor skilful Gerard,^ yet, shall ever find them all.   But from our Hermit here the Muse we must inforce, 235  And zealously proceed in our intended course :  How Arden of her Rills and Riverets doth dispose ;  By Alcesier how Aim to Ari'o eas'ly flows ;  And mildly being mix'd, to Avon hold their way :  And likewise tow'rd the Xorth, how lively-tripping Bhsa, 240  T' attend the lustier Tame, is from her fountain sent :  So little Cole and Bhjtli go on with him to Trent.  His Tamivorth at the last, he in his way doth win :  There playing him awhile, till Ancor should come in,  Which trifleth 'twixt her banks, observing state, so slow, 245  As thou2;h into his arms she scorn'd herself to throw :  Yet Arden will'd her Tame to serve her* on his knee ;.  For by that Nymph alone, they both should honour'd be.  The Forest so much fall'n from what she was before,  That to her former height Fate could her not restore j 250  Though oft in her behalf, the Genius of the Land  Importunt^d the Heavens with an auspicious hand.  Yet granted at the last (the aged Nymph to grace)  They by a Lady's birth would more renown that place  Than if her Woods their heads above the Hills should seat ;  And for that purpose, first made Coventry so great 256   (A poor thatch'd village then, or scarcely none at all.  That could not once have dream'd of her now stately wall),  § And thither wisely brought that goodly Virgin-band,  Th' Eleven thousand maids, chaste Ursuhis Command, 26O  Whom then the Britan Kings gave her full power to press,   ^ The Authors of two famous Herbals. * Ancor,     152 FOLY-OLBION,   For matches to their friends in Brittany the less.   At whose departure thence, each by her just bequest   Some special virtue gave, ordaining it to rest   AVith one of their own sex, that there her birth should have,   Till fulness of the time which Fate did choicely save ; 2G6   Until the Saxons' reign, when Coventry at length,   From her small mean regard, recovered state and strength,   § By Lcofric her Lord yet in base bondage held,   The people from her marts by tollage who expell'd : 270   Whose Duchess, which desir'd this tribute to release.   Their freedom often begg'd. The Duke, to make her cease,   Told her that if she would his loss so far inforce,   His will was, she should ride stark nak'd upon a horse   By daylight through the street : which certainly he thought.   In her heroic breast so deeply would have wrought, 270   That in her former suit she would have left to deal.   But that most princely Dame, as one devour'd with zeal,   AVent on, and by that mean the City clearly freed.   The first jmrt of whose name, Godiva, doth foreread 280   Th' first syllable of hers, and Goodere half doth soimd;  For by agreeing tvm-ds, great matters have been found.  But further than this place the mystery extends.  JVhat Arden hud begun, in Ancor lastly ends :  For in the British tongue, the Britans could not find, zss   Wherefore to her that name of Ancor was assigned :  Nor yet the Saxons since, nor times to come had known.  But that her being here, was by this name foresliown,  As prophesying her. For, as the first did tell  Her Sirname, so again doth Ancor lively spell »o   Her Christened title Anne. And as tJwse Virgins there  Did sanctify that place : so holy Edith here  A Recluse long time liv'd, in that fair ^Ihbcy plac'd  Which Alured enriched, and Powlesworth highly grac'd.  A Princess being born, and Abbess, with those Maids, 294     THE THIRTEENTH SONG. 153   All noble like herself, in bidding of their beads   Their holiness bequeath'd, upon her to descend   Which there should after live : in tohose dear self shoidd end   Th' intent of Ancor's name, her coining that decreed,   As hers {her place of birth) fair Coventry tluit freed. soo   But whilst about this tale smooth Ancor trifling stays,  Unto the lustier Tame as loth to come her ways,  The Flood intreats her thus : Dear Brook, why dost thou   wrong  Our mutual love so much, and tediously prolong  Our mirthful marriage-hour, for which I still prepare ? 305  Haste to my broader banks, my joy and only care.  For as of all my Floods thou art the first in fame ;  When frankly thou shalt yield thine honour to my name,  I will protect thy state : then do not wrong thy kind. 309  What pleasure hath the world that here thou may'st not find?   Hence, Muse, divert thy course to Dunsmore, by that Cross^  Where those two mighty ways,^ the JVatling and the Fosse,  Our Centre seem to cut. (The first doth hold her way.  From Dover, to the farth'st of fruitful Anglesey:  The second South and North, from Michael's utmost Mount,  To Cathnesse, which the furth'st of Scotland we account.) 316  And then proceed to show, how Avon from her spring,  By Newnham's* Fount is blest ; and how she, blandishing.  By Dunsmore drives along. Whom Sow doth first assist,  Which taketh Shirhurn in, with Cune, a great while miss'd;  Though Corentn/ from thence her name at first did raise, 32  Now flourishing with fanes, and proud pyramides ;  Her walls in good repair, her ports so bravely built.  Her halls in good estate, her cross so richly gilt.  As scorniner all the Towns that stand within her xiew : 325  Yet must she not be griev'd, that Cune should claim her due.   1 The Hi&lt;ih-cross, supposed to bo the midst of England.   2 See to the Sixteenth Soug. * Neivnham Wells,  ' Otherwise, Cune-tre: that is, the Tovvu upou Cune.     n     154 POLY-OLBION,   Tow'rds JVanckk with this train as Avon trips along,  To Giui-cJiffe being come, her Nymphs thus bravely song ;  To thee renowned Knight, continual i)raise we owe,  And at thy hallowed Tomb thy yearly Obiits show ; 330   Who, thy dear PkilUs name and Country to advance,  Left'st IFarwick's wealthy seat : and sailing into France,  At tilt, from his proud steed, Duke Otton threw'st to ground :  And with th' invalu'd prize of Blanch the beauteous crown'd  (The Almalne Emperor's heir) high acts didst there achieve:  As Lovaine thou again didst valiantly relieve. 336   Thou in the Soldan's blood thy worthy sword imbni'dst ;  And then in single fight, great Auierant subdu'dst.  'Twas thy HercnUan hand, which happily destroy'd  That Dragon, which so long NortJunnhcrhnul annoy'd ; 340  And slew that cruel Boar, which waste our wood-lands laid,  Whose tusks turn'd up our tilths, and dens in meadows made :  Whose shoulder-blade remains at Coventry till now ;  And, at our humble suit, did quell that monstrous Cow  The passengers that us'd from Dunsmorc to affright. 346   Of all our Eiu/lisk (yet) most renowned Knight,  That Colehrond overcam'st : at whose amazing full  The Danes remov'd their camp from JFincl tester's sieg'd wall.

The fault is not in me, but in the wretched time :  On whom, upon good cause, I well may lay the crime : 380  Which as all noble things, so me it doth neglect.  But when th' industrious Muse shall purchase me respect  Of countries near my site, and win me foreign fame  (The Eden of you all deservedly that am)  I shall as much be prais'd for delicacy then, 3S5   As now in small account with vile and barbarous men.  For, from the lofty Edge- that on my side doth lie,  Upon my spacious earth who casts a curious eye,  As many goodly seats shall in my compass see,  As many sweet delights and rarities in me soo   As in the greatest Vale : from where my head I couch   1 The Sheaf.  « The L\l.jL-Jull.     156 POLY-OLBION,   At Cotsirold's country's foot, till with my heels I touch  The North-hamptonian fields,^ and fatt'ning pastures ; where  I ravish every eye with my inticing cheer.

This Algar succeeded him ; and, as a  special title, government, and honour, this Earldom was  therein among the Saxons so singular, that it was hereditary  with a very long pedigree, till the Conquest, from King  Ethelhald's time, above three hundred years. In Malmes-  hurji, he is styled Earl of Hereford ; and indeed, as it seems,  had large dominion over most part of Mereland, and was a  great Protector of good King Edward, from ambitious God-  iciu's faction.

But, to suppose this a Monument of that battle,  fought at Hochnorton, seems to me in matter of certainty  not very probable: I mean, being drawn from Bollds name :  of whose stor}% both for a passage in the last Song, and  here, permit a short examination.^ The Norman' tradition  is, that he, with divers other Danes transplanting them-  selves, as well for dissension twixt him and his King, as  for new seat of habitation, arrived here, had some skir-  mishes with the Englkh defending their territories ; and  soon afterward being admonished in a dream, aided and  advised by King Athdstan, entered Seine in France ; wasted  and won part of it about Paris, Baieux, elsewhere : returned  upon request by embassage to assist the English King  against rebels; and afterward in the year 911 or 912 re-  ceived his Dukedom of Normandy, and Christianity, his  name of Boberf, Avith jEgidia or Gilla (for wife) daughter to  Charles, surnamed the Simple ; as to the Fourth Song I  have, according to the credit of the story, touched it. But  how came such habitude twixt Athelstan and him, before  this 912, when, as it is plain, tliat Athelstan was not King  till 924, or near that i)oint? Neither is any concordance  twixt ylthelstan and this Charles, whose Kingdom was taken  from him by Bodvlph Duke of Burgnndy, two years before  our King Bthvard I. (of the Sa.rons) died. In the ninth  year of whose reign, falling under 906, was that battle of  Hochnoiion ; so that, unless the name of Athelstan be mis-  took for this Edivard, or, be wanting to the Dominical year  of tliose twenty-two of the Dionysian calculation (whereof to  the Fourth Song) I sec no means to make their story stand  with itself, nor our Monks; in whom (most of them writing   ' Inquisition in the Norman Story, partly touched to the Fourth  (Janto.

Read Frodoard, and the old Annals of France,  written nearer the supposed times, and you will scarce find  him to have been, or else there under^ some other name ;  as Godfrey, which some have conjectured, to be the same  with liollo. You may see in ^inUius what uncertainties, if  not contrarieties, were, in Norman traditions of this matter ;  and, I make no question, but of that unknown Nation so  much mistaking hath been of names and times, that scarce  any undoubted truth therein now can justify itself. For,  observe but what is here delivered, and compare it with  them- which say in 998 BoHo was overthrown at Charires by  Eichard Duke of Burgundy, and Ebal Earl of Bolters, assist-  ing JValzelm Bishop of that city ; and, my cjuestion is,  Where have you hope of reconciliation'? Except only in  equivocation of name ; for plainly Hadings, Godfrey, Hroruc  and others (if none of these were the same) all Danes, had  to do, and that with dominion in France about this age ;  wherein it is further reported, that Robert Earl of Faris,^  and in some sort a King twixt Charles and Rodidph, gave to  certain Normans that had entered the land at Loire (they  first entered there in SSS'*) all Little Bretagne and Nants,  and this in 922, wiiich agrees with that gift of the same  tract to Rollo by Charles, little better than harshest discords.  And so doth that of Rollo s being aided by the English  King, and in league with him against the French, with  another received truth : which is, that Charles was (by mai-   1 Ita quiJara apuil P.

Emilius (from whom the  Italian Polydore had many odd pieces of his best contexts)  tells clearly, that she was daughter to Lothar King of Po-  mans, and given by his cousin Charles the Gross, to Godfrey  King of Normans, with Sjilltgtrtcii (that is Neustria) about  886, and imagines that the Norman historians were deceived  by equivocation of name, mistaking Charles the Simple for  Charles the Gross, living near one time ; as also that they  finding Egidia a King's daughter (being indeed Lothar' s)  supposed her Charles the Simples. This makes me think  also that of Godfrey and Polio, hath been like confusion of  name. But both times, reigns, and persons are so dis-  turbed in the stories, that being insufficient to rectify the  contrarieties, I leave you to the liberty of common report.   * Ovinia dicta P. ^milio.   ^ Membran. vetust.

He never seems to smile ; nor ever taketh keep  To hear the harmless swain pipe to his grazing sheep :  Nor to the carter's tune, in whistling to his team ; 25   Nor lends his list'ning ear (once) to the ambling stream,  That in the evening calm against the stones doth rush  With such a murmuring noise, as it would seem to hush  The silent meads asleep ; but, void of all delight,  Remedilessly drown'd in sorrow day and night, 30   Nor Lkhj his ally and neighbour doth respect :  And there\vith being charg'd, thus answereth in effect ; '  That Llrh')/ to his height seem'd slowly but to rise,  And that in length and breadth he all extended lies,  Nor doth like other hills to sudden sharpness mount, 35  That of their kingly kind they scarce can him account ;  Though by his swelling soil set in so high a place,  That Ma.lvaiis mighty self he seemeth to out-face.

And shepherd-like, the Muse thus of that kind doth speak ;  No brown, nor sullied black the face or legs doth streak,  Like those of Moreland, Cank, or of the Cambria 11, Hills 255  That lightly laden are : but Cotsivold wisely fills  Her with the whitest kind : whose brows so Avoolly be,  As men in her fair sheep no emptiness should see.  The staple deep and thick, through, to tlie very grain,  Most strongly keepeth out the violentest rain : 260   A body long and large, the buttocks equal broad ;  As fit to undergo the full and weighty load.  And of the fleecy face, the flank doth nothing lack,  But everywhere is stor'd 3 the belly, as the back.  The fair and goodly flock, the shepherd's only pride, 2C5  As white as winter's snow, when from the river's side  He drives his new-wash'd sheep ; or on the Shearing-day,  When as the lusty ram, with those rich spoils of May     174 POLY-OLBION,   His crooked horns hath crown'd ; the bell-wether, so brave  As none in all the flock they like themselves would have. 270   But Muse, return to tell, how there the Shepherds' King,  Whose flock hath chanc'd that year the earliest lamb to   bring,  In his gay bauldric sits at his low grassy board, [stor'd :  With flawns, curds, clouted-cream, and country dainties  And, whilst the bag-pipe plays, each lusty jocund swain 2:5  Quaff's sillibubs in cans, to all upon the Plain,  And to their country-girls, whose nosegays they do wear,  Some roundelays do sing : the rest, the burthen bear.   But Cotsivold,^ be this spoke to th' only praise of thee,  That thou of all the rest, the chosen soil should'st be, 280  Fair Isis to bring forth (the Mother of great Tames)  With those delicious Brooks, by whose immortal streams,  Her greatness is begun : so that our Rivers' King,  When he his long descent shall from his bel-sires bring.  Must needs (Great Pastures' Prince) derive his stem by thee.

For, in Ptolemijs time about 1460  years since the utmost declination of the sun in the first of  Cancer (where she is nearest to our vertical point) was 23  Gr. and about 52 Minut. since that, Alhatcgni (about Char-  lemaine's time) observed it some 15 Scruples less :, after him  (near 1000th year of Christ) Arzachel found it 23 Gr. 34 Scr.,   * A soil fruitful enough, except of olives and vines, which are for  hotter climates.   t One park and six arpens of vineyard, and brings forth some  twenty tirkius of wine, if the year prove well.   ^ Camd. in Trinobantihus. - Malmesb. de Pontificura Gestis, 4.

So that (by this calculation) about 24 minutes  the sun comes not now so near our Zenith, as it did in  Ptolemy's time. But in truth (for in these things I accompt  that truth, which is warranted by most accurate observa-  tion ; and those learned mathematicians, by omitting of  parallax and refractions, deceived themselves and poste-  rity) the declination in this age is 23 Gr. 31i Scrup. as  that noble Dane, and most honoured restorer of astrono-  mical motions, Tijcho Brake, hath taught us: which, although  it be greater than that of Copernicus and his followers, yet  is much less than what is in Ptolemy; and by two scruples  different from Arzuchers, so justifying the Author's conceit,  supposing the cause of our climate's not now producing  wines, to be the sun's declination from us, which for every  scruple answers in earth, about one of our miles ; but a far  more large distance in the celestial globe. I can as well  maintain this high-fetched cause, being upon difference of  so few minutes in one of the slowest motions, and we see  that greatest effects are always attributed to them, as upon  the old conceit of the Plutonic year, abridged into near his  half by Copernicus, those consequents foretold upon the  change of eccentrics^ out of one sign into another, the Equi-  noctial prsecession, and such like ; as others may their con-  version of a planet's state into Fortunafc, Oppred, or Coin-  hust, by measuring or missing their IG Scruples of Cazimi,  their Orhes moities, and such curiosities.

For,  admitting that were true, yet judicial astrology relies more  upon aspect and beams falling on us with angles (which are  much altered by this change of obliquity in the Zodiac) than  distance of every singular star from the earth. But indeed,  upon mistaking the pole's altitude, and other error in ob-  servation, Copernicus* was deceived, and in this present age  the sun's eccentricity (in Ptolemy, being the 24th of the  eccentric's semidiameter, divided into GO) hath been found^  between the 27th and 28th P. which is far greater than that  in Copernicus, erroneously making it but near the 31st.

For, Alsbury's a Vale* that walloweth in her wealth,  And (by her wholesome air continually in health)  Is lusty, frim, and fat, and holds her youthful strength.  Besides her fruitful earth, her mighty breadth and length, 30  Doth CluUern fitly match : which mountainously high.

Too much, a surfeit breeds, and may our Child annoy :  These fat and luscious meats do but our stomachs cloy. 50'  The modest comely mean, in all things likes the wise.  Apparel often shews us womanish precise,  xind what will Cotmold think when he shall hear of this ?  He'll rather blame your waste, than praise your cost, I wiss.   But, women wilful be, and she her will must have, 55  Nor cares how Chilfeni chides, so that her Tame be brave.

The pleasant Surryan shores shall in that Flood delight, io5   And Kent esteem herself most happy in his sight.

This rich and goodly Fane which ruin'd thou dost see,  Quoth Vcr, the motive is that thou importuti'st me:  But to another thing thou cunningly dost fly, 55   And reason seera'st to urge of her sterility.  With that he fetch'd a sigh, and ground his teeth in rage ;  Quoth Fer even for the sin of this accursed Age.  Behold that goodly Fane, which ruin'd now doth stand.

In memory of whom, (as more than half-divine)  Our English Offa rear'd a rich and sumptuous shrine  And monastery here : which our succeeding kings, 05   From time to time endow'd with many goodly things.  And many a Christian knight was buried here, before  The Noi'man set his foot upon this conquered shore ;  And after those brave spirits in all those baleful stowers,  That with Duke liobert^ went against the Pagan powers, ro   ' T.ook before to the Eleventh Song.   * With the clJost sou of the Conqueror into the Holy Laud.     19S POLY-OLBION,   And in their Country's right at Cressy those that stood,  And that at Foyters bath'd their bilbowes in French blood ;  Their vahant Nephews next at Ag'inanirt that fought,  Whereas rebellious France upon her knees was brought :  In this Religious House at some of their returns, T5   When Nature claira'd her due, here plac'd their hallowed   urns :  AVhich now devouring Time, in his so mighty waste,  Demolishing those walls, hath utterly defac'd.

When in my prime of youth I was a gallant Flood ; so   In those free golden days, it was the satire's use  To tax the guilty times, and rail upon abuse :  But soothers find the way preferment most to win ;  Who serving great men's turns, become the bawds to sin. oo   When JratUixj in his words that took but small delight,  Hearing the angry Brook so cruelly to bite ;  As one that fain would drive these fancies from his mind,  Quoth he, I'll tell thee things that suit thy gentler kind.

Personating  the Genius of Ferlam, that ever-famous Spenser'^ sung,   / ivas that Citie, which the Garland ivore  Of Britaine's Pride, delivered unto me  By Eomane Victors, which it wonne of yore ;  Though nought at cdl hut Ruines now I bee,  And lye in mine owne asJies, as ye see :  Verlam Iwas ; what bootes it that I was,  Sith now I am but weedes and wastfull gras ?   As under the Romans, so in the Saxon% times afterward it  endured a second ruin : and, out of its corruption, after the  Abbey erected hy li\i\g Offa, was generated that of Saint  Albans ; whither, in later times most of the stone-works  and whatsoever fit for building was by the Abbots trans-  lated. =* So that,     Now reniaines no memorie.

Thou saw'st great burthen'd ships through these thy  valleys pass.   Lay not here unlikelihoods to the Author's charge ; he  tells you more judiciously towards the end of the Song.  But the cause why some have thought so, is, for that, Gll-  das,^ speaking of S. Allan's martyrdom and his miraculous  passing through the river at Verlamcestre, calls it iter igno-  tum trans Thamesis fluvii alveum* : so by collection they  guessed that Thames had then his full course this way, being  thereto further moved by anchors and such like here digged  up. This conjecture hath been followed by that noble  Muse^ thus in the person of Verlam :   And ivhere the christuU Thamis tvont to slide  In silver channell douiic along the lee,  About whose flowrie banJces on either side  A thousand Nymphes, with mirthfull joUitce,  Were wont to play, from all annoyance free :  There noio no river's course is to he scene,  But moorish fennes, and marshes ever greene.

Since us Ms Kingly Ways Molmutius first began.   Near 500 years before our Saviour, this King Mohmtius  (take it upon credit of the British story) constituted divers  laws ; especially that ChnrcJies, Ploughs, and Higli-ioays  should have liberties of Sanctuary, by no authority vio-  lable. That Churches should be free and enjoy liberty for  refuge, consenting allowance of most nations have tole-  rated, and in this kingdom (it being affirmed also by con-  stitution of King Lucius^ a Christian,) every Churchyard  was a Sanctuar}^, until by Act of Parliament^ under Hen.  VIII. that licence, for protection of offences, being too  much abused, was taken away ; but, whether now restored  in the last Parliament,^ Avherein all Statutes concerning  Abjuraliv/o or Sanctuary mside before 35 Eliz. are repealed,  I examine not. The Plough and Husbandmen have by our  Statutes* and especially by Civil ^ and Persian^ law, great  freedom. High-ways, being without exception necessary,  as well for peace as war, have been defended in the Pomari^  laws, and are taken in ours, to be in that respect (as they  are by implication of the name) the King's HigJi-ivays,^ and  res sacrce : et qui aliquid imle occupaverit excedendo fines et ter-  minos terrm sua: dicifurfccissc Purpresfuram super ipsum Begem*  According to this privilege of Mulmufius in the Statute of   1 Florilegus. 2 00 /fe«. 8. cap. 14.

But the old rolls of the Statute  'as I have seen in a fair MS. examined by the exemplification,  for the Record itself is with many other lost) had not those  words, as the Register' also specially admonishes, nor is any  'lart of that Chapter in some MSS. which I marvel at, see-  g we have a formal writ grounded upon it.

THE SIXTEENTH SONG. 213   Hen. III. When as it is plain that he was not Archbishop  until 25. The best copy that ever I saw had Simon Arch-  bishop of Canterbury : which indeed was worse, there being  no such prelate of that See in those times ; but the mis-  taking was by the transcriber turning the single S. (accord-  ing to the form of writing in that age) into Simon for  Stephen, who was {Stephen of Langton) Archbishop at that  time. But I forget myself in following matter of my more  particular study, and return to Mohmdius. His constitution  being general for liberty of Highways, controversy grew  about the course and limits of them : whereupon his son,  King Belin, to quit the subject of that doubt, caused more  specially these four, here presently spoken of, to be made,  which might be for interrupted passage, both in war and  peace ; and hence by the Author, they are called Military,  (a name given by the Romans to such High-ways, as were  for their marching armies) and indeed by more polite con-  ceit^ and judicious authority these our Ways have been  thought a work of the Romans also. But their courses  are differently reported, and in some part their names  also. The Author calls them JVatling-street, the Fosse, Iki-  nild and Rickeneld. This name of Rickenekl is in Randall  of Chester, and by him derived from S. Veicics in I'cn-  broke into Hereford, and so through JVorcester, JFaricick,  Derby, and Fo/l'-shires to Tinmouth, which (upon the Au-  thor's credit reporting it to me) is also justifiable by a very  ancient deed of lands, bounded near Bermingliam in JVar-  wickshire by Rickeneld. To endeavour certainty in them,  were but to obtrude unwarrantable conjecture, and abuse  time and you. Of IFatling (who is here personated, and so  much the more proper because Verlam was called also by  the English,- JVatliagchestcr,) it is said that it went from  ^ Y. Camden Roman. ^ Lhuid. Brevior. Brit.     214 POLY-OLBION.   Dover in Kent, and so by AVest of London (yet part of the  name seems to this day left in the middle of the City) to  this place, and thence in a crooked line through Shropsshire  by JVreldn Hill into Cardigan^ ; but others- say from Vcrlam  to CJiester ; and where all is referred to Belin by Geffrey n^  Arthur, and Fohjchronicon, another^ tells you that the sons  of (I know not what) King JFetlde made, and denominated  it. The Foise is derived by one consent out of Cornwall  into Dcronshire, through Somerset, over Cotes-wold by Teukes-  burie, along near Coventry to Lewester, through Lincoln to  Benoick, and thence to Cathness the utmost of Scotland. Of  restitution of the other you may be desperate ; likkeneld  I have told you of. In Henry of Huntingdon, no such name  is found, but with the first two, Ickenild and Ermingsfreet.  IckenUd, saith he, goes from Eiist to AYest ; Ermingstreet  from South to North. Another tells me that Ermingstreet  begins at S. Dewies, and conveys itself to Soutluimiiton ;  which the Author hath attributed to Ichning, begun (upon  the word's community with Iccns) in the Eastern parts. It's  not in my power to reconcile all these, or elect the best ;  I only add, that Ermingstreet (which being of English idiom,  seems to have had its name from Ijnnunfull in that signi-  fication, whereby it interprets^ an universal pillar wor-  shipped for Mercury, President of Ways,) is like enough (if  Huntingdon be in the right, making it from South to North)  to have left its part in Stanstreet in Surrey, where a way  made Avith stones and gravel in a soil on both sides very  different, continues near a mile ; and thence towards the  Eastern shore in Sussex are some places seeming as other  relics of it. But I here determine nothiner.     'o-     ^ Polychronic. lib. 1. cap. de Plat. reg.   ' Henric. Huntiiigd. Hist. 1.   ^ Roger Hoveduu. part 1. fol. 248.   * Adam Brcmeiis. hist. Eccles. cap. 5. And see to the Third Soug.     THE SEVENTEENTH SONG.     10     The Argument.   To Medway, Tames a suitor goes ;   But fancies Mole, as forth he flows.   Her Mother, Homesdale, holds her in :   She digs through earth, the Tames to win.   Great Tames, as King of Rivers, sings   The Catalogue of th' English Kings.   Thence the light Muse, to th' Southward soars,   The Surrian and Sussexian shores ;   The Forests and the Doicns surveys,   With Billets running to those Seas ;   This Song of hers then cutteth short.   For things to come, of much import.   T length it came to pass, that his and her Tame  0( Medway understood, a Nymph of wondrous fame ;  And much desirous were, their princely Tames should  prove  If (as a wooer) he could win her maiden-love ;  That of so great descent, and of so large a dower, s   Might well-ally their House, and much increase his power :  And striving to prefer their Son, the best they may,  Set forth the lusty Flood, in rich and brave array,  Bank'd with imbrodered meads, of sundry suits of flowers.  His breast adorn'd with swans, oft wash'd with silver showers;      216 POLY-OLBION,   A train of gallant Floods, at such a costly rate n   As might beseem their care, and fitting his estate.   Attended and attir'd magnificently thus.  They send him to the Court of great Oceanus,  The world's huge wealth to see ; yet with a full intent, i»  To woo the lovely Nymph, fair Medway, as he went.  Wiio to his Dame and Sire his duty scarce had done,  And Avhilst they sadly wept at parting of their Son,  See what the Tames befell, when 'twas suspected least.   As still his goodly train yet every hour increast, 20   And from the Surrian shores clear J^Fey came down to meet  His greatness, whom the Tames so graciously doth greet,  That with the fern-crown'd Flood* he minion-like doth play :  Yet is not this tlie Brook, enticeth him to stay.  But as they thus, in })omp, came sporting on the shoal, 25  '(xainst Hampton-Court he meets the soft and gentle Mole.  AVhose eyes so pierc'd his breast, that seeming to foreslow  The way which he so long intended was to go,  With trifling up and down, he wand'reth here and there ;  And that he in her sight, transparent might appear, 30   Applies himself to fords, and setteth his delight  On that which most might make him gracious in her sight.   Tlien Isls and the Tame from their conjoined bed,  Desirous still to learn how Tames their son had sped  (For greatly they had hop'd, his time had so been spent, 35  That he ere this had won the goodly heir of Kent)  And sending to enquire, had news return'd again  (By such as they imploy'd, on purpose in his train)  How this their only heir, the Ides emperial Flood,  Had loitered thus in love, neglectful of his good. 40   No marvel (at the news) though Ousei and Tame were sad,  More comfort of tlieir son expecting to have had. [show'd :  Nor blame them, in their looks much sorrow though they   • Coming Ijy Ftruham, so called oi/cru there groM-ing. f laU.     THE SEVENTEENTH SONG. 2li   'Who fearing lest lie might thus meanly be bestow'd,   And knowing danger still increased by delay, 4S   Employ their utmost power, to hasten him away.   But Tames would hardly on : oft turning back to show,   From his muchdoved Mole how loth he was to go.   The mother of the 3IoIe, old Homesdale* likewise bears  Th' affection of her child, as ill as they do theirs : 5&amp;   Who nobly though deriv'd, yet could have been content,  T' have match'd her with a Flood, of far more mean descent.  But Mole respects her words, as vain and idle dreams,  Compar'd with that high joy, to be belov'd of Tames:  And head-long holds her course, his company to win. S5  But, Homesdale raised hills, to keep the straggler in ;  That of her daughter's stay she need no more to doubt :  (Yet never was thei-e help, but love could find it out.)  § Mole digs herself a path, by working day and night  (According to her name, to show her nature right) so   And underneath the earth, for three miles' space doth creep :  Till gotten out of sight, quite from her mother's keep.  Her fore-intended course the wanton Nymph doth run ;  As longing to imbrace old Tane and Isls son. [take.   When Tames now understood, what pains the Mole did  How far the loving Nymph adventur'd for his sake ; 66   Although with Medwai/ match'd, yet never could remove  The often quick'ning sparks of his more ancient love.  So that it comes to pass, when by great Nature's guide  The Ocean doth return, and thrustetli-in the tide ; to   Up tow'rds the place, where first his much-lov'd Mole was   seen,  § He ever since doth flow, beyond delightful Sheene}   Then Jrandal cometh in, the Mole's belov6d mate,  So amiable, fair, so pure, so dehcate,   * A very woody Vale in Stiny.   ^ Tames obbs and tluws beyond Richmond,     218 POLY-OLBION,   So plump, so full, so fresh, her eyes so wondrous clear : rs  And first unto her Lord, at JFandsworth doth appear.  That in the goodly Court, of their great sovereign Tames,  There might no other speech be had amongst the Streams,  But only of this Nymph, sweet JFandal, what she wore ;  Of her complexion, grace, and how herself she bore. so   But now this mighty Flood, upon his voyage prest,  (That found how with his strength, his beauties still increast,  From where, brave JFindsor stood on tip-toe to behold  The fair and goodly Tames, so far as ere he could,  With kingly houses crown'd, of more than earthly pride, ss  Upon his either banks, as he along doth glide)  With wonderful delight, doth his long course pursue.  Where Otlands, Hampton-Court, and Pdchmond he doth view.  Then JFest minster the next great Tames doth entertain ;  That vaunts her Palace large, and her most sumptuous Fane :  The Land's Tribunal seat that challengeth for hers, 91   The Crowning of our Kings, their famous Sepulchres.  Then goes he on along by that more beauteous Strand,  Expressing both the wealth and brav'ry of the Land.  (So many sumptuous Bowers, within so little space, «5   The all-beholding sun scarce sees in all his race.)  And on by London leads, which like a crescent lies,^  Whose windows seem to mock the star-befreckled skies ;  Besides her rising spires, so thick themselves that show,  As do the bristling reeds, witliin his banks that grow. aoo  There sees his crowded wharfs, and peoplc-pestred shores.  His bosom over-spread, with shoals of labouring oars :  With that most costly Bridge, that doth liini most renown, -  By which he clearly puts all other Rivers down.   Thus furnishd'd with all that appertain'd to State, 105   Desired by the Floods (his greatness which await)   ^ London Ij'inj!; like a half-moon.   * Loiidon-briilija tlie Crown of Tames,     THE SEVENTEENTH SONG. 219   That as the rest before, so somewhat he would sing,  Both worthy of their praise, and of himself their King ;  A Catalogue of those, the Sceptre here that sway'd.  The princely Tames recites, and thus his Song he laid : no   As Bastard JFiUiam first, by Conquest hither came,  And brought the Norman Rule, upon the English name :  So with a tedious war, and almost endless toils.  Throughout his troubled reign, here held his hard-got spoils.  Deceasing at the last, through his unsettled State, lis   § Left (with his ill-got Crown) unnatural debate.  For, dying at his home, his eldest son abroad,  (Who, in the Holy-war, his person then bestow'd)  His second Eufus next usurp'd the wronged reign :  § And by a fatal dart, in his New Forest slain, 120   Whilst in his proper right religious Robert slept,  Through craft into the Throne the younger i)f«w-c/ertr/; crept.  From whom his Sceptre, then, whilst Robert strove to wrest,  The other (of his power that amply was possest)  With him in battle join'd : and, in that dreadful day 125  (Where Fortune show'd herself all human power to sway)  Duke Robert went to wrack ; and taken in the flight,  § Was by that cruel King deprivt'd of his sight.  And in close prison put ; where miserably he died :   But Henry's whole intent was by just heaven denied, lao  For, as of light, and life, he that sad Lord bereft ;  So his, to whom the Land he purpos'd to have left.  The raging seas devour'd,* as hitherward they sail'd.   When, in this Line direct, the Conqnerofs issue fail'd,  Twbct Henry's daughter Mauld, the Almayne Emperour's  Bride 135   (Which after to the Earl of Anjou was affi'd)  And Stephen Earl of Bloys, the Conqueror's Sister's son,  A fierce and cruel war immediately begun ;   * See the last note to tho Fourth Song.     220 POLY-OLBION,   Who with their several powers, arrived here from France,  By force of hostile arms, their titles to advance. i4o   But, Stephen, what by coin, and what by foreign strength,  Through worlds of danger gain'd the glorious goal at length.   But, left without an heir, the Empress' issue next,  No title else on foot ; upon so fair pretext,  The Second Henry soon upon the throne was set, 145   (Which Mauld to Jeffrey bare) the first Plantagenet.  Who held strong wars with Wales, that his subjection spurn'd :  'WHiich oftentimes he beat ; and, beaten oft, return'd :  With his stern children vex'd : who (whilst he strove t' advance  His right within this Isle) rais'd war on him in France. 150  With his high fame in fight, what cold breast was not fir'd?  Through all the Western world, for wisdom most admir'd.   Then Richard got the Eule, his most renowned son ;  Whose courage, him the name of Cure De Lion won. [born.  With those first earthly Gods, had this brave Prince been  His daring hand had from Alcicles' shoulders torn 150   The Nemean Lion's hide : who in the Holy-land  So dreadful was, as thougli from Jove and Neptune's hand,  The thund'ring three-fork'd fire, and trident he had reft,  And him to rule their charge they only then had left. leo  Him John again succeeds ; who, having put-away  Young Arthur (liichard's son) the Sceptre took to sway.  Who, of the common-wealth first havoc having made,  § His sacrilegious hands upon the Churches laid,  In cruelty and rape continuing out his reign ; les   That his outrageous lust and courses to restrain,  § The Baronage were forc'd defensive arms to raise.  Their daughters to redeem, that he by force would seize.  Which the first Civil War in England here begun.  And for his sake such hate his son young Henry won, i7o  That to d&lt;'pose their Prince, th' revengeful people thought ;  And from the Line of France young Lewis to have brought.     THE SEVENTEEXTII SONG. 221   To take on him our Eule : but, Henry got the throne,  By his more forceful friends : who, wise and puissant grown,  § The general Charter seiz'd ; that into slavrey drew \-ji  The freest-born English blood. Of which such discord grew,  And in the Barous' breasts so rough combustions rais'd.  With much expense of blood as long was not appeas'd.  By strong and tedious gusts held up on either side,  Betwixt the Prince and Peers, with equal power and  pride. ISO   He knew the worst of war, match'd with the Barons strong ;  Yet victor liv'd, and reign'd both happily and long.   This long-liv'd Prince expir'd : the next succeeded ; he.  Of us, that for a God might well related be.  Our Long-shanks, Scotland's scourge: who to the Orcadsraught  His Sceptre, and with him from wild Albania brought ise  The reliques of her crown (by him first placed here)  § The seat on which her Kings inaugurated were.  He tam'd the desperate Welsh, that out so long had stood,  And made them take* a Prince, sprung of the English blood.  This Isle, from sea to sea, he generally controll'd, loo   And made the other parts of England both to hold.   This Edivard, First of ours, a Second then ensues ;  Who both his name and birth, by looseness, did abuse :  Fair Ganymeds and fools who rais'd to princely places ; 193  And chose not men for wit, but only for their faces.  In parasites and knaves, as he repos'd his trust,  Who sooth'd him in his ways apparantly unjust;  For that preposterous sin wherein he did offend.  In his posterior parts had his preposterous end. 200   A Third then, of that name, amends for this did make :  Who from his idle sire seem'd nought at all to take.  But as his grand-sire did his Empire's verge advance :  So led he forth his powers, into the heart of France.  * Sec before to the Ninth Song.     222 rOLY-OLBIOK,   And fast'ning on that right, he by his mother had, ao5   Against the Salique law, which utterlj^ forbad  § Their women to inherit ; to propagate his cause,  At Cressey with his sword first cancelled those laws :  Then like a furious storm, through troubled France he ran ;  And by the hopeful hand of brave Black Edward wan 2in  Proud Poijtiers, where King John he valiantly subdu'd,  The miserable French and there in mammocks hew'd ;  Then Avitli bis battering rams made earth-quakes in their  Till trampled in the dust herself she yielded ours, [towers,  As migbty Edward's heir, to a Second Richard then 215  (Son to that famous Prince Black Edward, Man of Men,  Untimely that before his conquering father died)  Too soon the Kingdom fell : who his vain youth applied  To wantonness and spoil, and did to favour draw  Unworthy ignorant sots, with whose dull eyes he saw : 220  AVho plac'd their like in Court, and made them great in State,  (Which wise and virtuous men, beyond all plagues, might  To whom he blindly gave: who blmdly spent again, [hate.)  And oft oppress'd his Land, their riot to maintain.  He hated his allies, and the deserving sterv'd ; 226   ]Iis minions and his will, the Gods he only serv'd :  And, finally, depos'd, as he was ever friend  To ribalds, so again by villains had his end.   Henry the Son of Gaunt, supplanting liichard, then  Ascended to the Throne : when discontented men, 230   Desirous first of change, which to that height him brought,  Deceived of their ends, into his actions sought ;  And, as they set him up, assay'd to pluck him down :  From whom he hardly held his ill-achieved Crown ;  That, treasons to suppress which oft he did disclose, 23.   Ami raising public arms, against his powerful foes,  His usurpation still Ijcing troubled to maintain.  His short disquiet days scarce raught a peaceful reign.     THE SEVEj^TEENTH SONG. 223   ' A Fifth succeeds the Fourth : but how his father got  The Crown, by right or wrong, the son respecteth not. 240  Nor further hopes for that e'er leaveth to pursue ;  But doth his claim to France courageously renew ;  Upon her wealthy shores un-lades his warlike fraught ;  And, showing us the fields where our brave fathers fought,  First drew his sun-bright sword, reflecting such a light, 245  As put sad guilty France into so great a fright.  That her pale Genius sank; which trembling seem'd to stand,  When first he set his foot on her rebellious land.  That all his grand-sire's deeds did over, and thereto  Those high achievements add the former could not do : 250  At Agincourfs proud fight, that quite put Poijtlers down ;  Of all, that time who liv'd, the King of most renown.  Whose too untimely end, the Fates too soon did haste :  Whose nine years noble acts, nine worlds deserve to last.   A Sixth in name succeeds, born great, the mighty son 255  Of him, in England's right that spacious France had won.  Who coming young to reign, protected by the Peers  Until his non-age out : and grown to riper years,  Prov'd upright, soft, and meek, in no wise loving war ;  But fitter for a cowl, than for a crown by far. 26O   Whose mildness over-much, did his destruction bring :  A wondrous godly man, but not so good a King.  Like whom yet never man tried fortune's change so oft ;  So many times thrown-down, so many times aloft 26-t   (When with the utmost power, their friends could them afford,  The Yorkists, put their right upon the dint of sword)  As still he lost and won, in that long bloody war,  § From those two Factions styl'd, of York and Lancaster.

Twixt  this William and Foberf, as also twixt him and Henry I. all  brothers (and sons to the Conqueror) were divers oppositions  for the Kingdom and Dukedom, which here the Author  alludes to. Our stories in every hand inform you : and  will discover also the Conqueror's adoption by the Confessor,  Harold's oath to him, and such institutions of his lawful  title enforced by a case''^ reported of one .English, who, de-  riving his right from seisin before the Conquest, recovered  by judgment of King William I. the Manor of Sharboni in  Norfolk against one Warren a Norman, to whom the King  had before granted it : which had been unjust, if he had  by right of war only gotten the kingdom ; for then had all   ' Gul.

But (admit  this case as you please, or any cause of right beside his  sword) it is plain that his will and imperious affection  (moved by their rebellions which had stood for the sworn  Harold) disposed all things as a Conqueror : Upon observa-  tion of his subjection of all lauds to tenures, his change of  laws, disinheriting the English, and such other reported  (which could be but where the profitable Dominion, as  Civilians call it, was universally acquired into the Prince's  hand) and in reading the disgraceful account then made of  the English name, it will be manifest.   120.

JFiUiam had much to do with  his brother liohert justly grudging at his usurping the  Crown from right of primogeniture ; but so much the less,  in that liohert with divers other German and French Princes  left all private respects for the Holy War, which after the  Cross undertaken (as those times used) had most fortunate  success in Recovery of Palestine. Robert had no more but  the Duchy of Normandij, nor that without swords often  drawn, before his Holy expedition : about which (having  first offer of, but refusing, the Kingdom of Jerusalem) after  he had some five years been absent, he returned into Eng-  land, finding his younger brother {Henry I.) exalted into  his hereditary throne. For, although it were undoubtedly  agreed that liohert was eldest son of the Conqueror, yet  the pretence which gave Henry the Crown (beside the  means of his working favorites) was, that he was the only  issue horn after his fatJi^r was a King:* upon which point  a great question is disputed among Civilians.^ Rohert was  no sooner returned into Normandy, but presently (first ani-  mated l)y Randall, Bishop of Durham, a great disturber of  the common peace twixt the Prince and subject by intoler-  able exactions and unlimited injustice under JniUam II.,  whose Chief Justicet it seems he was, newly escaped out of  prison, whither for those State-misdemeanors he was com-  mitted b)'' Henry) he despatches and interchanges intelli-  gence with most of the Baronage, claiming his primogeni-  ture-right, and thereby the kingdom.

This peace,  upon denial of payment (which had the better colour, be-  cause, at a request of Queen Maude, the Duke prodigally  released his 2,000 pounds the next year after the covenant)  was soon broken. The King (to prevent what mischief  might follow a second arrival of his brother) assisted by  the greatest favours of Normandy and Avjou, besieged Duke  Robert in one of his castles, took him, brought him home  cajitive, and at length using that course (next secure to  death) so often read of in Choniafes, Cantacuzen, and other  Oriental stories, put out his eyes, being all this time im-  prisoned in Cardiff Castle in Glamorgan, where he miserably  breathed his last. It is by Pohjdore added, out of some  authority, that King Henry after a few years imprisonment  released him, and commanded that within 40 days and 12  hours (these hours have in them time of two floods, or a  flood and an ebb) he should, abjuring Enrjland and Nor-  mandy, pass the seas as in perpetual exile ; and that in the  mean time, upon new treasons attempted by him, he was  secondly committed, and endured his punishment and death  as the common Monks relate. I find no warrantable au-  thority that makes me believe it : yet, because it gives  some kind of example of our obsolete law of Abjuration,  (which it seems had its beginning from one of the Statutes  published under the name of the Confessor) a word or two  of the time prescribed here for his passage : which being  examined upon Bracion's credit, makes the report therein  faulty. For he seems confident that the 40 days in abju-  ration, were afterward induced upon the Statute of Clarin-  don *vflnch gave the accused of Felony, or Treason, although  ♦ Jlen. 2. ap Rog.

I know it is a  point very intricate to determine, observing these opposite  authors and no express resolution. Since them, the Oath  of Abjuration published among our Manual Statutes nearly  agrees with this of Duke Jtohert, but with neither of those  old Lawyers. In it, after the Felon confesses, and abjures,  and hath his Port appointed ; / ivill (proceeds the Oath)  diligently eiideavour to jxiss over at that Port, and loill not delay  time there above a flood and an ebb, if I may have passage in  tliat space ; if not, I will every day go into the sea up to the  hiees, assaying to go over, and unless I may do this icithin Forty  continual days I will return to the Sanclicanj, as a Felon of our  Lord the King ; So God me help, dx. So here the forty days  are to be spent about the passage and not in the sanctuary.  Compare this with other authorities,- and you shall find all  so dissonant, that reconciliation is impossible, resolution  very difficult. I only offer to their consideration, which can  here judge, why Hubert de Jhirch (Earl of Kent, and Chief  Justice of England under Hen.

His sacrilegious hands upon tJie Churches laid.   The great controversy about electing the Archbishop of  Canterbury (the King as his right bad him, commanding  that John Bishop of Norwich should have the Prelacy, the  Pope, being Innocent III. for his own gain, aided with some  disloyal Monks of Canterbury, desiring, and at last conse-  crating Stephen of Langton, a Cardinal) was first cause of it.  For King John would by no means endure this Stephen, nor  permit him the dignity after his unjust election at Borne,  but banished the Monks, and stoutly menaces the Pope.  He presently makes delegation to JFilliam Bishop of London,  Eustace of Ely,. and Malgere of Worcester, that they should,  with monitory advice, offer persuasion to the King of con-  formity to the Ilomish behest ; if he persisted in constancy,  they should denounce England under an interdict. The  Bishops tell King John as much, who suddenly, moved with  imperious affection and scorn of Papal usurpation, swears,  by God's tooth, if they or any otiier, with imadvised attempt, sub-  ject his Kingdom to an interdict, he tcould presently drive every  p'elate and priest of England to the Pope, and confiscate all  their substance; and of all the Romans amongst them, he ivould  first pull out their eyes, and cut off their noses, and tlien send  them all packing,^ with other like threatening terms, which  notwithstanding were not able to cause them desist ; but  within little time following, in public denunciation they  jierformed their authority ; and the King, in some sort, his  threatenings, committing all Abbeys and Priories to lay-  men's custody, and compelling every priest's concubine to  a grievous fine. Thus for a while continued the liealm   ^ 9, Joann. Keg.

Easily you shall not find a Prince more  beneficial to the holy cause than he, if you take his former  part of reign, before this ambitious Stephen of Langton's elec-  tion exasperated desire of revenge. Most kind habitude  then was twixt him and the Pope, and for alms toward  J&lt;erusahm's aid he gave the fortieth part of his revenue, and  caused his Baronage to second his example. Although  therefore he was no waj^s excusable of many of those faults,  both in government and religion, which are laid on him, yet  it much extenuates the ill of his action, that he was so be-  sieged with continual and undigestable incentives of the  Clergy with traitorous confidence striking at his Crown, and  in such sort, as humanity must have exceeded itself, to have  endured it with any mixture of patience. Nor ever shall I  impute that his wicked attempt of sending Ambassadors,  Thomas Ilardington, Ralph Fit-Nicholas, and Robert of Lori'  don, to Amiramidly, King of Morocco, for the Mahometan  Religion, so much to his own will and nature, as to the per-  secuting Bulls, Interdicts, Excommunications, Deposings,  and such like, published and acted by them Avhich counter-  f(uting the vain name of Pastors, shearing and not feeding  their sheep, made this poor King (for they brought him so  poor, that he was called Johannes sine terra*) even as a  phrenetic, commit what posterity receives now among the  worst actions (and in themselves they arc so) of Princes.   icr.

But at length by treaty in Baningmede^ near Stanes, he gave  them two Charters ; the one, of Liberties general, the other  of the Forest : both which were not very different from our  Graund Charter- and that of the Forest. The Pope at his  request confirmed all : but the same year, discontentment  (through too much favour and respect given by the King to  divers strangers, whom, since the) composition with the Le-  gate, he had too frequently, and in too high esteem, enter-  tained) renewing among the Barons, Ambassadors were sent  to advertise the Pope what injury the See of Borne had by  this late exaction of such liberties out of a kingdom, in  which it had such great interest (for King John had been  very prodigal to it, of his best and most majestical titles)  and with what commotion the Barons had rebelled against  him, soon obtained a Bull cursing in thunder all such as  stood for any longer maintenance of those granted Charters :  This (as how could it be otherwise ?) bred new but almost  incurable broils in the State twixt King and subject : but  in whom more, than in the Pope and his Archbishop, was  cause of this dissension 1 Both, as wicked boutefeus apply-  ing themselves to both parts; sometimes animating the sub-  ject by censorious exauthorizing the Prince, then assisting  and moving forward his proneness to faitliless abrogation,  by pretence of au interceding universal authority.   16.

The issue male of Philip the Fair thus failing,  Philip son and heir of Charles Earl of Valois, P&gt;eamnont,  Alenson, &amp;c. (which was brother to Philip the Fair) chal-  lenged the Crown of France as next heir male against this  Edvjard, who answered to the objection of the Salique law,  that (admitting it as their assertion was, yet) he Avas Heir  Male although descended of a daughter : and in a public  assembly of the Estates first about the Protectorship of the  womb (for. Queen Jane Dowager of the Fair Charles, was.  left with child, but afterward delivered of a daughter,  Blanch, afterwards Duchess of Orleans) was this had in  solemn disputation by lawyers on both sides, and applied  at length also to the direct point of inheriting the Crown.  What followed upon judgment given against his right, the  valiant and famous deeds of him and his English, recorded  in Walsingham, Froissart, yEmilius, and the multitude of  later collected stories, make manifest. But for the Law  itself ; every mouth speaks of it, few I think understand at  all why they name it. The opinions are, that it being part  of the ancient Laws made among the Salians (the same vnth.  Franks) under King Pharamond about 1200 years since, hath  thence denomination ; and, Goropius (that fetches all out of  Dutch, and more tolerably perhaps this than many other of  his etymologies) deriving the S(dians' name from s'«il, which  in contraction he makes frora^ ;§'aticlt (inventors whereof  the Franks, saith he, were) interprets them, as it were,  Horsemen, a name fitly applied to the warlilve and most   * Hutin. ^ Francic. lib. 2. \ As our word Saddle.     248 POLY-OLBION,   noble of any nation, as Chivalers^ in French, and Equifes in  Ldin allows likewise.

Becamis undertakes a conjecture  of the first cause which excluded Gyncecocrucij among them,  guessing it to be upon their observation of the misfortune  in war, which their neighbours the Bructerans (a people  about the now Over Issel in the Netherlands, from near whom  he as many other first derive the Franks) endured in time of  Vespasian, under conduct and empire of one Velleda,^ a lady  even of di\'ine esteem amongst them.

On the other side,  Lionel Duke of Clarence the third brother had only issue  Philippa, a daughter married to Edmuml Mortimer, Earl of  March (who upon this title was designed Heir apparant to  Puch. II.), Edmimd, by her had Roger ; to Pioger was issue  two sons, and two daughters : but all died without poste-  rity, excepting Anne ; through her married to Richard Earl  of Cambridge, son to Edmund of Langley, was conveyed (to  their issue Richard Duke of York father to King Edirard  IV.) that right which Lionel (whose heir she was) had before  the rest of that Eoyal stem. So that Lancaster derived  itself from the fourth brother ; York, frona the blood of the  third and fifth united. And in time of the Sixth Henry was  this fatal and enduring misery over England, about deter-  mination of these titles, first conceived in thirtieth of his  reign by Richard Duke of York, whose son Edward IV. de-  posed Henry some nine years after; and having reigned near  like space, was also, by readoption of Henry, deprived for a  time, but restored and died of it possessed, in whose family  it continued until after death of Richard III. Hairy Earl of  Richmond and heir of Lancaster marrpng Elizabeth the heir  of York made that happy union. Some have referred the  utmost root^ of the Lancastrian title to Edmund, indeed  eldest son to Henry HI. but that by reason of his unfit de-  formity, his younger brother Edivard had the succession,  which is absurd and false.

Defender of the Faith   When amongst those turbulent commotions of Lutherans  and Itomanists under Charles V. such oppositions increased,  that the Pope's three crowns even tottered at such argu-  ments as were published against his Pardons, Mass, Monastic  profession, and the rest of such doctrine; this King Henry^  (that Luther might want no sorts of antagonists) wrote par-  ticularly against him in defence of Pardons, the Papacy,  and of their Seven Sacraments : of which is yet remaining  the original in the Vatican^ at Eome, and with the King's  own hand thus inscribed,   Anglorum Rex, HENRICUS, LEONI X.   mittit hoc Opus, etfidei testem   et amiciticB*   Hereupon, this Leo sent him the title of Defender of tlie  Faith\ : which was as ominous to what ensued.

Great Andredswalde sometime-     All that maritime tract comprehending Siissex, and part  of Kent (so much as was not mouutains, now called the  Downs, which in Britixh,^ old Gaulish, Low Dutch, and our  English signifies but Hills) being all woody, was called  Andredsiveald,^ i.e., Andred's ivood, often mentioned in our  stories, and Neicenden in Kent by it Andredcester (as most  learned Camden upon good reason guesses) whence perhaps  the Wood had his name. To this day we call those woody  lands, by North the Downs, the Weald : and the channel of  the River that comes out of those parts, and discontinues  tbe Downs about Brambcr, is yet known in Shorham Ferry,  by the name of IFeald-dich ; and, in another Saxon word  equivalent to it, are many of the parishes' terminations on  this side the Downs, that is, Herst, or Hurst, i.e., a wood.

Of all men, Gm-opiits'^  had somewhat a violent conjecture, when he derived Haron-  dell, from a people called Charudes (in Ptolemy, towards the  utmost of the now Juitkmd) part of whom he imagines  (about the Saxon and Danish irruptions) planted themselves  here, and by difference of dialect, left this as a branch  sprung of their Country title.   432.

Medway, with her attending Streams,  Goes forth to meet her Lord, great Tames :  And where in breadth she her disperses,  Our famous Captains she rehearses,  With many of their valiant deeds.  Then with Kent's pi-aise the Muse proceeds ;  And tells when Albion o'er sea rode.  How he his daughter-Isles bestow' d ;  And how grim Goodwin /oa?ns and frets:  Wliere to this Song, an end she sets.   UR Argas scarcely yet delivered of lier son,   When as the River down through Andredsweald   doth run :  Xor can the aged Hill have comfort of her child.  For, living in the woods, her Bother wax6d wild ;  His banks with aged oaks, and bushes overgrown, 5   That from the Sijlvans' kind, he hardly could be known :  Yea, many a time the Nymphs, which hapt this Flood to see,  Fled from him, whom they sure a Satyr thought to be ;   17-2      2G0 POLY-OLBION,   As Satyr-like he held all pleasures in disdain,   And would not once vouchsafe to look upon a Plain ; lo   Till chancing in his course to view a goodly plot,   Which Albion in his youth upon a Sea-Nymph got.   For O.mey's love he pines : who being wildly chaste,   And never woo'd before, was coy to be imbrac'd.   But, what obdurate heart was ever so perverse, is   Whom yet a lover's plaints, with patience, could not piercel   For, in this conflict she being lastly overthrown,   In-isl6d in his arms, he clips her for his own.   Who being gross and black, she lik'd the Kiver well.   Of Bother's happy match, when Eumncy Marsh heard tell,  Whilst in his youthful course himself he doth apply, 21   And falleth in her sight into the sea at liije,  She thinketh with herself, how she a way might find  To put the homely Isle quite out of Bother's mind ;  ^Appearing to the Flood, most bravely like a Queen, 25   Clad all from head to foot, in gaudy summer's green ;  Her mantle richly wrought, with sundry flowers and weeds ;  Her moistful temples bound, with wreaths of quivering reeds :  AMiich loosely flowing doAvn, upon her lusty thighs,  Most strongly seem to tempt the River's amorous eyes, so  And on her loins a frock, with many a swelling pleat,  Emboss'd with well-spread horse, large sheep, and full-fed   neat,  Some wallowing in the grass, there lie awhile to batten ;  Some sent away to kill; some thither brought to fatten;  AVith villages amongst, oft powthred lu^re and there; 35  And (that the same more like to laudskip* should ap-  pear)  With lakes and lesser fords, to mitigate the heat  (In summer when the fly doth prick the gadding neat,   ' A description of Jimnnri/ Marsh.   * The natural expressing of the surface of a countiy in painting.

The soul is said deform'd : and she, extremely black.  And though her rich attire, so curious be and rare,  From her there yet proceeds unwholesome putrid air : 50  Where my complexion more suits with the higher grouml,  Upon the lusty JFeald, where strength still doth abound.  The Wood-gods I refus'd, that sued to me for grace,  Me in thy wat'ry arms, thee suff 'ring to imbrace ;  Where, to great Neptune she may one day be a prey : 55  The Sea-gods in her lap lie wallowing every day.  And what, though of her strength she seem to make no doubt ?  Yet put unto the proof she'll hardly hold him out.   With this persuasive speech which Oxney lately us'd.  With strange and sundry doubts, whilst Bother stood confus'd.  Old Andredsweald* at length doth take her time to tell ei  The changes of the world, that since her youth befell.  When yet upon her soil, scarce human foot had trode ;  A place where only then, the Sylvans made abode.  Where, fearless of the hunt, the hart securely stood, 65   And everywhere walk'd free, a burgess of the wood ;  Until those Danish routs, whom hunger starv'd at home,  (Like wolves pursuing prey) about the world did roam.

Amongst these famous men, of us deserving most, 400  In these of great'st report, we gloriously prefer.

Then, as if powerful Heaven our part did there abet,  Stdl did one noble spirit, a nobler spirit beget.  So, Salsbwy arose ; from whom, as from a source  All valour seem'd to flow, and to maintain her force. 430  From whom not all their forts could hold our treacherous  Ponfmelance he regain'd, wliich ours before did lose.

As though his hand had held a more than earthly power ;  Took Stuart in the field, and General Vuntadour,  The French and Scottish force, that day which bravely led ;  Where few at all escap'd, and yet the wounded fled. 440  Mount Aguilon, and Mouns, great Salsbury surpris'd :  § What time (I think in hell) that instrument^ devis'd,  The first appear'd in France, as a prodigious birth  To plague the wretched world, sent from the envious earth;  Whose very roaring seem'd the mighty round to shake, 445  As though of all again it would a chaos make.

All men of great command, and highly that deserv'd :   Courageous Ramston next, so faithfully that serv'd  At Paris, and S, James de Beneon, where we gave  The French those deadlj' foils, that ages since deprave 470  The credit of those times, with these so wondrous things.   The memory of which, great JVarivick forward brings.  Who (as though in his blood he conquest did inherit,  Or in the very name there were some secret spirit)  Being chosen for these wars in our great Regent's place 475  (A deadly foe to France, like his brave Roman race)  The Castilets of Loyre, of Maid, and of LvMd,  Mountdtthlian, and the strong Pounforson beat to ground.

And having over-spread all Pkarcly with war,  Proud Burgainc to the field he lastly sent to dare,  Which with his English friends so oft his faith had broke :  Whose countries he made mourn in clouds of smould'ring  smoke : 500   Then Gysors he again, then did Saint Denise, raze.

Strong Fastolph Avith this man compare we justly maj^,  By Salsbury who oft being seriously imploy'd  In many a brave attempt, the general foe annoy'd ; sso   With excellent success in Alain and Anjou fought :  And many a bulwark there into our keeping brought ;  And, chosen to go forth with Vadamont in war,  Most resolutely took proud Renate, Duke of Barre.   The valiant Dmytons then, Sir Fuchard and Sir John, 535  By any English spirits yet hardly over-gone ;  The fame they got in France, with costly wounds that bought :  In Gascony and Guym, who oft and stoutly fought.   Then, valiant Matthew Gough: for whom the English were  Much bound to noble Wales in all our battles there, 540  Or sieging or besieg'd that never fail'd our force,  Oft hazarding his blood in many a desperate course.  He beat the Bastard Balme with his selected band.  And at his castle-gate surpris'd him hand to hand.  And spite of all his power away him prisoner bare. 545   Our hardy Burdet then with him we will compare,  Besieg'd within Saint James de Beneon, issuing out,  Crying ' Salsbury, S. George,' with such a horrid shout,  That cleft the wand'ring clouds ; and with his valiant crew  Upon the envied Frenclo like hungry lions flew, 550   And Arthur Earl of Eurc and Bichmont took in fight :  Tlien following them (in heat) the army put to flight :  The Britan, French, and Scot, receiv'd a general sack,  As, flying, one fell still upon another's back ;  '\\'here our six hundred slew so many thousands more. 55.0  At our so good success that once a French-man swore     TEE EIGHTEEXTH SONG. 277   That God was wholly turn'd unto the English side,  And to assist the French, the Devil had deni'd.   Then here our Kerrill claims his room amongst tlie rest,  Who justly if compar'd might match our very best. ooo   He in our wars in France with our great Talbot oft,  With Willoughhj and Scales, now down, and then aloft,  Endur'd the sundry turns of often-varying Fate :  At Cleremonf seiz'd the Earl before his city gate,  Eight hundred faithless French who took or put to sword ;  And, by his valour, twice to Artoyse us restor'd. 566   In this our service then great Arondell doth ensue.  The Marshal Bousack who in Beuroys overthrew ;  And, in despite of France and all her power, did win *  The Castles Darle, Kellay, S.

That Limen then was imm'd     So the Author conjectures ; that Bother's mouth was the  place called Liitirn, at which the Danes in time of King  Alfred made irruption ; which he must (I think) maintain  by adding likelihood that Bother then fell into the Ocean  about With ; where (as the relics of the name in Lime, and  the distance from Canterbury in Antoninus, making Portus  Lernanis,* which is misprinted in Surita's edition, Pontem  Lemanis, sixteen miles oft) it seems Limen was ; and if  Bother were Limen, then also, there was it discharged out of   • Lemannis in Natit.

Henry of Huntingdon names  no River at all, but lands them ad Portum Limene cum 250  navibus, qui portus est in orientall p)arte Cent juxta magnum  nemvs Andredslaige.t How Eother's mouth can be properly,  said in the East (but rather in the South part) of Kent, I  conceive not, and am of the adverse part, thinking clearly  that Hifh must be Portus Lemanis, which is that coast, as  also learned Camden teaches, whose authority cited out of  Huntingdon, being near the same time with Florence might  be jjtrhaps thought but as of equal credit ; therefore I call  another witness^ (that lived not much past fifty years after  the arrival) in these words, In Limneo portu constituunt pup-  'pes, 5l{JoltJre (so I read, for the print is corrupted) loco con-  dieto orientali Cantiie parte, dcstruuntque ibi pirisco opere castrum  propter quod rustica manus exigua cpdppe intrinsecus erat, Illic-  que kiberna castra confirmant.X Out of which you note both  that no River, but a Port only, is spoken of, and that the   * The Danes with 250 sail, came into the mouth of tho River  Limen, which runs out of Andredmnald: from whence four miles into  the wood they got in their ships, and built them a fort at Aphdore.  893. t At Port Limen by Andredswald in the East of Kent.   ^ Ethelwerd. lib. 4. cap. 4.

The Avords of  this Ethelicerd I respect much more than these later Stories,  and I would advise my reader to incline so with me.   442. JFJiat time I think in liell that instrument devised.   He means a Gnn ; wherewith that most noble and right  martial Thoinaa Montague Earl of Salislniri/ at the siege of  Orleans in time of Hen. VI. was slain. The first inventor of  them (I guess you dislike not the addition) was one Berthold  Swartz^ (others say Constantine AnUitzen a Dutch ]\Ionk and  Ch}Tnist, who having in a mortar sulphurous powder fur  medicine, covered with a stone, a spark of fire by chance  falling into it, fired it, and the flame removed the stone ;  which he observing, made use afterward of the like in little  pipes of iron, and showed the use to the Venetians in their  war with the Genowayes at Chioggia about 1380. Thus is  the common assertion : but I see as good authority,^ that it  was used above twenty years before in the Danish Seas. I  Avill not dispute the conveniency of it in the world, compare  it with Sah/ioneiis imitation of thunder, Archimedes his en-  gines, and such like ; nor tell you that the Chinois had it,  and Printing, so many ages before us, as Mendoza, Moffy,  and others deliver ; but not with persuading credit to all  their readers.   720.

Of  this opinion is the late Ferstegan, as you may read in him ;  and for examination of it, our great light of antiquity Cam-  den hath proposed divers considerations, in which, experience  of particulars must direct. Howsoever this was in truth, it  is as likely, for ought I see, as that Cyprus was once joined  to Syria, Evhcea (now Xecjroponf) to Buotia, Atalantc to Eu-  hcea, Belbicum to Bithynia, Leucosia to Thrace, as is affirmed :-  and Sicily (whose like our Island is) was certainly broken off  from the Continent o{ Italy, as both Virgil expressly, Strabo,  and Pliny deliver ; and also the names of Iihegium, 'xaoa 70  \rr/yM(s^a.i^ and of the self Sicily ; which, rather than from  secare,* I derive from sicilire,^ which is of the same signifi-  cation and nearer in analogy : Clauclian calls the Isle   cliducta Britannia munch,*     and Virgil hath   toto clivisos orhe Britannos ;t   Where Servius is of opinion, that, for this purpose, the  learned Poet used that phrase. And it deserves inquisition,  how beasts of rapine, as foxes and such like, came first into'  this Island (for England and JTalcs, as now Scotland and Ire-  land, had store of wolves, until some three hundred years  since) if it were not joined to a firm land, that either by  like conjunction, or narrow passage of swimming might re-  ceive them from that Continent where the Ark rested,  Avhich is Armenia. That men desired to transport them, is   ^ Sam. Beulan. ad. Nennium. ^ Plin. Hist. Nat. 2. cap. 88.   ^ From hreaking uS. TiMi^us. Ilist. 4. et Strab. a.   * To cut oil'.

To explain it, T thus English you a fragment of an old  Monk :- JVhen the Norman Conqueror had the day, he came  to Dover Castle, that he might with the same subdue Kent also;  where/are, Stigand Archbishop, a'/id Egelsin Abbot, as the chief  of that Shire, observing that now lohereas heretofore no Villeins  (the Latin is Nullus fuerat servus, and applying it to our Law-  phrase, I translate it) had been in Englaml, they should be noiv  all in bondage to the Normans, they assembled all the County,  and showed the imminent dangers, the insolence of the Normans,  and the hard condition of Villenage : They, resolving all rather  to die than lose their freedom, liurpose to encounier^icith the Duke  for their Country's liberties. Their Co.ptabis are the Archbishop  and tlie Abbot. Upon an appointed day they meet all at Swanes-  comb, and harbouring themselves in tJie woods, with boughs in  every man's hand, they encompass his way. The next day, the  Duke coming by Swanescomb, seemed to see with amazement,  as it were a ivood approaching towards him, the Kentish men at  tiie sound of a trumpet take themselves to arms, when presently  the Archhisliop awl Abbot were sent to the Duke and saluted him  with tliese words : JSehold, Sir Duke, the Kentish men come to  meet you, willing to receive you as their liege Lord, upon that con-  dition, that tliey may for ever enjoy their ancient Liberties and  Laws used among their ancestors ; othcncise, pirescnUy offering  war; being ready rather to die, than undergo a yoke of Jjondage,   ' .ToHe])h.

The Norman in this narroiv jnnch,  not so willinghj, as luisely, granted the desire: ami hostages given  on both sides, the Kentish men direct the Normans to Eochester,  and deliver them the County and the Castle of Dover. Hither  is commonly referred the retaining of ancient liberties in  Kent. Indeed it is certain that special customs they have  in their Gavelkind (although now many of their gentlemen's  possessions^ are altered in that part) svffering for Felony  without forfeiture of estate, and such like, as in particular,  with many other diligent traditions you have in Lamhard's  Perambulation : yet the report of Thomas Spot is not, me-  thinks, of clear credit, as well by reason that no warrant of  the historians about the Conquest affirms it (and this Monk  lived under Edward I.) as also for his comnaixture of a  fauxete about Villenage, saying it was not in England before  that time, which is apparantly false by divers testimonies.
