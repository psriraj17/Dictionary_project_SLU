On August 2, 2018, Apple made history by becoming the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at $1 trillion, as measured by market capitalization.1﻿ In August of 2020, the company broke records again by becoming the first U.S. company to reach a $2 trillion market cap.2﻿ Apple (AAPL) hovered just below that level as of early October 2020.

Since 2010, Apple has been one of the most valuable companies in the world.3﻿ It stayed at or near the top for many years after that.4﻿ The reason Apple is so highly valued is simple on the surface: the company makes popular products with generous margins. However, a curious reader who digs a little deeper will find mistakes, overthrown CEOs, and much more. In this article, we’ll look at the story behind Apple’s success.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1977, introducing first the Apple I and then the Apple II.
Apple went public in 1980, but Jobs eventually left—only to triumphantly return several years later.
Apple's success lies in a strategic vision that transcended simple desktop computing to include mobile devices and wearables.
Both performance and design are key drivers of the Apple brand and its ongoing success.
From Apple I to Steve Jobs 2.0
Understanding why Apple became so successful requires looking back at its origins and history. From the first Apple computer (the Apple I, which was just a motherboard without a monitor or keyboard) to the latest iWatch, here is a brief overview of the chronology of Apple's innovative products.

Apple, founded by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, started out in the business of kit computers with the Apple I.5﻿ This initial production run is popular as a collectible now. However, it will mainly be remembered for helping the company get enough capital to build the Apple II in 1977—the same year Apple officially incorporated.6﻿ Wozniak primarily built both these computers, and Jobs handled the marketing side.7﻿

The Apple II drove the company’s revenue until the mid-1980s, despite the hardware remaining largely the same. Apple attempted updates like the Apple III and the Apple Lisa, but these failed to catch on commercially. Although the Apple II was still selling, Apple as a company was in trouble when the 1980s began.

The 1984 release of the Macintosh was a leap forward for Apple. However, in the intervening years between the Apple II and the Macintosh, IBM had caught up. Disappointing revenues from the Macintosh and internal struggles for control led to Apple's board dismissing Jobs in favor of John Sculley (some sources say Jobs decided to leave).8﻿

In any case, Jobs worked on NeXT Inc. after leaving Apple. Under Sculley, Apple started growing its product lines.

Sculley served as Apple’s CEO until 1993.9﻿ During those years, Apple enjoyed strong growth. It created new products, including laser printers, Macintosh Portable, PowerBooks, the Newton, and much more. Apple products continued to sell at a premium, so the margins were generous for Apple and led to strong financial results. During the same period, however, cheaper computers running Windows were serving a far larger middle market, while Windows also benefited from powerful Intel processors. By comparison, Apple seemed to be stalling.

Two CEOs, Michael Spindler and Gil Amelio, failed to turn the tide against the relentless spread of systems running Microsoft operating systems.10﻿ Microsoft's new operating system, Windows, was becoming the industry standard, and the Apple Macintosh was showing signs of age. Amelio eventually set about addressing some of these issues by buying NeXT Inc.—the company run by none other than Apple founder Steve Jobs.

The Second Chance CEO
From the Macintosh onward, Apple has either been a reflection of or a reaction to Steve Jobs. In the Macintosh, Apple was trying to create a machine that made computing simple and enjoyable. In particular, Jobs was out to create a user experience that would convince everyone to buy a Mac.

Jobs believed a truly revolutionary product couldn't depend on customers’ needs and wants. He thought customers could not understand the value of a product until they were actually using it. Unfortunately, Jobs was ahead of his time in 1985—precisely 12 years ahead of his time.

When Jobs overthrew Amelio and took Apple's reins once more in 1997, the hardware had caught up to his vision for all things digital. He launched the iMac with a strong marketing campaign featuring the "Think Different" slogan. Although Jobs is often given credit for spending the money and time on marketing, excellent marketing and branding have always been key to Apple's growth. The real difference between the iMac and all the products preceding it was the beauty and design.

It was not a tower and monitor setup like every other PC on the market. The iMac almost looked like a racer’s helmet photographed at speed, a colorful blur sweeping back from the screen. In 1998, the iMac was the most aesthetically pleasing machine on the market. It was the computer no one knew they wanted until they saw it. It was elegant and, thanks to the OS upgrade, it was user-friendly.

The iEcosystem
The iMac was just the start as Apple released a string of hit products that reflected the new focus on elegance and user experience. These included the iBook, the iPod, the iPhone, the MacBook Air, and the iPad. The iPod became the category killer in MP3 players, and the iPhone essentially launched and then dominated the smartphone market. The iPad then somehow convinced millions of people that they needed yet another screen to consume content.

All these devices were perceived as being better in quality—and certainly in design—than competing products. Jobs was relentless on design and indoctrinated the entire culture of Apple into the art of design.

The other point he brought Apple back to in his second tenure is the ease of use. After a few minutes of using the wheel on an iPod or tapping icons on an iPad, these new forms of control became part of the simplicity that makes Apple appealing. Now every product update from Apple is anticipated by the media and the general public, in addition to the fans that the company had from the start.

More importantly, all of these products moved Apple into a new business model of creating a tight ecosystem of hardware, software, and content. Apple didn't create iTunes to be a simple program for users to transfer MP3s onto iPods, as was the case with many other manufacturers' offerings. Instead, the company attacked the concept of an album by breaking them into songs that would be sold individually at a fraction of the whole album's price.

The same process took place with software. Many popular computer functions could be done on Apple's mobile devices using stripped-down apps—available, of course, on Apple's App Store.

Being the first big mover into many of these markets, Apple built the stadium and set the rules for the game. When you pay for books, movies, apps, or music on an Apple device, Apple gets a cut. Of course, this business doesn't generate as much revenue as selling an iPhone or an iPad, where the markup is much more generous.

That said, it is the content you buy through Apple that locks many people into buying Apple again when their i-devices get old. So the content part of the ecosystem pays off for Apple in the short-term and the long-term. Once you migrate to Apple because of the design or the simplicity, it is the integration with your content that keeps you there.

The Post-Jobs Era
Steve Jobs died in 2011 of pancreatic cancer.11﻿ Serving as CEO until shortly before his death, Steve Jobs turned the reins of the company over to Tim Cook.12﻿ The post-Jobs era at Apple has nonetheless been a success by most measures. Apple continued to be the dominant tech company in both market share and stock price.

Some analysts feel that without Jobs as the creative force, Apple has become solely iterative in its tech releases rather than transformative. The major release of the post-Jobs era has been the Apple Watch. The firm also created Apple TV devices and launched the Apple TV+ streaming video-on-demand service to go with it.

In the absence of a groundbreaking new product, Apple is heavily reliant on the iPhone's production cycle to power its financial success. Critics say that without Steve Jobs at the helm, Apple has lost its innovative edge in recent years and is riding on its brand to drive sales.

The company still produced some of the best products with the most integrated ecosystem. However, the gap between Apple and competitors like Samsung and Google was no longer as pronounced as it once was. Indeed, companies like Samsung were increasingly poised to take the lead when it comes to product innovation in some categories.

Apple in the 20s
Apple's market capitalization reached new highs in 2020, as the company enjoyed some successes and set new goals for the future. The company's revenue from wearable technology, such as the Apple Watch, set new records.13﻿ Apple's revenue from services also rose to record highs during the coronavirus pandemic, as contactless payment options like Apple Pay became more popular.

Apple also announced two major changes to the Mac in 2020.14﻿ First, Apple is transitioning the Mac away from Intel processors to its own custom-designed chips. Apple's new processors are based on the ones used in iPhones and iPads, making them more energy-efficient. The new chips have the potential to give Apple's laptops longer battery life and more processing power than PCs.

Secondly, Apple is changing the macOS so that developers can make iOS and iPadOS apps run on the Mac without modifications. That will dramatically expand the number of apps available on the Mac and make it more competitive with PCs.

The Bottom Line
There is a fairly good chance that you are reading this article either on an Apple device or with one near you. Maybe you are doing it on a MacBook Air while listening to an iPod touch and occasionally glancing at the newest Apple Watch for alerts from your iPhone. The reason behind that—and behind Apple’s success—is that its devices are beautiful to look at and a pleasure to use. That's why the company has such a powerful brand and lofty stock valuation.

The marketing helps, and the media and fan frenzy never hurt. However, it is the quality of the products that drive Apple's success. Add to this the iEcosystem that makes it much easier to stay with Apple than try something new, and you have a company with what Warren Buffett called an economic moat. It should not be surprising that Buffett invested heavily in Apple.



U.K. antitrust authorities opened a probe into Apple Inc’s app payment rules, adding to a slew of global probes examining the control the iPhone maker holds over app developers.

The Competition and Markets Authority said it will focus on how Apple forces customers to use its own payment system for in-app purchases and will weigh the company’s potentially “dominant” position in the supply of apps on iPhones and iPads.
“Complaints that Apple is using its market position to set terms which are unfair or may restrict competition and choice -– potentially causing customers to lose out when buying and using apps -– warrant careful scrutiny,” said Andrea Coscelli, who leads the CMA.

The probe adds to growing U.S. and EU antitrust scrutiny of Apple’s rules that require apps to use its own in-app payment system. The EU is readying an escalation of its case, people with knowledge of the probe said on Thursday. Apple’s control of payments allows it to enforce a subscription fee of up to 30% for some subscription fees. The Dutch competition authority is also examining phone payments.The investigation was partially prompted by concerns from developers, the CMA said. Epic Games Inc., the maker of the Fortnite battle game, is suing Apple in the U.S. and Australia over the issue and recently lost an attempt to pursue legal action against the Apple app stores at the U.K.’s antitrust tribunal.

The Apple probe comes as the U.K. watchdog seeks to move to the forefront of tech regulation after emerging from the shadow of European Union regulators at the end of Britain’s Brexit transition. It is preparing to set up a tech-focused unit and has warned that the largest companies will face extra scrutiny of everything from mergers to monopoly behavior.

U.K. Sees More Than Just Billion-Dollar Fines for Tech Firms

Apple said in a statement that it looks forward to working with the CMA to “to explain how our guidelines for privacy, security and content have made the App Store a trusted marketplace for both consumers and developers.”


The investigation “shows the impact of Brexit,” said Damien Geradin, a lawyer representing some of the developers that filed complaints. “It gives a lot of freedom to the CMA, which now doesn’t need authorization” from the EU, he said.

Geradin said that while the CMA probe was likely to focus on in-app purchases, the regulators may broaden the scope to consider issues such as why Apple only allows one app store on its devices.
"Our goal is to fundamentally shift how developers think about building apps: Starting not with the platform you're targeting but rather with the experience you want to create. Flutter allows you to handcraft beautiful experiences where your brand and design comes to the forefront," the release said.

In the age of the smart home and connected car, people interact with applications in a number of environments via myriad devices and systems. In a press release, Google explained that Flutter 2 can be embedded in smart home appliances, TVs and cars to provide the "most pervasive and portable experience for an ambient computing world."


In 2018, Google announced Flutter, the company's UI toolkit for cross-platform app development. On Wednesday, Google announced Flutter 2, extending the toolkit to additional platforms with Flutter 2, the availability of Dart 2.12, a Google Mobile Ads for Flutter beta and more.
With Flutter 2, Developers are able to deliver apps to a total of five operating systems including iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux, and utilize web experience targeting for Firefox, Safari, Edge, or Chrome browsers, according to Google.

Flutter 2 expands the toolkit to function as a portable framework and the thousands of Flutter apps available now will receive a free Flutter 2 upgrade, "since they can now grow to target desktop and web without a rewrite," the release said.

Today, Microsoft released Flutter engine contributions offering support for foldable Android smart devices, according to Google, and it was revealed that Flutter would be the "default choice" for Canonical-created mobile and desktop apps moving forward.

"The early foundation of the web was document-centric. But the web platform has evolved to encompass richer platform APIs that enable highly-sophisticated apps with hardware-accelerated 2D and 3D graphics and flexible layout and paint APIs," the release said. 

"Flutter's web support builds on these innovations, offering an app-centric framework that takes full advantage of all that the modern web has to offer."
Google described the production-quality web support as "perhaps the single largest announcement" with Flutter 2. The initial release focuses on a few scenarios such as progressive web apps (PWAs), which combines "the web's reach with the capabilities of a desktop app," single-page apps (SPAs) "that load once and transmit data to and from internet services," and delivering existing mobile Flutter apps for the web, according to the release.

Google Mobile Ads for Flutter and plug-in updates
Google also announced a beta release of a new software developer kit (SDK) called Google Mobile Ads for Flutter. This SDK functions with AdMob and AdManager to offer "a variety of ad formats." The company said it piloted these capabilities with a number of "key partners" specifically naming the music platform Sua Música.

Google also announced a number of Flutter plug-in updates for Firebase services such as Authentication, Cloud Functions, Cloud Firestore, Cloud Storage, Cloud Messaging, Crashlytics, and more.

Dart: Google's "secret sauce"
Google described its programming language Dart as the "secret sauce behind Flutter" and announced the availability of Dart 2.12, which the company said was its largest release since 2.0 and includes sound null safety support, a stable implementation of FFI, and other features.
In 2020, most of us with office jobs had to shift to working from home full time and managing a not-so-good work-life balance. We all had to learn when to put the phone down and stop working, but some managed this better than others. We still regularly see co-workers, friends, and family working longer than they should.

Just because you work from home doesn't mean that your work-life balance has to take a hit. Instead, you can use tools on your iOS and macOS devices to ensure that you're able to manage your work schedule while working, but leave it at the virtual door when it's time to transition to your home life.

Here are a few great tools you can use to keep work at bay.
Enable Do Not Disturb
One of the best features for combating work creep in your personal life is Do Not Disturb. This feature is not only great when doing presentations to keep unwanted notifications from appearing, but also when you're at home, to keep work notifications and calls from coming in when you're on personal time.
Enabling Do Not Disturb is fairly easy: You can enable it in the Control Center (swipe up from the bottom of the screen on Touch ID devices, swipe down from the top right on Face ID devices) and select the moon icon. This will enable Do Not Disturb until the next day. You can also enable it and have it disable after a certain period of time or after a calendar event by long pressing on the Control Center icon for Do Not Disturb. 
Contemporary Mac SSD drives often feature less storage than did their mechanical predecessors. Although cloud-computing and iCloud adoption rates have increased and shifted some of the burden for storing application data, documents, spreadsheets, presentations, photographs and videos to data centers, Mac users still commonly run short on disk space. With many Macs—including several popular models of iMacs, MacBook Airs, MacBook Pros and Mac minis—shipping with just 256GB SSDs, it's important to maintain tidy drives.

But just how should you free space when a Mac runs short on storage?
Using a trusted application uninstaller—Pocket Bits' App Uninstaller and MacPaw's CleanMyMac X are two options—to remove no longer needed programs is a smart first step. If, after running the macOS storage management utility—accessed by clicking the Apple logo from a Mac's menu bar, selecting About This Mac, highlighting the Storage tab and clicking the Manage button—to remove unwanted photos, movies and other unwanted files and finding still more free space is required, check out Erwin Bonsma's GrandPerspective app available within Apple's App Store for just $2.99. The compact 3MB app punches above its weight class and simplifies the challenge of locating various files of your choosing.
