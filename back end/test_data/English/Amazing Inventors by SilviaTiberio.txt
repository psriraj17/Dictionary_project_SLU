The man who invented the printing press





I invented a machine to print books - the printing press. After my invention, books were cheaper and easier to make. Books spread ideas around the world. I started the information age. But during my life, no one valued my work.



***



I went to school in Mainz, Germany. When I was young, there were very few books because it took several weeks to make just one copy. Books were written by hand, usually by priests. They wrote with a quill - a pen made from a bird's feather - and it wasn't always easy to read their handwriting. I asked myself, 'Can I invent a machine to put words on paper?' A machine can make more books in less time.

My training as a goldsmith gave me good ideas for a printing press. I started my experiments in Strasbourg in 1436. I had a girlfriend and we were engaged, but I didn't have very much money. So I couldn't get married and do my experiments as well. I had to choose - should I get married or continue my work on my printing press? It was so hard to decide that I couldn't sleep at night. Finally, after a lot of thinking, I told my girlfriend, 'I'm really sorry, but I can't get married. I need the money for my experiments.'

It was a difficult time. In my town, people had a bad opinion of me. My girlfriend was so angry that she took me to court because I broke my promise. And I was so poor that I had to borrow money to buy materials for my experiments.

In 1440, after four years of hard work, I invented a printing press that worked. It was a wooden press with 'movable type.' To make it work, I made small metal letters and put them in a wooden block. I used the same block to make several copies of the same page. My system was called 'movable type' because you could move the letters from one place in the block to another.

I was very pleased with my invention, but businessmen weren't interested in it. In 1444, I decided to open my own workshop. I printed some poems and in 1448, I printed the calendar for the year. I earned some money, but I couldn't pay off my debts.



***



In 1450, I met Johann Fust, a rich man who gave me 8,000 guilders. His daughter's husband, Peter Schoffer, started to work with me in my business. Soon my printing press was working again. I did some small jobs - for example, I printed some poems.

Next, I wanted to do something big, so I borrowed more money from Fust and printed the 'Gutenberg Bible.' It was a very beautiful book with 42 lines per page. But the cost of making each bible was much higher than the money I got for selling it. Soon my money problems were much bigger than before. My debt was very big now - 20,000 guilders.

My situation was very bad, but things got worse when, in 1455, Fust took me to court. He said, 'Gutenberg borrowed some money from me to print books and used it to pay for other things!' This was not true, but to my surprise, he won the case!

In one day, I lost everything - my workshop, my machine and all my materials! The court gave them all to Fust. He used my printing press to open a new printing company with Schoffer. Without my machine, I couldn't work or pay off my debts.

After several years, I started printing again, but there was a lot of competition then. There were more than 100 printing companies in Germany and there were printing companies in France and Spain, too. And they all used my idea - the movable type system.

My machine changed the world, but no one thought my work was useful during my life. The printing press was a very important invention. With books, people could read and learn. With books, people could share political ideas and ideas about technology. My printing press started the information age.

Louis Braille

1809-1852

The man who invented an alphabet for the blind





I became blind when I was a child. There were very few books for people who couldn't see. It was very difficult for us to learn how to read and write. We needed an easy system. Could I invent one?



***



When I was a child, I was curious, like most boys. My father had a workshop and made harnesses for horses. He had a lot of tools that I was interested in. One day, I picked up an awl - a very sharp tool - from my father's table and I started playing with it. Suddenly, I tripped and fell. The awl hurt my eye badly. The doctor tried to help me, but my eye became infected. Soon my other eye became infected, too. I was 5 years old when I couldn't see the sun, the fields or the blue sky anymore.

We lived in Coupvray, a small town east of Paris. At school, I couldn't run or play with the other boys. It was difficult to learn because I couldn't read or write. My teacher and the local priest tried hard to teach me, but I didn't make much progress. I was slower than the other children in the class.

My parents were very worried about my future. They didn't want me to become a beggar. They wanted me to study. One day, my father heard of Quinze-Vingts, a school for blind people in Paris, and decided to take me there.

I was 10 years old and full of hope when I arrived at the school. 'Do you have books for a blind person?' was my first question to Doctor Guille, the doctor in charge of the school. I was pleased to hear that they had. 'This is the right place for me,' I thought. But soon I found out that life at Quinze-Vingts was very hard.

The school wasn't a pleasant place. The building was 500 years old and the rooms were cold and damp. And Doctor Guille wasn't a pleasant man. He was a cruel man who hit his students and used very unkind words to describe blind people. I was very upset.

At Quinze-Vingts, students weren't taught how to read or write. Doctor Guille wasn't interested in that. We were taught how to make baskets, chairs and slippers. For Doctor Guille, we weren't students. We were workers! He sold the beautiful things that we made! I was sad, lonely and a long way from home. My parents didn't know that my life was so hard.

Although the school was bad, it was the only place that had books for blind people. The books were large, heavy and expensive. The letters were raised from the page and I felt them with my fingers. The problem was that I took a very long time to read each word. When I got to the end of the sentence, I couldn't remember the beginning. But I wanted to read. There were 14 books in the school and I decided to read them all.



Things got better when, in 1821, Doctor Pignier became the director of the school. We started to have music lessons. I loved to play music and it became my favourite hobby. It was much easier than reading because I didn't need to read music. I could play by ear. I was asked to play at many churches in Paris. It was good to be outside the school. People said nice things to me. I was paid for my work and I had my own money for the first time in my life. This meant a lot to me.



***



When I was 12 years old, Charles Barbier, who worked for the army, visited our school. He told us about the system that his army used to read in the dark. They couldn't use light because the enemy might see them, so they used a system with 12 dots and dashes. The system was difficult, but it gave me an idea.



When I returned home for a holiday, I started working on my idea. I went to my father's workshop and picked up an awl - the tool that hurt my eye - to invent a new system for reading and writing. I used the awl to raise dots on a page. Barbier's system had 12 symbols. My system was easier. It had only six. In 1824, I was 15 years old and I had a basic system. Five years later, the first book was published. It was called 'Method of Writing Words and Music and Plain Songs by Means of Dots, for Use by the Blind and Arranged for Them.' The system was called the Braille System.



I was very happy with my system, but most teachers didn't want to use it. They weren't blind and they didn't need it. They preferred the old system with raised letters because they didn't want to learn something new. But I continued to use it and started to teach people to use it. In 1834, it was shown at an exhibition in Paris.

I became a teacher at my old school. My students made progress quickly and this made me very happy. But I was ill and I began to feel very weak. The damp conditions in the school weren't good for my health. The doctor said that I had tuberculosis and in 1844, I had to stop teaching.

But my students continued to use my system. And then, little by little, the system spread to other schools and other parts of the world. It became the reading and writing system for the blind. My students kept the Braille System alive!



The Life of Louis Braille:

1809 - Louis Braille was born in Coupvray, France.

1812 - He had an accident with an awl and hurt one of his eyes. Both eyes became infected. He was 5 years old and he became blind.



1815 - Father Jacques Palluy from the Coupvray Catholic church helped with Louis' education.



1819 - Louis went to Paris to study at the Royal Institute for Blind Youth (Quinze-Vingts).

1821 - Charles Barbier visited the school and talked about his system for reading in the dark. Louis had the idea to invent his own system.

1824 - He showed his work to Doctor Pignier, the Director at the National Institute for Blind Youth.

1826 - He finished school and became an assistant teacher at the same school.

1828 - He became a teacher.

1829 - He published his book 'Method of Writing Words, Music and Plain Songs by Means of Dots, for Use by the Blind and Arranged for Them.'

1834 - He showed his system at the Paris Exhibition of Industry.

1835 - He became ill with tuberculosis.

1837 - The second edition of the Braille system was published.

1843 - The Royal Institute for Blind Youth was moved to a better building.

1844 - Louis stopped teaching.

1852 - Louis died of tuberculosis when he was 43 years old.

1847-1922

The man who invented the telephone





I was always interested in sounds. My mother was deaf and my father taught deaf people. I was creative and enjoyed inventing things. I did a lot of experiments and one day, I invented the telephone.



***



I was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. When I was a child, I liked to learn new things. I liked art, poems and music, and I could play the piano very well.



I invented my first machine when I was 12 years old. I had a friend and his father had a mill. One day, we were playing together in the mill, when my friend's father told us, 'Why don't you do something useful?' 'That's a good idea,' I thought, and I invented a new machine. My friend's father was very surprised. The machine could separate the outside parts of wheat grains from the inside parts. The machine could do the job quickly and easily.



I left school when I was 15 years old because I wasn't interested in school lessons. My father was worried about my decision because he thought education was very important. He was a professor at Edinburgh University and worked on 'Visible Speech', a system to teach deaf people.



I was interested in my father's work, maybe because my mother was deaf. One day, I read a book that gave me an idea - that it was possible to use electricity to produce sound. I decided to work on that.



***



But hard times came. Between 1867 and 1870, two of my brothers became ill with tuberculosis and died. I also became ill and I was very weak. My father thought that our family needed a new start and one day, he made a decision. 'We're going to move to Canada,' he said.

I was 23 years old when we sailed across the Atlantic Ocean. When we were there, my father bought a farmhouse in Ontario. Life on the farm was good for my health and it helped me feel stronger. In Ontario, I met the Indians from the Six Nations Reserve, learnt their language and used my father's system to help the deaf people in their community. They were so happy that they named me honorary chief. To celebrate, I put on their clothes and danced. It was great fun!



In 1871, my father and I started teaching deaf people in Montreal. My father was such a good teacher that he received an invitation to work in Boston in the USA. We travelled there and opened a school to train teachers of the deaf. Suddenly, my life became very busy. I spent six months in Boston and the rest at home in Ontario. I started my research on sounds and electricity. I did most of my research on my own at night and I was so tired that I often had terrible headaches. In 1875, when Thomas Watson became my assistant, I finally got some help.



***



One day, I met a man who was very important in my life. His name was Antonio Meucci. He showed me his invention, a basic telephone with one line to carry signals. His invention gave me an idea. Soon I started doing experiments to invent a telephone with more than one line.

On 2nd June 1875, my telephone worked for the first time. I was at one end of the line in one room and Watson was at the other end of the line in another room. 'Watson. Come here. I want to see you.' And Watson came to see me! This was the start of a revolution that changed the world. I got a patent for my telephone. It was patent number 174,465.

After that, I decided to work hard on my new invention. I didn't have much time to work as a teacher, so I only had two students and one of them was Mabel Hubbard. Mabel was deaf, but she could read your lips and speak, and she later became my wife. Her father was a friend of mine.

Mr Hubbard was interested in my work and gave me money for my experiments. With his help, I invented a new telephone that could send messages more than five miles. I offered it to the company Western Union, but their president said it was a toy. The American government said, 'This telephone isn't useful. And it will be dangerous in people's homes.'

I decided to start my own company without help from businessmen or the government. In 1877, I started the Bell Telephone Company with Mr Hubbard. In 1881, I started the Volta Laboratory in Washington and invented many useful things. In 1885, I started a new company. I had a very busy life. I was a successful inventor and businessman!



The Life of Alexander Graham Bell:

1847 - Alexander Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland.

1858 - His father gave him the middle name of 'Graham' on his 11th birthday.

c.1859 - He built a machine that could separate the outside parts of wheat grains from the inside parts. He became interested in 'Visible Speech', a system that his father used for helping deaf people.

1867 - His brother, Edward, died of tuberculosis. Alexander became ill.



1870 - His brother, Melville, also died of tuberculosis. The Bell family moved to Canada. He and his father later opened a school in Boston, USA.



1873 - Mabel Hubbard, his future wife, became his student. She was the daughter of Gardiner Greene Hubbard.

1875 - Thomas Watson became his assistant. Bell's telephone worked for the first time.

1876 - He got a patent for a telephone that could send a message more than five miles.

1877 - He formed the Bell Telephone Company. He married Mabel Hubbard and they moved to the UK for 15 months. They later had two daughters and two sons.

1881 - He invented the metal detector - an instrument to find metal. He started the Volta Laboratory in Washington. He invented many useful things in this laboratory.

1882 - He became American.

1885 - He started the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.



1888 - The National Geographic Society was formed. He was one of the founding fathers.



1890 - He started the American Association to Promote Teaching Speech to the Deaf.

1909 - His plane, Silver Dart, was able to fly.

1915 - He made the first telephone call from one side of America to the other. Alexander was in New York and he talked on the telephone with his assistant, Watson, in San Francisco.

1919 - Alexander and Casey Baldwin invented the HD-4 hydroplane - a fast boat that travelled on the surface of the water. It was the fastest hydroplane at the time.

1922 - Alexander died in Nova Scotia, Canada. He was 75 years old.

1847-1931

The man who invented the electric light bulb





One day, I was poor. The next, I was rich. I brought light to cities and invented lots of new things. How did I do it? I worked hard. But I also had good luck. I met the right people at the right time.



***



I was born in the United States. I went to school for only three months because my teacher thought that I caused trouble in the classroom. In fact, I spoke in a loud voice because I couldn't hear very well. When I left school, I was only 7 years old. My mother became my teacher at home.

My parents had seven children and I was the youngest. We didn't have much money, so when I was 12 years old, all my brothers and sisters worked. I decided to work too. I got a job on the railways and I sold food and drinks on trains.

One day, I was at Mount Clemens station when I saw a little boy on the railway. There was a train coming and I ran to save him. The boy was the stationmaster's 3-year-old son. He wanted to thank me for saving his son and taught me how to use the telegraph. I could get a better job now!



***



From 1863 to 1867, I worked as a telegraph operator. I liked machines and I sometimes did experiments. When I was 19, I had a job at The Western Union Company in Louisville. One day, I was trying an experiment when I spilt acid in the office and lost my job. I moved to Boston and invented a machine to record votes. No one was interested in it, so when I was 22 years old, I decided to go to New York to make a new start.

I knew one person in New York so I went to see him. 'I haven't got a job and I need some money. Could I borrow some from you?' I asked. He was surprised. 'I can only lend you a dollar,' he said. I took the dollar and promised to give it back. This dollar changed my life.

I was hungry and weak, so I used the dollar to buy a meal. I felt much stronger after my meal and I went out to look for a job. I talked to a few people. One of them was Franklin Pope. He worked for The Gold Indicator Company and he showed me the company's building. I stayed in the battery room that night. The next day, I studied the company's machines. The third day was my lucky day.

There was a machine that sent important information to the Gold Exchange. Suddenly, it stopped working. The people in the company didn't know what to do. But I knew what to do. I repaired the machine. Doctor Samuel Laws, from the Gold Exchange, heard of my work. He offered to pay me 300 dollars a month to repair their machines! I was able to pay the dollar back.



Soon the president of the Gold and Stock Telegraph Company also heard of my work. 'Can you repair the machines in our company?' he asked me. 3,000 or 5,000 dollars a year was good pay for the job, but he offered me 40,000 dollars! I was lucky once again.



***



This was the start of my career as a businessman and inventor. I moved to New Jersey and I opened several telegraph companies with Franklin Pope. In 1870, Mary Stilwell got a job in one of my companies. We got married the next year and had three children. I was happy to have a family but I didn't have much time to be at home. I had a lot of ideas for new inventions. In 1876, I built a research laboratory at Menlo Park, formed a team and invented the phonograph - a machine to play music - and many other things.



My most important invention came next. Every day when the sun set, everything was dark. We had electricity but we had no electric light. After a lot of experiments and hours of hard work at the laboratory, we invented the electric light bulb - the round, glass object that produces light. In 1882, I helped to put 400 lights in the streets of Manhattan. New York got a new name, 'The City That Never Sleeps.' I brought light to homes, hospitals, offices, factories and schools. It was the beginning of the 24-7 lifestyle - 24 hours of light, seven days a week.

Then, a sad day arrived in my life. In 1884, my wife became ill and died. But two years later, I got married to Mina Miller and had three children. At work, it was a time of success. I started more companies and invented more things. I got one patent every ten days. There were 1,093 in total!

Then hard times came again. In 1913, a big fire destroyed 13 of our buildings. The next year, the First World War started in Europe. The government asked me to work on inventions to find guns and submarines. I couldn't work on my inventions anymore.

During my life, I started a lot of companies and invented many things. One day, I was asked, 'How did you do it?' My answer was, 'One per cent inspiration and 99 per cent perspiration.' Hard work was the key.



The Life of Thomas Edison:

1847 - Thomas Alva Edison was born in Ohio, USA.



1859 - When he was 12 years old, he worked on the railways. He sold food and drinks. A few years later, he produced a newspaper, the Grand Trunk Herald.

1862 - The stationmaster's son was playing on the railway and Edison saved his life. The stationmaster taught him how to use the telegraph.



1863-1867 - He travelled between cities. He worked as a telegraph operator on the Grand Trunk Railway in Ontario and for The Western Union Company. He moved to Louisville, Kentucky.

1868 - He moved to Boston. He got a patent for the Electric Vote Recorder.

Guglielmo Marconi

1874-1937

The man who invented the wireless system





I invented the radio and sent the first wireless messages across the Atlantic. My invention changed the speed of communication. I also invented radar systems. They tell us the speed, position and direction of objects which we can't see.



***



I was born in Italy. My mother was Irish and my father was Italian. When I was a child, I learnt two languages - English and Italian. I could communicate with people in two different ways. Communication was very important in my life.

When I was young, it wasn't easy to communicate with other countries. A few people used the telegraph. This machine sent electric signals through a wire between two places. I asked myself, 'Is there a better way to communicate?' 'Can one person hear another person at a distance without using a wire?' 'Can voice messages travel from one city to another?'

I wanted to find answers to my questions so I started doing experiments. I didn't attend university. I worked at home with very simple equipment and my father helped me. In 1895, I was able to send radio waves over a distance of 100 metres! I was very excited. But some scientists told me, 'It's only possible to send waves in straight lines.' They also said, 'It isn't possible if there is an object between the two places.' I didn't agree and I decided to try a new experiment.



I built a receiving station behind a hill and asked my assistant, Mr Mignani, to stay behind the hill. I gave him a gun and said, 'I'll send you a message from home. Fire this gun if you can hear me.' I went to my father's house and sent him the message. Suddenly, I heard a very loud sound. It was Mignani's gun! My discovery was very important because it was the first wireless radio message in history!



***



I needed money for my research but in Italy no one was interested in my invention. I travelled to England in 1896 and showed my radio to William Preece from the British Post Office. He was interested in my work and decided to help me. He gave me money and I did many more experiments. Soon I was able to send messages over longer distances. My invention was now ready to use.



The next year, I got a patent for wireless telegraphy and started the Wireless Telegraph and Signal Company. More and more people from business and government showed interest in my work and my life became busier and busier. In 1898, I opened the first radio factory in England with the help of some investors. In 1899, radio communication between England and France became possible. My company was growing fast and we needed more people to work in the factory. As a result, a new training college was opened in 1901. It was an exciting time.



***



My next question was, 'Can radio waves cross the Atlantic?' 'That's too far away,' many scientists said. Once again, I thought they were wrong so I tried a new experiment.

I sailed across the Atlantic to Newfoundland in Canada. When I was there, I put antennae on kites. The kites went high in the sky and helped to receive radio waves. On 12th December 1901, I got a message from Poldhu in England about 2,500 miles away. On that day, the world became smaller. The speed of communication did not depend on winds and ocean waves any more. It now depended on radio waves.

I was very lucky when I met Beatrice O'Brien. We got married on 16th March 1905, and we had three daughters and a son. It was a busy time. I was invited to Canada and Russia and received a lot of honours. In 1909, I received the Nobel Prize for Physics which I shared with Karl Braun.



In the same year, two ships, the 'SS Republic' and the 'SS Florida' collided in the North Atlantic Ocean. Rescuers received radio messages and saved 4,000 people from the ships. Three years later, 712 survivors of the 'RMS Titanic' were saved because of wireless technology. My radio system helped to save lives!



***



Soon everyone thought that my invention was very important. Communication did not depend on undersea wires or landlines any longer. My radio made communication much easier. Radio was useful for business, politics and wars, and I continued to work hard.



But sadly, the First World War started in 1914. Communication became so important that the British government took control of my company. I couldn't run my business or do research, so I decided to return to Italy. I joined the army and was responsible for the army's radio service. They were sad times. A lot of people died.

After the war, I returned to England because there was more opportunity to do business there. But I had to spend a lot of time in meetings. There was a strong connection between technology, power and business, and important people in business and government wanted to talk to me. I couldn't spend much time with my family. Our marriage ended in 1924.



I was very happy when, some years later, I met Maria Cristina Bezzi-Scali. We got married on 15th June 1927 and had a daughter three years later. I had a family again.



***



During times of peace, I found more uses for wireless technology. People had radios in their homes. Ships used special radio waves. But my most important invention of the time was a new 'Radio Detection and Ranging' system. It was called radar. Its waves could tell us the speed of objects. They could also tell us the exact position of planes and ships. I sold radar systems to different companies and governments around the world.

When I became ill, I decided to return to Italy. I wanted to spend the last years of my life in my country. I died in Rome in 1937. I made an important contribution to the world. I hope scientists will continue to develop wireless technology. I hope they will use it for the benefit of everyone.

John Logie Baird

1888-1946

The man who invented the television





I had an illness when I was a child and I had to live a quiet life. Technology became my hobby. We could send voice messages. Could I invent a system for sending pictures? I decided to try to do it.



***



I had a serious illness when I was two years old and I couldn't do sport. I began to play with technical things. I had a friend who lived across the road and I built a phone that connected his home with mine. We sent messages to each other and had great fun. I was 12 years old at the time.



At school, I wasn't a very good student. 'He doesn't learn very quickly,' my teacher told my mother. But I worked hard and finished school. Then I entered university to study electrical engineering, but I couldn't finish my studies because the First World War started.

My health was poor, so I didn't fight during the war. I worked as an engineer at Clyde Valley Electricity in Glasgow. My job was to repair the machines there. But I wasn't interested in repairing things. I was interested in making them. I enjoyed doing experiments. One day, one of my experiments went wrong and the lights went out in some parts of Glasgow. I lost my job!



***



I decided to try a new place and a new way of life. In 1919, I travelled to the island of Trinidad in the West Indies. Life was quiet on the island. The weather was so sunny that I felt much better there. I started new experiments with sounds and pictures. My neighbours heard strange noises in my house. They also saw lights that turned on and off 'He's doing some kind of magic,' they thought. The local people were afraid of me. After a year on the island, I decided that Trinidad wasn't the best place for my experiments and I sailed back to England.

I asked myself, 'We have cameras to take pictures. We have radios to send messages. Is it also possible to send pictures?' I wanted to invent a system for sending images from one place to another and I started to work on my system. My first invention was a basic machine. I did more experiments and on 2nd October 1925, I showed my television in Selfridges, a large store in London. It was the first public presentation of my experiment. In 1927, I started a company - Baird Television Limited. I also got a patent for my invention and sent television images over 438 miles. It was a very exciting time.

I borrowed some money and did more experiments. My television became better each day. In 1930, people could watch the first play on television. The next year, they could watch a horse race - the Derby. I did many things in a short period of time. But I also had a big debt. My company sold 10,000 televisions in the UK, but I needed to sell more televisions. I wanted to pay off my debt.



In 1931, I received an invitation to visit the USA. I sailed there with my girlfriend - and future wife - Margaret Albu. I knew that I could sell a lot of televisions in the USA but there was a depression at the time. In the UK, the situation wasn't any better. In 1936, the British Broadcasting Corporation (the BBC) didn't choose my system to send television programmes. Then the Second World War started in 1939. It was a very difficult time for my company.

During the war, London wasn't a safe place to live so I moved my family to Cornwall. I stayed in London because I had to work for the government. I had to help with the use of radar systems and secret codes and messages. There were many difficult days during the war and I made several long journeys to visit my family.

After the war, I decided to make a new start. I started a new company, John Logie Baird Limited, and worked very long hours. I wanted to invent colour television. But my health wasn't good and in 1946, I had a heart attack and I never recovered.

The television was a very important invention that changed education and entertainment. It changed people's lives. A lot of people use my invention. Think about the number of people around the world who watch television every day!
