GENEALOGICAL     AND     FAMILY HISTORY   OF   SOUTHERN NEW YORK   AND THE   HUDSON RIVER VALLEY   A Record of the Achievements of Her People in the Making of a  Commonwealth and the Building of a Nation     COMPILED UNDER THE EDITORIAL SUPERVISION OF   CUYLER REYNOLDS   Curator of The Albany Institute and Historical and Art Society, since 1898; Director of   New York State History Exhibit at Jamestown Exhibition, 1907; Author of   'Albany Chronicles,' 'Classified Quotations,' etc., etc.     VOL. I     ILLUSTRATED     NEW YORK   LEWIS HISTORICAL PUBLISHING COMPANY   1914     Tns     PREFACE   THE purpose of this work is in line with that of the early Egyptian who de-  picted in a decorative fashion the life history of a man upon his sarcophagus.  We have grown so familiar with this form of literature that to comment too  much upon it seems an impertinence. It is not the intent of this foreword to set  forth an excuse for the collecting of family records and the desire to preserve them in  a practical form, although many writers appear to have entertained the thought that to  do so was necessary.   A large percentage of the progress of the people of this country is directly due to  le fact that they have made a review of its record the foundation upon which to  'lild its future. The known facts have been to the individual a reliable guide, the same  3 a chart or compass is to the sailor. One may not succeed without them.   The government, corporations, firms and families have prosecuted the work of  ibulation with an amazing persistency and precision, until the person who desires to  'Iter upon an untried proposition, or who learns of a loss and would rectify it, has this   • jwerful adjunct in the way of wisdom, the epitome of experience, by which to pro-   • cd in a profitable manner. A railroad corjjoration's head has at his hand the result  f careful calculations which show the unit of loss through work and wear, or the profit   to be produced from every train which travels a mile, and upon such figures he is able  to base reliable deductions to secure increa.sed efficiency. The scientist has named  and catalogued the firmament of stars at an expense of hundreds of thousands of dollars,  though nine-tenths of the people know not the sense nor the service; men of science  have classified the rocks, plants, insects, birds and fish, whether man has ever seen or  expects to see them, regardless of whether he believes them to serve a purpose or score  a profit. All this is done that the race may advance at rapid rate, through being able  readily to reach conclusions. We must be in command of an infinite amount of infor-  mation, and it must be both accurate and accessible.   Strange and surprising would it be if the names and habits of ten thousand dis-  tinct types of species of spiders were studied, scheduled, portrayed and published,  yet no thought given to preserving in permanent printed form the names and the  deeds of human beings. Why then should we be at pains to enter the name and date  of death upon the cemetery ledger, if henceforth no one is to read and use such entry?  But if such memoranda are made, then printing them that they may be accessible is the  logical outcome. The result is known as a genealogy.   Two things establish my faith that the family record is regarded as an essential. It  is to be noted that one-third of the persons one finds studying in a library are intent  upon biography, and the librarian never fails to add to his stock of genealogies, no  matter what may be his other needs. It is true that there are many other reasons why  nearly everyone is more or less inclined to participate in the preparation and preserva-  tion of biographies. Some have a strong instinct to leave for others the same sort of     material for which they have searched, for in a peculiar sense it is eternal existence,  best expressed in the words: 'To live in hearts we leave behind is not to die.'   Verily, that person who has led a useful life yearns to live that he may give more.  But, prevented, he still has the desire to direct, to advise, admonish, and to assist  after he has gone from his unfinished task, — his toil ended when so much remained to  do. Men of this calibre, holding such thoughts, have left us their autobiographies, and  they did so as men not vain of name or fame. But their writings depict the lives of  the great.   On the other hand, we are bound to realize the fact often brought to attention, that  the judgment of some minds is to the efifect that a biography or any sort of family  record represents a vainglorious spirit and is the stamp of smallness of intellect. They  taunt the toiler in his work of rescuing records with the declaration that the person  failing to create an enduring monument by his acts is the one who is obliged to resort  to the printing of his achievements in the hope of creating a character to cover the  lack. I have never known a man who compiled his own history to be a person of that  type, nor is it supposed or intended by the preparation of this work that either emi-  nence or social standing will be enhanced, augmented or achieved.   It is a truth that like begets like, as is the father so is the son. Hence it is only  natural that a family started through the struggles of the plucky Puritan or daring  Dutchman, passing on to a period of civilization and culture, should result in a strain  of men of character and common-sense. This explains why so many men whose lives  are recorded in these pages have left a name which is as much alive to-day as ever ;  nevertheless, the purpose is to preser^'e and not promote the glamor of a man.   A person of sense, as well as the captious critic, should realize that years of perse-  verance in the arduous task of careful compilation have hallowed his work so that the  author neither conceives nor creates greatness where greatness does not exist. This  was so admirably expressed by the late Hon. Frank S. Black, Governor of New York  State, in a stirring speech delivered at Cornell University in 1909, that the editor be-  lieves nothing better could be read :   'Lincoln's greatness did not depend upon his title, for greatness was his when the title was  bestowed. He leaned upon no fiction of nobility and kissed no hand to obtain his rank ; but the stamp  of nobility and power which he wore was conferred upon him in that log hut in Kentuck-y that day in  1809, when he and Nancy Hanks were first seen there together, and it was conferred by a power which,  unlike earthly potentates, never confers a title without a character that will adorn it. When we under-  stand that tremendous advantages of a humble birtli, when we realize that the privations of youth are  the pillars of strength to maturer years, then we shall cease to wonder that out of such obscure  surroundings as watched the coming of Abraham Lincoln, should spring the colossal and supreme  figure of modern history.'

Albany     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     This family will  VAN RENSSELAER ever stand in his-  tory as the original  owner of a very important and large area of  land in the New World. Everyone in the  United States either bearing that name or of  the blood, must turn to Albany in order to  trace his or her descent, which leads to the  single progenitor of the family in America.  For nearly three centuries it has been a fam-  ily whose members have invariably maintained,  by culture and mode of living, an undisputed  prominence, yet with a well-known reluctance  to force itself into public affairs, preferring  that retirement which refinement usually seeks,  avoiding notoriety and the contiict concomi-  tant with affairs of business life and public  ofifice.   The family, however, has never siU^ered the  complaint of any lack of patriotism nor of  failing to respond to a genuine appeal to serve  the government in an official capacity. It can  with full right count its numbers who have  done both with a verdict of fullest credit from  the people. The direct line has had its rep-  resentation in the congress of the nation, in  the state senate and assembly of New York,  and in the chair of the lieutenant-governor of  the Empire State.   (I) Kiliaen Van Rensselaer, son of Hen-  •drick Van Rensselaer and Maria Pafraet, was  born in Hasselt, Province of Overyssel, in the  Netherlands, about 1580, and died in Amster-  dam, Holland, in 1644. He was the first Pa-  troon, and the founder of the colony of Rens-  selaerswyck in America ; was a wealthy mer-  chant of Amsterdam, known to be a dealer in  pearls and precious stones, to have had some  reputation as a banker and general merchant,  and owned large estates in Holland. He ex-  hibited sagacity in his stand taken with regard  to the policy of the colony, as against the de-  sires of his associates who desired to grow  wealthy with rapidity. They sought to have  those sent out engage in hunting for the pur-  pose of immediate and large shipments to for-  eign lands, while he desired that the colonists     become settlers, owning their houses, leading  happy and contented lives, so that they would  be willing to remain there, raise large families,  and continue to work on an ever increasing  scale as they prospered. He not only had the  courage to found a colony in the wilds of an  luiknown America ; but possessed the energy  to i)ush the work, once begun, and discourag-  ing at times, until it prospered.   In January, 1631, he sent Marinus Adri-  aensz, from \'eere, with some assistants, as  tobacco planters, and in July he sent Laurens  Laurensz, from Kopehaven, with another  Northman, to operate the saw and gristmill,  also a number of laborers and some ten calves.  Knowing that they could not succeed in their  support for the first two or three years, he  allowed them from 150 to 180 guilders per  annum. He also provided the colonists with  implements, and allowed the farm hands from  forty to ninety guilders a year. Between 1630  and 1632 he transported on these terms ten  persons in the first year, and twelve in the  next two succeeding years.   On March 6, 1642, Patroon Kiliaen Van  Rensselaer requested the classis of Amsterdam  to send 'a good, honest and pure preacher' to  his colony, and that body selected Dominie  Johannes Megapolensis Jr., pastor of Schorel  and berg of the Alkmaar classis, who ac-  cepted the call of six years, conditioned on a  salary of one thousand guilders ($400) that  he need not be required to work as a farmer,  the same to be paid in meat, drink and what-  c\er he might claim.   Authentic records show that Kiliaen Van  Rensselaer, first Patroon, died in 1644, in  Amsterdam, Holland, although it has been  published that his death took place in 1645  and also 1646. He was twice married. His  first wife was Hillegonda Van Bylaer (or  Bijler), daughter of Jan Van Bylaer, member  of a prominent family in Holland. By her  he had three children. She died in Holland,  and was buried January i, 1627, in the Oude  Kerk. His second wife was Anna Van Wely  (or Weely), whom he married December 14,     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     1627, and by her he had seven children. She  was the daughter of Jan Van Wely the young-  er, of Barneveldt, residing at The Hague, and  of Leonora Haukens (or HaeckensJ, of Ant-  werp. To Anna \'an Wely was presented in  1684 the first thimble, made by a goldsmith  named Nicholas Van Benschoten, as a protec-  tion for her dainty fingers. She died June 12,  1670. The first and second wives were ap-  parently cousins.   The children of Kiliaen Van Rensselaer  were: i. Hendrick, died in childhood. 2.  Johannes, baptized September 4, 1625, died in  the latter part of 1662, or early in 1663. He  was the second Patroon, but never came to  America. Being a minor, of about nineteen  years, when his father died in 1644, tlie es-  tates in Holland and at Rensselaerswyck were  placed in charge of executors. They selected  Brant Arentse Van Slichtenhorst to take  charge of the colony, in place of Arent Van  Curler, resigned, who arrived at Fort Orange,  March 22, 1648. 3. Maria, died without issue.  4. Hillegonda, buried August 23, 1664; with-  out issue. 5. Eleanora, died without issue. 6.  Susanna, lived and died in Holland; married  Jan de la Court, August 5, 1664. 7. Jan Bap-  tist, born in Holland; was the first of the name  to visit America, coming as 'Director' of  Rensselaerswyck colony in 165 1, returned to  Holland in 1658. 8. Jeremias, born in Amster-  dam, Holland, 1632, became the third Pa-  troon; (see forward). 9. Rev. Nicolaas  (Nicholas), born in Holland, died there about  1695. He came to America, arriving at Rens-  selaerswyck, June 30. 1664, and in that year  built for himself a residence on the west bank  of the Hudson river, about four miles north  of Albany, called The Flatts, which was long  afterwards known as Schuyler's Bouwerie.  and to this day is known as the Schuyler  Flatts, because he sold it, June 22, 1672, to  Philip Pieterse Schuyler, the father of Al-  bany's first mayor, Pieter Schuyler.   (H) Colonel Jeremias Van Rensselaer, son  of Kiliaen Van Rensselaer and .'Vnna Van  Wely, was born in Amsterdam. Holland, in  1632, and was the third Patroon. He died in  Rensselaerswyck, October 12, 1674. Because  he was the first patroon who resided in the  colony, he was considered the first lord of the  manor nf Rensselaerswyck. It has constituted  considerable confusion to distinguish in the  series the proper numerical position of the     patroon and the lord of the manor, many his-  torians employing the terms as though synony-  mous expressions, in error. It fell to the lot  of Jeremias \'an Rensselaer to witness the  overthrow of the Dutch rule at Fort Orange,  September 24, 1664. and to find it again to  revert to the Dutch government, August 5,  1673, when the fort at Albany became known  as Willemstadt.   He continued the work of his father on  much the same lines. His eftorls saw the com-  pletion of the Dutch church edifice, a rude,  wooden affair, in July, 1646. One may form  an excellent idea of the colony's aspects by  what Father Isaac Jogues, the Jesuit mission-  ary residing there, wrote thereof on August  3, 1646:   'There arc two things in this settlement — first, a  miserable little fort called Fort Orange, built of logs.  with four or live pieces of Breteuil cannon and as  many swivels. This has been reserved and is main-  tained by the West India Company. This fort was  formerly on an island in the river. It is now on the  mainland toward the Iroquois, a little above the said  island. Second, a colony sent here by this Rens-  selaer, who is the patroon. This colony is composed  of about a hundred persons, who reside in some  twenty-five or thirty houses, built along the river as  each one found most convenient. In the principal  house lives the patroon's agent: the minister has his  apart, in which service is performed. There is also  a kind of bailiff here, whom they call the seneschal,  who administers justice. Their houses are solely of  boards and thatched, with no mason-work except  the chimneys. The forest furnishes many fine pines ;  they make boards by means of their mills, which  they have here for the purpose. They found some  pieces of cultivated ground, which the savages had  formerly cleared, and in which they sow wheat and  oats for beer, and for their horses, of which they  have great numbers. There is little land fit for  tillage, being hemmed in by hills, w-hich are poor  soil. This obliges them to separate, and they al-  ready occupy two or three leagues of the country.  Trade is free to all ; this gives the Indians all things  cheap, each of the Hollanders outbidding his neigh-  bor, and being satisfied, provided he can gain some  little profit.'   Colonel Jeremias Van Rensselaer, the third  Patroon. married, at New Amsterdam, July  12. 1662, Maria \'an Cortlandt. She was borii  July 20. 1645, died January 24. 1689, daughter  of Oloff Stevensen \'an Cortlandt, who came  to New .\msterdam in 1637 from W'yck by  Duurstede, Province of Utrecht, Holland, and  died in New York City.

Hendrick, born at Rens-  selaerswyck, October 23, 1667; resided in  Greenbush, Rensselaer county (Rensselaer, N.  Y.), where he died July 2, 1740. 5. Maria,  born at Rensselaerswyck, October 25, 1672 ;  married, at that place, September 14, 1691,  Peter Schuyler, son of Philip Pieterse Schuy-  ler and Margareta Van Slechtenhorst.   (Ill) Kiliaen (2), son of Colonel Jeremias  Van Rensselaer and Maria Van Cortlandt, be-  ing the fourth Patroon of Rensselaerswyck,  was born there August 24, 1663, being 'Fri-  day morning towards eight o'clock,' and 'was  baptized the next Sunday.' He died at Rens-  selaerswyck in 1719. He was left in the man-  agement of the manor for account of the heirs  of the first patroon until 1695. At this date,  all the children of Kiliaen Van Rensselaer, the  projector of the colony, were dead, except two,  Eleanora and Richard, and the latter was the  treasurer of Vianen, a legalized asylum in  Holland for criminals. The \'an Rensselaer  estate was not yet divided among his heirs, but  for nearly fifty years had been held in com-  mon. Besides the manor there was a large  estate in Holland (the Crailo) and other prop-  erty. The time had now arrived for the heirs  to make a settlement. Controversies had  arisen among them, and, to end the disputes.  Kiliaen Van Rensselaer (son of Jan Baptist  Van Rensselaer) was delegated by the heirs  in Holland to visit America and if possible  make a complete settlement with the children  of Jeremias, the third Patroon, as the only  heirs in this country. Kiliaen, eldest son of  Jeremias, and the fourth Patroon, was ap-  pointed with power of attorney to act for the  family of which he w-as a member. The  'cousins met, and after a prolonged discussion  in which, as is usual, both lost their temper,  they at last came to an amicable agreement to  their mutual satisfaction. The indenture is  dated New York, November i, 1695. The  heirs in Holland released to the heirs in Al-  bany all right and title in the manor, which  was reciprocated by the release of the latter  to the former of all right and title to the land  in Holland, known as the Crailo, and another     tract in Guelderland. They also agreed to  deliver the titles to three farms in the manor,  reserving the tenths, and to pay in addition  seven hundred pieces of eight. They also re-  leased all claims on personal property in Hol-  land, as well as on certain expectations from  relatives on their decease. Bonds were ex-  changed between the cousins for the faithful  performance of the contract, and the work was  complete. At last, in 1695, the vast estate of  the old Patroon was settled, and the colony he  founded in 1630, with its territory of practi-  cally twenty-four by forty-eight miles, was in  possession of one family, consisting of Kiliaen,  Johannes, Hendrick, Maria (wife of Mayor  Pieter Schuyler), and Anna (wife of William  Nicoll). Besides the manor they owned an-  other tract of land containing 62,000 acres,  known as the CJaverack patent, and quite com-  monly called the 'Lower Manor.' The latter  was on the eastern side of the river, in the  vicinity of what is now Hudson, New York.  At this time the province was under the Eng-  lish law, and the eldest son was heir-at-law  of the real estate belonging to his father. To  Kiliaen, the eldest son of Jeremias Van Rens-  selaer, deceased, a patent was granted May  20, 1704, for the entire manor, including the  Claverack jiatent. His brother Johannes hav-  ing died without issue, there were only three  others interested. Kiliaen conveyed to his  brother Hendrick, on June i, 1704, the Clav-  erack patent and some 1,500 acres on the east  side of the river, opposite Albany, later known  as Greenbush, and then as Rensselaer, New  York. To his sister Maria or her heirs he  gave a farm of a few hundred acres adjoin-  ing The Flatts, above Albany, and to his sister  .Anna or her heirs he gave a farm larger in  extent, but at that time no more valuable, lo-  cated on the west bank of the river, in the  tow-n of Bethlehem.   Kiliaen Van Rensselaer devoted much of his  life to the public service. He was an officer  of the militia and one of the magistrates, and  represented the manor in the assembly from  1693 to 1704, in which latter year he was ap-  pointed to the council, remaining a member  until he died in 1719. The settling of the  manor was much retarded by Indian wars.  It was a common practice for the tribes to  resell the lands to others after they had sold  to Van Rensselaer in 1630. Kiliaen's grand-  father's old miller, Barent Pieterse Coeymans,     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     who came out in 1636, purchased from the  Catskill Indians, in 1673, a tract of land eight  miles along the river by twelve miles deep,  which was actually the manor lands. He even  procured a patent for it from Governor Love-  lace, April. 1673, and the legal contest over  it was not decided until 1706. Of his children,  two of the three sons, Jcremias and Stephen,  survived him, and these were successively  patroons. Two of his daughters, Anna and  Gertrude, married brothers, sons of Arent  Schuyler, of Belleville, New Jersey.   It was while Kiliaen Van Rensselaer, fourth  Patroon, was alive and at the head of the  colony, that Albany became a city by charter  granted by Governor Thomas Dongan, July  22, 1686. Naturally it created a serious state  of affairs, for it meant the determination of  the prescribed areas of Rensselaerswyck and  Albany, which had been geographically very  closely connected, for the legal security of  which Van Rensselaer had secured purchaser's  rights from the Indians. Dongan came to  Albany in May, 1686, and was requested by  the most prominent men to issue a charter by  which the village might acquire larger bound-  aries and by virtue of being a city would have  a higher guarantee of property titles than that  of magistrates. This forced Dongan to obtain  a relinquishment of the Van Rensselaer claim'^  to the land the people would include within  the bounds, and his decision, as reported Feb-  ruary 22. 1687. to the privy council of King  James, regarding the rights of each party, is  as follows :   'The Town of .-Mbany lyes within the Ranslaers  Colony. And to sav the truth the RanMaers had the  right to it, for it was they settled the place, and upon  a petition of one of them to our present King (James  II.) about .Mbany the Petitioner was referred to his  Matvs Council at Law, who upon perusal of the  Ranslaers Papers, made their return that it was their  opinion that it did belonR to them. Upon which  there was an order sent over to Sir Edmund Andros  that the Ranslaers should be put in possession of  Albany. & that every house should pay some two  Beavers, some more, some less, according to their  dimensions. Pr annum, for thirty years and after-  wards the Ranslaers to nut what rent upon them  they co\dd agree for. What reason Sir Edmund  Andros has given for not nutting these orders into  execution I know not. The Ranslaers came and  brought mec the same orders which I thought not  convenient to execute, judgeing it not for his Matys  Interest that the second Town of the Government &  which brink's his Maty soe great a Revenue, should  bee in the hands of any particular men. The town  of itself is upon a barren sandy spot of Land, &     the Inhabitants live wholly upon Trade with the In-  dians. By the means of .Mr. James Graham, Judge  (John) Palmer & Mr. (Stephanus van) Cortlandt  that have great influence on the people, I got the  Ranslaers to release their pretence to the Town and  sixteen miles into the Country for Commons to the  King, with liberty to cut firewood within the Colony  for one & twenty years. After I had obtained this  release of the Ranslaers I passed the patent for Al-  bany, wherein was included the aforementioned Pas-  ture to which the People apprehended they had so  good a right that they expressed themselves discon-  tented at my reserving a small spot of it for a garden  for the use of the Garrison. That the people of .-M-  bany has given mee seven hundred pounds is untrue.  I am but promised three hundred pounds which is  not near my Prquisits, viz. ten shillings for every  house & the like for every hundred acres patented  by mee.'   Kiliaen \'an Rensselaer, the fourth Patroon,  married Alaria Van Cortlandt, in New York  City, (Jctober 15, 1701. She was born on her  father's extensive estate, the Van Cortlandt  Manor, near Croton, New York, April 4, 1680.  She wrote her name Maritje.

(IV) Stephen, son of Kiliaen Van Reus-     SCJUTHERX NEW YORK     selaer and Maria Van Cortlandt, was born at  Albany, New York, March 17, 1707; was bap-  tized March 23 by Dominie Lydius, of the  Dutch Reformed Church, with General PhiHp  Schuyler, godfather, Maria Van Cortlandt and  Elizabeth Johanna Schuyler, godmothers; died  at the Manor House in Albany, and was  buried 'at the mills' on July i, 1747. He was  the sixth Patroon, and known as the fourth  Lord of the Manor. His elder brother, Jere-  mias Van Rensselaer, had been the fifth Pa-  troon, but died unmarried in 1745, as the old-  est son of Kiliaen Van Rensselaer. Stephen  therefore succeeded him in control. His con-  stitution was not robust, and he never took a  very active part in public affairs, and only two  years after his succession died at the age of  forty. The population of the province of New  York at that time was 61,589. Colonel Will-  iam Johnson was at that period sending bands  of Indian allies into Canada, for in Septem-  ber, 1746, he had been appointed 'chief man-  ager of the Indian war and colonel over all  the Indians by their own approbation.' The  savages had burned the farms at Saratoga  (Schuylerville) November 17, 1745, and the  French were expected to move upon Albany  at any time. He married, at Albany, July 5,  1729, Elizabeth Groesbeck, born at Albany,  baptized August 17, 1707, buried December  31, 1756. Her father was Stephanus Groes-  beck, a trader (son of Claas Jacobse Groes-  beck, from Rotterdam in 1662), buried July  17, 1744, who married, July 16, 1699, Eliza-  beth Lansing (born 1679), daughter of Johan-  nes Lansing (born in Hassel and buried at  Albany, February 28. 1728) and Gertrude Van  Schaick.

(V) Stephen (2), son of Stephen Van  Rensselaer and Elizabeth Groesbeck, was born  at Rensselaerswyck, baptized June 2, 1742, and  died at Watervliet, Albany county, October 19,  1769. He was the seventh Patroon. His fa-  ther had died when he was only five years old  and the estate had to be managed for him. At  about that time (in 1749) the population of  Albany county was 10,634, and of the colony  of New York 73,348. The boundary between  New York and Massachusetts was in dispute  in 1752, as the manors of Hendrick Van Rens-  selaer and Robert Livingston, on the east side  of the Hudson, were being encroached upon.  In 1753 the Albany council petitioned Gov-  ernor Clinton to levy a tax on the province  in order to raise $30,000 to erect a stone wall  about -the city, claiming it required such de-  fense as a frontier town. The various prov-  inces sent commissioners to the colonial con-  gress held in Albany, June, 1754, and 1755  marked the great conflict with the French, with  serious engagements along Lakes Champlain  and George, which were of vital concern to  Albany. On September 17, 1755, General  Philip Schuyler married Catharine Van Rens-  selaer, only daughter of Colonel John Van  Rensselaer, of the Claverack Manor, and  granddaughter of the original owner of the  vast tract on the east side after the first divi-  sion of the Van Rensselaer patent. In 1756  the population of Albany county had risen to  17,524, and the Schuyler Flatts were burned  that year. So serious was the Massachusetts  boundary dispute in July, 1757, that ofifers  were made to take Hendrick Van Rensselaer  dead or alive. Troops assembled here in great  numbers under General James Abercrombie in  1758, and following the death of Lord Howe  at Ticonderoga, July 6th, his body was brought  here for burial in St. Peter's Church.   The A'an Rensselaer Manor House, ■ • he  'Patroon's,' as it was more commonly cal'cd,  was built by Stephen Van Rensselaer in 1765.  At the time of its erection it was unquestion-  ably the handsomest house in the colonies, and  as such exerted a wide influence over the archi-  tecture of the more ambitious dwellings. Onq  or two (possibly three) other edifices had been  used by the head of the family before this, and  likewise styled the Manor House ; but they     SOUTH KRN NEW YORK     were ])oor affairs compared with this one or  with the average residence of these days in a  country village. The original house was built  of brick of unusual size (9 x 4'^ x 2 inches)  and it was painted in the colonial colors, cream  and white. A short Hight of steps led up to  the Dutch 'stoop,' a small porch whose roof  was upheld by two Doric columns, above  which, in the second story, was the great Pal-  ladian window. The house was flanked at  cither end with octagonal wings one story in  height. Tlie walls were of unusual solidity,  and the entire construction was the heaviest.  The floor beams were of hewn pine, ranging  from 3 X 12 to 9 X 11 inches. All about it  were gardens and lawns, surrounded by enor-  mous elms, and the gradual slope towards the  Hudson river was beautified for acres with  floral effects, fountain and statuary. Located  one mile north of State street, it stood directly  at the head of Broadway, which made a turn  to the west in order to continue northward as  the Troy road. Patroon's creek was the south-  ern demarcation of the property, spanned by a  massive brownstone bridge, and at its edge  stood the lodge where the keeper lived. It was  to this handsome home that Stephen Van Rens-  selaer brought his bride, Catherine Livingston ;  but he enjoyed it only a brief spell, for within  six years of his marriage he died.   Stejjhen \'an Rensselaer, the seventh Pa-  troon, married, in New York City, januarj'  2^, 1764. Catherine Livingston, born August  25, I74> died .April 17, 1810. Her father was  Philip Livingston, signer of the Declaration of  Indc]icndence for Mew York state, born Janu-  ary 15, 1716, died at York, Pennsylvania. June  12, 1778, who married, April 14, 1740. Chris-  tina Ten Broeck, born December 30. 1718. died  June 29, 1801. When a widow, following the  death of her husband, October 19, 1769, Mrs.  Van Rensselaer married, at .Mbany, July 19.  1775, Dominie Eilardus Westerlo, pastor of  the Dutch Reformed Church in Albany, who  was born in Groeningen, came to Albany in  1760, and died in Albany, December 26, 1790,  by whom she had Rensselaer Westerlo, born  in the Manor House, May 6, 1776, died April  18, 185 1, married May 5, 1S05, Jane Lansing,  daughter of Chancellor John Lansing; and a  daughter, Catherine, born in the Manor House,  August 23, T778. died at .Albany, September  27, 1846. married Judge John Woodworth.  Children of seventh Patroon Stephen Van     Rensselaer and Catherine Livingston: 1.  Stephen, born in New York City, November  I, 1764. (See forward.) 2. Philip Schuy-  ler, born at the Manor House, Albany,  April 15, 1766; died at No. 85 State street,  Albany, September 25, 1824; was thirty-  second mayor of Albany, officiating the  longest of any mayor, January i, 1799, to July  7, 1816, and July 3, 1819, to February 18, 1821,  and was president of the Bank of Albany ;  married, 1787, Anna de Peyster Van Cort-  landt, born 1766, died January 10, 1855, and  was daughter of General Philip Van Cort-  landt and Catherine De Peyster ; no issue. 3.  Elizabeth, born at the Manor House in Al-  bany, August 15, 1768; died in Albany, March  27, 1841 ; married in Albany. September 18,  1787. John Bradstreet Schuyler, born in Al-  bany, and was baptized July 23, 1765, died at  Sarat<5ga (Schuylerville). August 19, 1795,  son of (leneral I'hilip Schuyler and Catherine  \'an Rensselaer, by whom she had two sons —  Philip, born in Albany, October 26, 1788, mar-  ried (Irace Hunter; and Stephen Van Rens-  selaer, born May 4, 1790, died young. After  the death of John B. Schuyler, Elizabeth, his  widow, married John Bleecker, in 1800. by  whom she had one daughter, who married  Cornelius Glen Van Rensselaer, and several  sons who died unmarried, among them Ste-  phen \'an Rensselaer Bleecker, born January  5, 1803: died April 16, 1827.   (\T) General Stephen Van Rensselaer, the  eighth Patroon, son of Stephen (2) \'an Rens-  selaer and Catherine Livingston, was born in  the house of his grandfather, Philip Living-  ston, the Signer, in New York City, Novem-  ber I, 1764, and died in the Manor House at  Alljany, New York, January 26, 1839. The  new manor house of the Patroon was not  completed until he was one year old, in 1765,  and his father brought him and his mother  there so soon as it was ready. His father  died October 19, 1769, at the age of twenty-  seven, when the son was less than six years  old, so the care of the great landed and feudal  estate, which had fallen exclusively to him by  the rule of primogeniture, was committed to  his uncle. General .Miraham Ten Broeck. It  was managed by him with rare ability through-  out the minority of his ward, despite the dis-  turbed condition of affairs during the revolu-  tionary period, when Albany was the scene of  serious preparation for war in collecting men     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     and supplies for the great conflict at Bemis  Heights and old Saratoga or Schuylerville.  General Ten Broeck was a participant in this  military movement to the north, and was the  twenty-eighth mayor of Albany, officiating  from April 9, 1/79, to Jime 26, 1783, and a  second term from October 15, 1796, to De-  cember 31, 179S. He had married Elizabeth,  daughter of Patroon Stephen \'an Rensselaer  and Elizabeth Groesbeck, November i, 1763.  Under his direction the manor house was  erected. Stephen was given his earliest edu-  cation at Albany by John Waters, who was  what was then known as a professional school-  master, and, being before the days of printed  spelling-books, he was taught from a horn-  book. A little later his grandfather, Philip  Livingston, took charge of his education, plac-  ing him at a school in Elizabethtown, New  Jersey; but the troublous times of the revolu-  tion drove Livingston with his family from  his home in New York City, and they took  refuge in Kingston. Fortunately he estab-  lished a classical academy there under John  Addison, a fine Scotchman possessing thor-  ough scholarship and who was later a state  senator. It then became necessary to supply  the young man with an advanced education,  and he was sent to Princeton, when the cele-  brated Dr. Witherspoon, scholar, divine and  patriot, was president. Witherspoon aban-  doned education for the pursuit of war, was  a Signer of the Declaration, and young Van  Rensselaer, to avoid the seat of war, was sent  to Cambridge, where he became a Harvard  graduate in 1782. In i82'5 Yale conferred  upon him the degree of Doctor of Laws. The  year following his graduation in 1782, peace  had been restored in the United States, and  the new nation firmly established. There was  no occasion for the young man, when nine-  teen years of age, to fight. Instead, he turned  his attention to matrimony, and married Mar-  garet Schuyler, at 'Old' Saratoga (Schuyler-  ville). New York, in 1783. She was third  daughter of General Philip Schuyler and  Catherine Van Rensselaer. Her next elder  sister, Elizabeth, had married Alexander  Hamilton, who were thus the uncle and aunt  of General Stephen Van Rensselaer. Mar-  garet Schuyler was born in Albany, and bap-  tized there September 24, 1758, and she died  there on March 14, 1801. Her remains re-  pose in the center of the Van Rensselaer lot     in the Albany Rural Cemetery. Her father  was General Philip Schuyler, commander of  the Army of the North in 1777, and trusted  friend of Washington, who was born in Al-  bany, November 11, 1733, married Septem-  ber 17, 1755, and died in Albany, November  18, 1804. Her mother was Catherine \'an  Rensselaer, born in 'The ,Crailo,' Greenbush  (Rensselaer, New York), November 4, 1734,  died in the Schuyler Mansion, Albany, March  7, 1803, and was daughter of Johannes Van  Rensselaer and Engeltie (Angelica) Living-  ston, the latter being the daughter of Robert  Livingston, Jun., twelfth mayor of Albany.  John \'an Rensselaer became heir of the  Claverack patent, when his father, Hendrick,  died July 2, 1740, and was thus the owner of  'The Crailo' in Greenbush, called Rensselaer  later. It will be remembered that Hendrick  Van Rensselaer was a brother of the last  Patroon by the name of Kiliaen, in other  words, the younger brother of Stephen's great-  grandfather. Hendrick was born in 1667,  died in 1689, and had married Catharina Van  Brough (or Verbrugge), whose share in the  property left by their father Jeremias was the  Claverack property. At this time Stephen Van  Rensselaer's mother was the wife of Dominie  Eilardus Westerlo, whom she had married in  Albany, July 19, 1775, and they were residing  in the Manor House, which she had a right  to do as the Patroon's widow. He was an  original Dutchman, born in Groeningen,  known widely as a fine scholar, an eminent  divine, and as the pastor for a long period of  the Dutch Reformed Church in Albany,  preaching in the Dutch language for the first  fifteen or twenty years of his charge. As  Dominie Westerlo and his wife, the mother  of Stephen, were occupying the Manor House,  consequently the young man brought his bride  to the mansion at the southeast corner of  North Market street (Broadway) and North  Ferry street, which had served as an ample  parsonage. When, however. Stephen reached  his majority. Dr. Westerlo and his wife ex-  changed residences with the young Patroon  and his bride, the latter couple leaving the  parsonage to occupy the manor house. The  day of his attaining his majority was made  one of great celebration, and from miles  around the tenantry and the social set of the  city flocked to participate in his hospitality.  Mr. Van Rensselaer found it necessary to     8     SOUTHERN XRW YORK     look critically after the interests of his manor,  for in order to secure good returns it was  essential that the lands should be cultivated,  and while speculators would buy lands, the  farmers, or laborious tillers of the soil, were  unwilling to contract for the fee. By offering  leases in fee or for long terms at a moderate  lental, he readily succeeded in bringing a large  proportion of his lahds, comprising the greater  portion of the counties of Albany and Rens-  selaer, into cultivation, thus acquiring a good-  ly income, yet those who knew him have said  'he had none of that morbid appetite for  wealth which grows ravenous by what it feeds  on.' He received his first military commis-  sion, as a major of infantry, in 1786, when  twenty-two years old, and two years later was  promoted to colonel and given command of a  regiment. In 1801 Governor John Jay direct-  ed the cavalry of New York to be divided  from the infantry, and the cavalry formed a  single division, with two brigades, and the  command of the whole was conferred upon  Stephen \'an Rensselaer. He bore the com-  mission of major-general of cavalry to his  death. In 178' he took an important step in  his career as a man of character, when twen-  ty-three years of age and on the threshold of  a life which might have been one pampered  with wanton and luxurious excesses, he de-  liberately chose, by a formal profession of  religious faith and a personal vow of religious  obedience, according to the doctrines and dis-  cipline of the Christian church as adopted by  the Dutch reformers, to pledge himself to a  life of temperance, simplicity, truth and pur-  ity. How well he kept his vow is known to  all who were intimately acquainted with the  manner of his life, for his domestic relations  were the most tender, and his character be-  fore the world harmonious and beautiful, as  well as replete with deeds of public service.  Towards the close of 1787 the convention sit-  ting in Philadelphia to frame a constitution,  terminated its labors and submitted its work  for the ju<lgnient of the people. Mr. Van  Rensselaer took ground promptly, and was  pronouncedly in favor of the constitution.  The next spring delegates to the state con-  vention were to be chosen from Albany coun-  ty, and both Yates and Lansing, who had left  the riiiladclpliia convention before its labors  were completed, were residents of the same  county and held great power as anti-Federal-     ists. It was to be expected that their views  would prevail, yet Mr. Van Rensselaer, urged  by his party to uphold their moral force in  the controversy, consented to stand as a can-  didate for the assembly, and despite his popu-  larity was beaten. In the spring of the next  year. 1789, however, Mr. Van Rensselaer was  again a candidate, and, with the previous ques-  tion settled, was elected by an enormous ma-  jority. In the spring of 1790 he was elected  to the state senate and was re-elected, serving  continuously until 1795, as a faithful, vigilant  and influential member. On standing com-  mittees, of which there were few then, he was  always an important member. At the next  gubernatorial election, 1795, he was chosen  lieutenant-governor, with Hon. John Jay as  executive, Messrs. Yates and Floyd heading  the opposition ticket. In 1798 both were re-  nominated and elected by handsome majori-  ties. This time Chancellor Livingston was  Mr. Jay's opponent, while Mr. Van Rens-  selaer was the candidate of both Federalists  and the antis, so universally popular had he  become. At the same time, the plan was to  attract votes for Livingston away from Jay.  In January, 1801, a convention was held at  the Tontine Coffee House in Albany, and Mr.  Van Rensselaer was unanimously named the  candidate for governor. His nomination was  enthusiastically seconded in New York City  and at public meetings all over the state. His  purity, reliable judgment and competent ac-  quaintance with interests and business of the  state commended hiin; but the parties were  at such great odds, the rancor so fearful, that  it poisoned even whole families with hatred  one for another. De Witt Clinton was named  as his opponent. He was also deservedly  popular and a man of great energy in affairs  of moment. In the midst of the state cam-  paign aimouncement of the election of Thom-  as Jefferson was announced. It helped in  large measure to turn the tide, and Mr. Van  Rensselaer was defeated by a majority of less  than 4,000 votes. In October, 1801, a state  convention met at Albany to revise the con-  stitution, and Mr. Van Rensselaer was a mem-  ber, presiding during much of the delibera-  tions as chairmS'>, although Aaron Burr was  its president. Ih 1807 he was elected to the  assembly, with his friend, .'\braham Van  A'echten. as colleague. In March. 1810. a  commission was chosen l)v the legislature, con-     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     State of New York, and was subsequently the  chancellor until his death. In December, 1823,  General Van Rensselaer took his seat in con-  gress for the first time, and was continued in  his place by re-election for three successive  terms, retiring March 4, 1829. He held the  position of chairman of the committee on agri-  culture. His report on tariff laws affecting  agriculture, made in March, 1824, was a valu-  able one. His ballot on the presidency, in  February, 1S25, determined the vote of his  state's delegation in favor of Mr. Adams. On  May 5, 1824, the Albany Institute was organ-  ized for the purpose of engaging in fields of  observation of the natural sciences, for study  of new theories and discoveries, and the prepa-  ration of learned papers. General Van Rens-  selaer was elected its first president, having  the local prestige of being the president of the  Albany Lyceum of Natural History. This so-  ciety elected him annually through fifteen  years, until his death. He perceived the ad-  vantage of placing knowledge before the peo-  ple, and his first movement was to employ  Professor Eaton, with several competent as-  sistants, to traverse the state near the route  of the Erie canal, taking apparatus and speci-  mens to aid the delivery of lectures before  business men and farmers in all the villages  along the line. These were given on chemis-  try, natural philosophy and various branches  of natural history, and were given in the sum-  mer of 1824 at his expense. The experiment  was a success. He had also been accustomed  to send his schoolmaster among his tenants  in the same capacity, and this led him, on  November 5, 1824, to provide a suitable build-  ing in Troy. New York, for the conduct of a  school under Rev. Dr. Blatchford, to whom  he delivered a set of rules for its government.  He endowed it with professors, and it was in-  corporated in 1826 as the Rensselaer Institute.  Through the next two years he paid one-half  of its current expenses, and at his death he  endowed it. Not alone did he institute the  Rensselaer Polytechnic, but to two colleges he  gave $5,000 each, and to a single agent for the  prosecution of scientific research and advance-  ment of education no less than $30,000. His  benefactions were not only most liberal, but  wisely devoted, and in those days these sums  were considered fortunes in themselves. He  was connected with the institution of Masonry,  having been initiated in 1786, when twenty-     two years old, and was placed in official sta-  tion, becoming successively junior and senior  warden, and then master. In 1793 he declined  further election in Master's Lodge, but in  1825 was installed in the highest office of  Masonry, that of grand master, which act was  conducted by Governor DeW'itt Clinton. The  funeral of General Van Rensselaer was a most  impressive one, perhaps more so than any  other at Albany before or afterwards. The  religious service was held at the North Dutch  Church, and the body, in a simple, unadorned  casket, was borne nearly a mile to the family  vault, upon men's shoulders, the bearers fre-  quently relieving each other, for no hearse was  permitted to receive the hallowed burthen.  The mourners, composed of the family, civic  officials. Masonic bodies, school societies, the  chief magistrate and other executive officers of  the state, members of the legislature, were all  on foot, not a carriage being in use. The mili-  tary were in citizens' dress ; all badges of of-  fice were laid aside ; no plumes nodded ; no  helmets glistened ; no music murmured ; sol-  emn, slow and silent, the vast throng moved  through the highway to the north. It is of  interest to note the manner in which in those  days the intelligence of his death was sent to  New York City, where he was well known,  and it being necessary to transmit the news  because of his prominence in the state's public  life. It is recorded in Munsell's 'Notes from  the Newspapers,' as an item of news on that  day. January 26, 1839:   '.\n express was started by Messrs. Baker &  Walker, to carry the intelligence of the Patroon's  death to New York. A Mr. Dimmick left .\lbany 14  miniues before 6 p. m. in a sulkey. .^t Redhook, he  found a bridge gone, but mounted his horse and  swam the stream, drawing the sulkey after him. M  Fishkill, the obstruction was much more formidable.  The bridge was gone, and the road for more than  half a mile inundated. He again mounted his horse,  who pushed gallantly into the flood and swam, with  his rider and sulkey, over a quarter of a mile, bring-  ing both safely to the opposite shore. Notwithstand-  ing these and other obstructions the express arrived  at the Carlton House at 20 minutes past eight o'clock  in the morning, having rode over the distance of  about 150 miles in 14 H. -^i M.'   General Stephen Van Rensselaer, the eighth  Patroon, married (first) Margaret Schuyler,  daughter of General Philip Schuyler and  Catherine Van Rensselaer, at Schuylerville,  New York, June 6, 1783; and married (sec-  ond) Cornelia Paterson. at New Brunswick,  New Jersey, on May 17, 1802. She was born     SOUTllliKN NEW YORK     sjsting of seven persons — Gouverneur Morris,  DeW itt Clinton and Stephen Van Rensselaer  among the more important — for exploring a  route for a proposed western canal. In the  summer of that year, accompanied by a sur-  veyor, he traveled by horseback inspecting a  route for the projected undertaking which  resulted in the Erie canal, and they gave their  findings in February, 1811. With all his  enormous energy he advocated the measure  in the assembly, thus giving the plan an im-  petus very needful because of considerable  opposition. War against Great Britain was  declared in June, 18 12. This was another  crisis in his life. A requisition was made on  Grivcrnor Tompkins, of New York, and the  patriotic governor promptly obeyed, selecting  Major-General Stephen Van Rensselaer for  the command. They were then regarded as  rival candidates for the chief magistracy. The  lines of party W'ere distinctly drawn, and the  Federalists were charged with being hostile  to the war as being premature and unneces-  sary. General Van Rensselaer was a Feder-  alist. The appointment placed him in a po-  sition of embarrassment, for, should he de-  cline, it would tell against his party, and, on  the other hand, he was expected to defend  both the northern and western frontier, with  no experience in warfare, and dealing with  decidedly impracticable material in the make-  up of fighters. He did not hesitate an instant,  but accepted the service. His country had  summoned him to the field, and he was ready.  He was not a loiterer, for in an incredibly  short time he had thrown off the citizen sur-  rounded by political advisers, and had formed  his military family. In ten days he arrived at  Ogdensburgh, having inspected Sackett's Har-  bor on the way. On August 13th he was in  camp at Lewiston, just one month from his  call, and just two months later, on October  13th. he was engaged in one of the most gal-  lant and brilliant affairs of the whole war.  He carried his American arms into the ene-  my's territory and planted the flag of the  United States triumphantly on the Heights of  Quccnstown. Although gaining a complete  victory, unfortunately it was of brief duration,  on account of the defect' ' of his troops.  Had they remaincrl by him, ne could have re-  tained the peninsula of the upjjcr province of  Canada for the winter, for it was originally  planned that Fort George should also be     stormed by regular troops. Very valuable to  him had been the services of his aide, Colonel  Solomon Van Rensselaer, who was wounded  a number of times when in the thickest of the  tight. By the shameful refusal of his yeoman  soldiery, under ' the plea of constitutional  scruples, to march into the camp which had  been won for them, he should have felt wroth ;  but he reported it as an unvarnished relation  of facts, telling the truth plainly, but without  complaint or reproaches, for he had done his  full duty. The British had lost their General  iJrock by the engagement, and during the ces-  sation of hostilities agreed upon for six days,  both sides proceeded to humanitarian duties  of burying the dead and caring for the  wounded General \'an Rensselaer informed  his antagonist that he should order a salute to  be fired at his camp and also at Fort Niagara  on the occasion of the funeral solemnities of  tl:e brave and lamented Brock, to which the  stern General Sheaft'e replied: 'I feel too  strongly the generous tribute which you pro-  pose to pay for my departed friend and chief,  to be able to express the sense I entertain of  it.' General Van Rensselaer entered the gu-  bernatorial campaign against Daniel D. Tomp-  kins in the spring of 1813, but his party was  in the minority, even though giving him a  united support, and he was defeated in the  state by 3.600 votes out of the S3,ocx> cast in  the election. In 1816 he was again elected to  the assembly, and in March the canal commis-  sioners, with Mr. \'an Rensselaer at their  head and acting as chairman, presented their  report to the legislature, requesting that body  to adopt immediate measures for prosecuting  the enterprise. In April this great work was  authorized, the mana.gement committed to a  board of canal commissioners, with General  Van Rensselaer as a member. He was presi-  dent of that board for fifteen years, succeed-  ing DeWitt Clinton in April, 1824, and serv-  ing until his death in 1839.   In 1819 the legislature was induced to pass  an act for the encouragement and improve-  ment of agriculture, appropriating money to  be divided ratably among the counties, which  were to form county societies, with presidents,  who should form a central board.

(VIII) Captain Kiliaen (3) Van Renssa-  laer, third son of William P. and Sarah  (Rogers) Van Rensselaer, was born February  14. 1845. in Albany, and soon after his father  settled in New York, in which city the son was  educated. At the beginning of the civil war  he was but sixteen years of age, but before the  close of the conflict he entered the army and  became captain of Company I, in the Thirty-  ninth Regiment New York Volunteers, which  served under Generals Grant and Hancock,  and he participated in some fourteen different  enga.gements. After the close of the war he  traveled extensively abroad, and subsequently  engaged in the brokerage business in New  York. He died, November 26, 1905, in New  York City. Captain \'an Rensselaer was ac-  ti\e in many societies of religious and phil-     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     anthropic character, as well as others. He  was a director of the American Tract So-  ciety, of the City Missions, president of the  Grand Army Mission, and of the Sanitary  Aid Society. He took great interest in the  work and prosperity of the New York Pres-  byterian Church, in which he was an elder,  and gave much of his time to the cause of  similar organizations. He was a member of  the Holland, St. Nicholas, and Huguenot So-  cieties, of the Loyal Legion, and the Grand  Army of the Republic. Politically he was a  Republican.   He married, December 13, 1870, Olivia At-  terbury, of New York, a granddaughter of  Anson G. Phelps, the noted merchant and  philanthropist. She was a lineal descendant of  the celebrated Bishop Atterbury, of England,  and was a great-great-niece of Elias Boudinot.  first president of the congress of the United  States. Captain and Olivia (Atterbury) Van  Rensselaer were the parents of seven children :  Olive, married Lewis B. Gawtry, and resides  in New York ; Sarah Elizabeth, married Ben-  jamin W. Arnold, and li\es in Albany, New  York; Katherine Boudinot, died young; Edith,  died young; Kiliaen. mentioned below; Me-  lissa, died young; William Stephen.   (IX) Kiliaen (4), senior son of Kiliaen  (3) and Olivia (Atterbury) Van Rensselaer,  was born May 21, 1879, at Seabright, New  Jersey. He attended the Lawrenceville school,  and entered Princeton University, but did not  complete the course, going out as a soldier  in the Spanish war in 1898. He was a mem-  ber of the Twelfth New York Regiment,  which was stationed at Chickamauga, Georgia,  Lexington, Kentucky, Americus, Georgia, and  ^L'lntanzas, Cuba. After the close of this  service he settled in New York City, where  he became an investment broker, and now re-  sides in that city. He was a member of  Squadron A, National Guard State of New  York, from 1900 to 1905. He is a member  of the Union and Racket and Tennis Clubs  of New York, in religious faith a Presby-  terian, and politically a consistent Republi-  can.   He married, in New York, November 23,  1905, Dorothea Manson, daughter of Thomas  L. and May (Groot) Manson. They have a  daughter, Barbara, born April 13, 1908, in  New York.     (VH) General  VAN RENSSELAER Stephen (4) Van   Rensselaer, son of  General Stephen (3) Van Rensselaer, the  eighth Patroon, and Margaret Schuyler, was  born in the Manor House at Albany, New  York, March 29, 1789, and died in the same  place, May 25, 1868. He was given a thorough  education, and enjoyed the benefits of culture  acquired by travel abroad and by continual  association with people of retinement. In so-  cial and public life he was greatly respected,  and in his family much beloved. A leading  event in his life, as it affected him and his  family, was the anti-rent feud. Anti-rentism  had its origin in Albany county. Its exist-  ence dated from the death of General Van  Rens.selaer in 1839, the la.st holder of the  Manor of Rensselaerswyck under the British  crown and its regulations. He was known to  that generation as 'the Patroon,' was some-  t'nies styled the 'good Patroon,' and after  his death as 'the old Patroon.' Primogeni-  ture was the law of inheritance in England,  so it had been to some e.xtent in the British  colonies, and, as the eldest son, Stephen Van  Rensselaer had inherited the Manor. But the  revolution and subsequent laws changed the  rule of inheritance, giving alike to all the chil-  dren if no w'ill were made. In order to break  the force of this radical change, and so as to  continue this vast landed interests in the hands  of his two eldest sons, Stephen and William  Paterson Van Rensselaer, General Van Rens-  selaer (1764-1839), on reaching his majority,  had adopted the system of selling lands in  fee, reserving to himself in the conveyances,  and to his heirs and assigns, all mines and  minerals, all streams of water for mill pur-  poses, and beyond this, certain old-time feudal  returns, denominated rents, payable annually at  his Manor House, usually specified as so many  bushels of good, clean, merchantable winter  wheat, four fat fowl, and one day's service  with carriage and horses ; finally, the reserva-  tion or exaction of one-quarter of the pur-  chase price on every vendition of the land. In  other words, one condition alone provided  an income to him every time the purchaser  of land should resell it. It is said that the  mind of .Mcxander Hamilton conceived and  framed this form of lease or conveyance for  Van Rensselaer's especial benefit. Under such  peculiar conditions the land of the Patroon in     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     13     Albany and Rensselaer counties was sold to  innnmerable purchasers for farms. The sys-  tem operated successfully during the life of  the Patroon ; but when his son Stephen (born  in 1789), inherited the land by his father's  death in 1839, a new and serious trouble arose.  The first purchasers did not object, for they  had bought with the definite understanding  clearly before them ; but on the death of the  Patroon and also of the purchaser, the suc-  cessors of the latter, as new owners, began to  grow restive under the burdens imposed, and  when either Stephen or William P. Van  Rensselaer pressed for payments of the money  due as reserved in the deeds the owners of  the land began the question the legality of the  reservation. To Stephen Van Rensselaer and  his younger brother, William Paterson Van  Rensselaer, the Patroon, General Stephen Van  Rensselaer, had devised by his will, drawn on  April 18, 1837, all interest in the lands thus  sold by him in fee, with the reservations of  rents — in other words, they believed that they  owned or retained the soil. Stephen, the old-  est son, was to receive the rents in Albany  county, and William P. Van Rensselaer those  in Rensselaer county. The rents of this time  came in more sparingly and were paid more  I relunctantly than they had been to the father,  I who had been noted as one of the most gentle,  kind-hearted and benevolent of men, often  generously reducing the rents and in many  ; ways calling forth the love and gratitude of  I the land-holders. The only course open for  i his son was to sue in the courts, and it was  I not long before a strong hostility developed.  The legal contests of a quarter of a century  might have been avoided if the lawyers had  perceived that the deeds of the Patroon, being  ; absolute conveyances of all interest in the  lands, the reservations were, for that reason,  in\alid as incumbrances, made so by the Eng-  lish statute, known as the statute of quia  cinptores, which rendered it impossible for a  British subject, on a conveyance in fee of  his land, to make, or if made, to enforce by  re-entry or forfeiture, such feudal reserva-  tions. That was a right remaining in and be-  longing to the crown alone. It is probable  that Hamilton assumed that that statute was  never in force in the colonies, for it was  adopted back in the reign of Edward I., and  later lawyers might have dismissed the consid-     eration of it on the assumption it was not the  law of either colony or state.   In the spring of 1839 the anti-renters held  their preliminary meeting, numerously at-  tended by all the farmers living in the Helder-  berg towns. They appointed a committee to  wait on Mr. Van Rensselaer to ascertain  whether a compromise might not be efifected.  On May 22 the committee visited the office  of Mr. Van Rensselaer, but he refused to  recognize them and instructed his agent, Douw  B. Lansing, to inform them that he would  communicate in writing. He did so, inform-  ing them that he considered it would be an  injustice to himself and his family to consent  to their claims. From that time on his agents  had much difficulty in collecting rents, and  frequently, when attempting to do so, were  held off by shotguns. In December, Sheriff  Archer was obliged to call to his aid, in serv-  ing process, the posse coinitatis, or power of  the county. Politicians were alive to bring  the landholders into line, and urged the press  to take the matter up. After many years the  question was allowed to drop from politics and  the court of appeals rendered decisions in  special cases in 1852, 1859, and finally in 1863,  after which the matter rested.   The large area of the once famous 'Lum-  ber District' extending along the river front  from North Ferry street northward for a  mile, and real estate in or close to the city,  were not encumbered by perpetual leases,  and remained as a source of income for mem-  bers of the three generations following.  .\mong the papers preserved by the family is  the account-book of General Abraham Ten  Broeck, the guardian during the minority of  Stephen, and under the entry of a 'charge for  beef and liquor consumed in a dinner to the  tenantry on this your glorious twenty-first  birthday' is a brief mention of a transaction  which many years later took from the Van  Rensselaers many of their acres. On that day  the Patroon sold in fee, with warranty of  title, his farming lands in Albany and Rens-  selaer counties, and no less than nine hundred  farms of 150 acres each, or more than 207  square miles, were leased on that day.   ^^'hen Stephen (4) Van Rensselaer died.  May 25, 1868, he left behind him an enviable  reputation for the sterling virtues which had  distinguished the line from which he liad  descended. He was liberal in his benefactions     14     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     and dispensed wealth freely to all charitable  objects and church. On his death, about 2,500  acres between Troy and Shaker roads, north  of the Manor House, and in which he had a  life estate, reverted to his half-brother, Will-  iam Paterson Van Rensselaer.   General Stephen (4) \'an Rensselaer and  Harriet Elizabeth Bayard were married in  New York City, by Bishop Hobart, of the  Episcopal church, January 2, 1817. She was  burn in New York City, February 12, 1799,  and died in the Manor House at Albany, June  ly, 1875. She was the daughter of William  Bayard, who died September 18, 1826, who  married, (October 4, 1783, Elizabeth Cornell,  born in 1764, died at the Manor House, Al-  bany, January 17, 1854. William Bayard was  the son of Colonel William Bayard and Cath-  erine McEvers.   Colonel William Bayard was a prominent  and opulent merchant of New York City,  where he was born on June i, 1729, and died  at Southampton, England, in 1804. He re-  sided at Castle Point, Hoboken, New Jersey,  and, although hf joined the Sons of Liberty,  his estate was confiscated because his prin-  ciples would not permit him to aid the move-  ment for independence. He was a direct  descendant of Nicholas Bayard, born in Al-  phen. Holland, about 1644, who came to  America with the Dutch Governor, Pieter  Stuyvesant, landing at New Amsterdam on  May II, 1647, and died in New York in 1707.  He was mayor of New York in 1685, secre-  tary of the Province of New York in 1673,  and receiver-general in 1663. Colonel Will-  iam Bayard's wife, Catherine McEvers, was  born in 1732 and died in 1814. Mrs. Stephen  \'an Rensselaer was a woman of superior edu-  calif>n and culture, given to the most cordial  hospitality, and her life was consecrated to  kind acts. Following her death in 1875 there  was a division of the property among the  heirs, and the Manor House was closed for-  ever as a family habitation. In October, 1893,  the building was razed, and the land there-  abouts ])laced on the market. Twenty-five  years later it was the scene of a number of  maiuifacturing plants, and what were once  handsome grounds and a forest park were  bisected by spurs of railroad tracks.   The children of General Stephen \'an Rens-  selaer and Harriet Elizabeth Bayard were as  follows: I. Elizabeth Bayard, born at Albany,     bctober 4, 1817; died July 7, 1819. 2. Mar-  garet Schuyler, born at Albany May 12, 1819,  died there September 15, 1897; married (first)  at Albany, April 12, 1837, John DePeyster  Douw ; married (second) April 24, 1851, Wil-  mot Johnson. 3.

( VHI) Bayard, son of General .Ste])lien \'an  Rensselaer and Harriet Elizabeth Bayard, was  born at Albany. New York. September 8. 1833.  and died at Pau. France. January 12. 1859.  He was the third son and ninth child, but his  eldest brother died without issue, and his next  elder brother died in infancy before he was  born, hence the family name of William Bay-  ard, bestowed upon the infant, was carried  down by baptizing him Bayard. By birth,  culture and associations he was one of the  leaders in the most brilliant social set in Al-  bany, and belonged to a number of clubs and  organizations, among them the Burgesses'  Corps, then composed of the most prominent  young men in the city. His health being far  from robust, he sought to improve it by a sea  voyage in 1858 and a sojourn in the most in-  vigorating climate of France. Unfortunatelv.  the results were not as beneficial as expected,  for he died in France. He married, at the  bride's residence. No. 25 Pearl street.

(IX) William Bayard, oldest son of Bay-  ard \'an Rensselaer and Laura Reynolds, was  born in Albany, New York, October 4, 1856,  and died in Albany, September 25, 1909. He  was a direct lineal descendant of Kiliaen Win  Rensselaer, of Amsterdam, Holland, and had  not the laws of New York prohibited the en-  tailing of the property, he would have been  the eleventh Patroon, and owner of the Rens-  selaerswyck property.   In early boyhood, after returning from Eu-  rope, where he had been taken by his parents,  he went for a while to the Albany Boys'  Academy. A little later he was sent to a pri-  vate boarding school at Catskill, where he  spent two years, or until 1869, when, a boy of  thirteen, he went to St. Paul's School at Con-  cord, New Hampshire, where he remained for  six years, entering Harvard as a freshman in  1875. He was a graduate of the class of  1879 and then attended the Harvard Law  School. At' school, college and the law school  he was prominently identified with all the  leading societies and clubs. After leaving the  law school he entered the office of M. T. & L.  G. Hun, in Albany, and was admitted to the  bar in the fall of 1882, opening an office at  No. 25 Pearl street. Active duties of  a general counselor were to some extent set  aside in 1881 by Mr. Van Rensselaer's ap-  pointment as the one most suitable person  to have full charge of the Van Rensselaer  estate. His knowledge of the laws govern-  ing real estate and his conservative judg-  ment were a guarantee of most capable  management. In the fall of 1885. following  his suggestion, the many heirs of the late  General Stephen ^'an Rensselaer conveyed  their interest in the Albany property to the  Van Rensselaer Land Company, and he was  made treasurer, which office he continued  to hold until his death. Mr. Van Rensselaer  became a director of the New York State  National Bank in 1885, and was made its  vice-president in 1900. He was elected a  trustee of the Albany Savings Bank in 1883,     vice-president in 1897. His grandfather.  General Stephen Van Rensselaer, had been  the first president of this bank when char-  tered, March 25, 1820. As chairman of the  building committee he devoted untiring  energy to the erection of the handsome new  edifice which was ojiened April 25, 1899.  On August 15, 1900, about a month after  the death of J. Howard King, he was elected  the bank's president, and was its chief ex-  ecutive through a texm of years the most  successful in its long and remarkable his-  tory. In 1901 he was chosen chairman of  the executive committee of the Savings  Banks Association of the State of New  York, and on May 12, 1904, was elected  president of that body because of his widely  recognized ability and conservatism. In  1893 he organized the Albany Terminal  \\'arehouse Company, and a large building  was erected on the Van Rensselaer property  in the north part of the city, part of which  was used as a bonded warehouse. He was  a director of the Cohoes Company, incorpo-  rated in 1823, by his grandfather, which  supplies all the factories of Cohoes, New  York, with their water power. On organ-  ization of the Union Trust Company, he  was made its vice-president, and he was also  a trustee for numerous estates, giving close  attention to their careful management.  Among various appointments in rendering  ]Hiblic service was his appointment by Gov-  ernor Morton on the Albany Bi-Centennial  Celebration Committee, and he was named  by Governor Hughes one of the state's rep-  resentatives on the Hudson-Fulton Com-  mission in 1909. He was one of the organ-  izers and charter members of the Fort  Orange Club of Albany, a member of the  Albany Country Club and of the Albany  Institute and Historical and Art Society ;  also a member of the Holland Society. Re-  form Club and University Club of New  York City. He was on the board of trus-  tees of the New York State Normal Col-  lege and of the Rensselaer Polytechnic In-  stitute, also one of the officers of the Al-  bany Chamber of Commerce. In politics  Mr. \^an Rensselaer was a Republican, but  at times asserted his independence. Though  repeatedly urged to accept, yet he never  sought or held political office. As a thought-  ful man, he was, however, much interested in     i6     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     governmental ati'airs. To the advancement  of the Cathedral of All Saints, as one of the  chapter, he gave his best endeavor, promot-  ing the work of securing the new and hand-  some edifice. He traveled extensively, going  abroad a number of summers, and in the  winter season entertained with great fre-  quency at his home. No. 385 State street,  all dis'tinguished visitors coming to Albany,  being met at his table. His house was fur-  nished with many of the articles once be-  longing to his ancestors.   Mr. \'an Rensselaer married, at Cam-  bridge. Massachusetts, November 3, 1880,  Louisa Greenough Lane. She was born at  Cambridge, November 21, i860, and still  lives, residing in Albany. Her father was  Professor George Martin Lane, of Harvard  University, born in Charleston, December  24. 1826. died in Cambridge, June 30, 1897,  son of Martin Lane and Lucretia Swan.  Her mother was Frances Eliza Gardiner,  born at Shelter Island. New York, July 31,  1828; died in Cambridge, August 31, 1876,  daughter of Samuel G. Gardiner, and Mary  Catherine L'Hommedieu.   (IX) Howard Van Rensselaer, M. D., son  of Bayard. Van Rensselaer and Laura Rey-  nolds, was born at No. 98 Columbia street,  Albany, New York, June 26. 1858. Before  he was a year old he was taken abroad liy  his parents, returning in 1859. on the death  of his father, when he was but nine months  old. He was placed in the State Normal  School at Albany to learn the elementary  branches, and later changed to the Albany  Boys' Academy. Remaining there a short  time, he was sent to Miss Gaylord's pri-  vate boarding-school at Catskill, New York,  noted for its excellent moral training. When  twelve years old he entered St. Paul's  School at Concord, New Hampshire, where  he pursued his literary studies witli especial  diligence, and was made an e^litor of The  llorac. While here he was an enthusiastic  athlete. He established the one- and three-  mile walking records, which still remain un-  beaten. He was stroke oar on the success-  ful crew, was on the first eleven of the  cricket club, and was president of the .Ath-  letic Association. At the age of eighteen he  entered Yale, taking the Sheflield Scientific  course preparatory to the study of medicine,  and graduating in i88t with the degree of     Ph.B. He was also a student of the Yale  Art School, took a literary prize, and was a  member of the Berzelius Society, the oldest  scientific society in this country. After his  graduation from Yale he immediately en-  tered the College of Physicians and Sur-  geons in New York City, then under Drs.  Clark, Sands, and Dalton, graduating in  1884. During this period of three years he  attended all the courses of lectures and read  with avidity in every spare moment. He  was made the interne at the Chambers  Street Hospital, where he gained practical  knowledge of medical science. After that  he passed the severe competitive examina-  tion which entitled him to the position so  much to be desired by the aspiring student  of medicine, of house physician at the New  York Hospital, for a service of eighteen  months. While still studying in New York  he entertained the idea of visiting Europe  with a view of studying disease in its va-  rious forms and symjjtoms and the modes of  treatment adopted by the celebrated physi-  cians. He crossed to Germany in January,  1887, and visited all the great hospitals of  Europe excepting those of Spain, studying  in the large ones in Berlin, Paris, Vienna,  Munich, London and Edinburgh. Two  years were thus spent, and at intervals he  made side trips as opportunity opened, see-  ing sights in the Old World from the North  Cape to Constantinople and Greece. He re-  turned from abroad in February, 1889, and  opened an office in his native city. He was  at once appointed visiting physician to St.  Peter's Hospital, and the dispensary of the  Child's Hospital. In the fall of 1889 he was  ajipointed instructor of nervous diseases  and diseases of the chest at the Albany  Medical College of Union University. In  December, 1889, he was given the position  of attending physician to the Hospital for  Incurables, and in January, 1890, was  elected visiting physician to the Home of  the Friendless. In June of the same year  he was called to the position of lecturer  on materia medica at the Albany Medical  College. In 1892 he was advanced to the  position of associate professor of materia  medica. In 1894 he was elected full profes-  sor of materia medica and therapeutics, and  associated professor of the practice of medi-  cine, positions which he still holds. He is     SOUTHERX NEW YORK     17     a member of the Medical Society of Albany  county, the New York State Medical So-  ciety, and is vice-president of the American  Therapeutic Society; also, of the Fort  O'-ange, Albany Country and Albany  C imera Clubs, the Chamber of Commerce,  tl e Albany Institute and Historical and Art  Society, and likewise of the Calumet Club of  New York City. He was a prime mover in  establishing the Country Club, and has been  for many years its president. Dr. Van  Rensselaer has written a number of notable  scientific papers, which have been published  and widely read. He was editor of the  Alba)iy Medical Annals for six /years. He is  a medical examiner for several prominent life  insurance companies, and gives his services  as the attending physician of four Albany  hospitals and two charitable institutions.  He has been for several years president of  the Albany Boys' Club. Besides his visits  to Europe, he has traveled extensively on  the American continent, touring the Rocky  Mountain and Yellowstone regions, Cuba,  the Bahamas and Mexico. In 1909 he la-  bored assiduously to establish a Red Cross  Hospital for Consumptives, and raised  single-handed the fund which covered the  erection of the original buildings, the large  area of land for the site of which he con-  tributed. It has grown to be one of ^he  most appreciated institutions in the city,  and as a department of the Alluiny Hospital,  which it became, will endure as a valued  testimonial to his efforts for his fellow-riti-  zens. He holds the position of medical di-  rector for this institution.   (VIII) Eugene, youngest child of General  Stephen (4) and Harriet E. (Bayard) Van  Rensselaer, was born October 12, 1840, at  Albanv, New York, and now resides at  Berkeley Springs. West Virginia. He mar-  ried, at Baltimore.

Stephen V^n Rensselaer, only  son of Eugene and Sarah (Pendleton) Vaii  Renssc aer. was born January 7, 1869, in     Albany, and received a liberal education,  studying at Dresden, Germany, Paris,  France, Eton College, England, and Har-  vard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts.  He pursued his theological course at the  Episcopal Theological School of Cambridge,  and became assistant rector of Grace  Church, New York City. He was subse-  quetly vicar of St. Helena's Chapel, New  Lenox, Massachusetts; rector of St. John's  Church, Monticello, New York; rector of  St. Eustace Church, of Lake Placid, New  York ; minister of Calvary Church, Burnt  Hills, New York ; rector of St. Paul's  Church, Sidney, New York; and is now  (1913) temporarily assisting at Bethesda  Church, Saratoga, New York. He received  the degree of Bachelor of Arts from Har-  vard in 1891, and that of Bachelor of Di-  vinity from the Episcopal Theological  School in 1897. He is chaplain of the St.  Nicholas Society of New York ; a member  of the Harvard Club of New York ; and the  College fraternity. Taking the interest of  a good citizen in the progress of his coun-  try, he acts politically with the Republican  party.   He married, at Lenox, Massachusetts,  October 10, 1900, Mary Thorn Carpenter,  born March 18, 1871, at Poughkeepsie, New  York, daughter of Jacob Boekee and Sarah  E. (Thorn) Carpenter, died October 12,  1902, in New York.     The American Tucker-  TUCKERMAN mans are descended   from the English fam-  ily of that name long settled in Devonshire,  where the name may be traced in the hun-  dreds of Coleridge and Stanborough to the  reign of Henry VI. In the seventeenth  century they were considerable land own-  ers, and intermarried with the families of  Giles of Snowden, of Sir Edward Harris and  the Fortescues.   Two brothers, Otho and John, emigrated  to Massachusetts Bay in 1649, and from  them all the American Tuckermans are de-  scended. Otho, the elder brother, was one  of the early settlers of Portsmouth. New  Hampshire, He was a sea captain, and was  lost with his vessel. May 24, 1664. He was  the ancestor of four generations of ship-  masters who sailed out of Portsmouth and     SOUTHERN NE\\' YORK     also of Nathaniel, born in 1786, who re-  moved to South Carolina and built a house  in Charleston, which still stands at the cor-  ner of South Battery and Legare street.  The last owner of this house was a Miss  Tuckerman, who married (first) an Os-  borne, and (second) a Lowndes. Tucker-  man W' harf, Tuckerman Island and Tucker-  man Hill mark the presence of Otho's  descendants in New Hampshire. Tucker-  man's Ravine in the White Mountains was  named after Professor Edward Tuckerman,  a distinguished descendant of Otho's  brother John.   (I) John Tuckerman, tlie younger of the  two brothers who came to America from  England in 1649 and landed in Massachu-  setts Bay, was born in Devonshire in 1624,  died December 27, 1674. He was the an-  cestor of the Tuckerman family associated  with Boston and New York City. It is  known that he was a man of education and  of studious habit of mind, bringing^ witli  him to this country a collection of books  quite exceptional in the colony, some of  which have been preserved in the family.  Before his emigration he had been a mem-  ber of the Church of England, and during  his life in Massachusetts Bay he retained  his Anglican sympathies. The circum-  stance placed him at odds with the Puritan  theocracy then forming, but he handed  down his sentiments to his descendants, and  his grandson became a founder of an Epis-  copal church as soon as that form of wor-  .ship was permitted in the province. He had  a son bearing the .same name as himself.   (II) John (2), son of John (i) Tucker-  man who was the first of the family in  America, was born in Boston, Massachu-  setts. OctoI)er 8. 1655. He served through-  nut King Philip's war, 1675-76, being se-  verelv wounded at the fight 'at Sudburv, in  Captain Wadsworth's company, and was  present at the Great Swamp fight in Rhode  Island. The Narragansett townships, sit-  uated near the boundary of Massachusetts  and New Hampshire, were granted by the  general court of Massachusetts Bay to the  soldiers who had served in King 'Philip's  war. The lands allotted to John Tucker-  man now form part of the 'townships of  Bedford and Merrimac, and al.so part of the  town of Manchester. New Hampshire.     These grants were then a wilderness, but  afterwards became valuable to his descend-  ants.   By his first marriage, in 1680, John Tuck-  erman had a son, John, the third of that  name in this country, who married Hannah  Gent, in- 1708, and left his 'mansion house,'  his silver watch and silver-hilted sword to  his own son, John, fourth of that name.  This last-named John was born in 1716, and  has the distinction of being mentioned in the  celebrated 'Diary of Chief Justice Sewall,'  in a passage often cited as illustrating the  hardiliood and religious strictness of the  New England people :   'Lord's Day, Jan'y 15. An extraordinary cold  .storm of wind and snow. Blows much worse as  coming home at noon and so holds on. Bread was  frozen at the Lord's Table : Mr. Pemberton admin-  istered. Came not out to the afternoon exercise.  Tliough 'twas so cold, yet John Tuckerman was  baptized. At six o'clock my ink freezes so that I  can hardly write by a good fire in my wife's cham-  ber. Yet was comfortable at meeting. — Laiis Deo.'   The second marriage of John Tuckerman  occurred November 14, 1693, at the First  Church, Boston, to Susannah, daughter of  Edmund Chamberline, whose family had been  settled at Roxbury and Woburn before  1650. By this second marriage he had two  sons, Abraham and Edward. The first of  these married a daughter of the Rev. W.  Welstede, and he had a son named Abra-  ham, who served as an oflRcer in the Ameri-  can revolution, being present as captain at  the battle of Saratoga, and was with Gen-  eral W'ashington's army for several vears,  including tlie winter at Valley Forge, re-  tiring with the rank of adjutant. Regard-  ing the second son, Edward, see forward.   (HI) Edward, second son of John (2)  and Susannah (Chamberline) Tuckerman,  was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1699,  died in 1751. He became a successful mer-  chant. The Suffolk registry showed him  to have possessed nine pieces of real estate  in Boston, and he had al.so his share of the  Narragansett townships granted to his  father. The Anglican sympathies inherited  from his grandfather gave him an active in-  terest in the foundation of Trinity Church,  of which he was an original proprietor in  1734. Edward Tuckerman married. June 21,  1738. Dorothy, daughter of Joseph Kidder,  and great-granddaughter of James Kidder,     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     19     who settled at Billerica in 1640. Her  mother's maiden name was Dorothy Dows.  Both the Kidder and Dows famihes became  Church of England people ; Dorothy Kid-  der's first cousin, Joseph Dows, being a  warden of Trinity from its foundation to  his death, in 1764. When Edward Tucker-  man died, he left a son named Edward, see  forward.   (IV) Edward (2), son of Edward (i) and  Dorothy (Kidder) Tuckerman, was born  December 29. 1740, died July 22, 1818. He  was a grain merchant and was regarded as  the chief authority on the production and  prices of that commodity in New England.  Chosen at the town meeting held in Boston  in 1782 to the office of surveyor of wheat,  he was re-elected almost continuously until  his death, a period of thirty-seven years. In  1771 he received from Governor Hutchinson  a commission as lieutenant in the Boston  Artillery Company, which he resigned at the  outbreak of the revolution. He served with  Washington's army in the campaign about  Boston, and afterwards acted as disbursing  officer for the state of Massachusetts in the  grants of money mjide for the Continental  army. In 1798 he was one of the founders  of -the first fire insurance company in New  England, if not in America, the Massachu-  setts Mutual, and later was one of the  founders of the Massachusetts General Hos-  pital. He was three times elected a mem-  ber of the general court of Massachusetts.  His portrait, executed by Sharpless in pas-  tel, is preserved in the family. Edward  Tuckerman married, February 20, 1766,  Elizabeth, daughter of Stephen Harris. The  house on Orange street, which he built in  1770. was of the Colonial type, of the most  substantial construction, and was standing,  as good as new, a hundred years later. In  the siege of Boston a cannon-ball struck it.  and was embedded in an exterior beam,  where for many years it was an object of  curious observation. Children:   I. Elizabeth, born 1768, died 1829. She mar-  ried Stephen Salisbury, of Worcester, Mas-  sachusetts, the grandfather of the Stephen  Salisbury who died in 1905, leaving to his  native town a fortune of six million dollars.  In the Art Gallerv at Worcester hang two  fine portraits of Elizabeth Tuckerman, one  by Gilbert Stuart and the other by Harding.     2. Edward (the third of that name in di-  rect descent), born February 13, 1775, died  May 29, 1843. He was one of the leading  merchants of Boston and a partner of Rob-  ert Gould Shaw. He founded the Provident  Institution for Savings in 1816, the first sav-  ings bank in the United States except the  Philadelphia Savings Fund Association,  which claims to have begun business one  month earlier. Associated with him in or-  ganizing this institution were William Phil-  lips, Samuel Parkman, John Lowell, Russell  Sturgis, Jonathan Russell, Josiah Quincy,  Dr. \\'illiam E. Channing, Charles Lowell,  Elisha Ticknor, Jonathan Amory Jr., Joseph  Coolidge Jr., Thomas Motley, Lewis Tap-  pan and James Savage. He was also a di-  rector of the Massachusetts Bank from 1810  to 1841 ; a trustee of the Massachusetts Gen-  eral Hospital, and for several years was  president of that corporation ; chairman of  the board of managers of the Boston Dis-  pensary ; trustee of the Massachusetts Bible  Society, and in 1841 a delegate to the meet-  ing of the British and Foreign Bible Society  in London ; an original subscriber and pro-  prietor of the Boston Athenaeum, in 1807;  a justice of the peace and an overseer of the  poor. At the town meeting held in Faneuil  Hall, January 22, 1821, the thanks of the  town were voted to him for his services ren^  dered in that office. He was a proprietor of  St. Paul's Church, and a vestryman thereof  from 1827 until his death in 1843. Edward  Tuckerman married (first) December 19.  1798, Hannah, daughter of Sarah Shaw and  Samuel Parkman. He married (second)  January 28, 1817, Sophia, daughter of Colo-  nel John May, one of the patriots who  threw the tea overboard in Boston Harbor,  in 1773, and a major in the army of the  Comte de Rochambeau. He resided at No.  33 Beacon street, Boston, on land purchased  from the heirs of John Hancock. His • t-  trait and that of his first wife and two of his  second wife were painted by Gilbert Stuart.  There is also a bust of him by a French  sculptor and two miniatures, one by Grim-  aldi and one by Rogers. Sons: i. Edward  (fourth of that name in direct descent), born  in Boston, Massachusetts, December 7, 1817,  died in .Amherst, Massachusetts, March 15,  1886. He was a distinguished botanist,  specializing in lichenology. He graduated     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     at Union College in 1837, and afterwards at  Harvard, and the Harvard Law and Divin-  ity schools. In 1841 he studied in Europe  with the botanist, Elias Fries, and in 1842  explored the White Mountains with the  celebrated Asa Gray, making the discovery  of the ravine which bears his name. In  1854 he became connected with Amherst as  lecturer on history; in 1858 he became pro-  fessor of botany, which chair he held until  his death. His botanical papers number  about fifty and describe the lichens not only  of New England, but of other parts of North  America. Specimens collected by the Unit-  ed States exploring expedition, the Pacific  railroad surveys, and by the United States  geological surveys were referred to him for  examination and classification. Thomas  Nuttall dedicated to him the genus Tucker-  mania, one of the finest of California Com-  po.sitae, and several species have been named  in his honor. He was a member of many  scientific .societies, and received the degree  of LL.D. from Amherst. Memoirs of him  were written by William G. Farlow and Asa  Gray. ii. Samuel Parkman, born in Boston,  Massachusetts, February 11, 1819, died at  Newport, Rhode Island, June 30. 1890. He  was a composer of church music, and the  only American composer whose composi-  tions are used in the English cathedrals.  In 1849 he went to England and for several  years studied and performed in the cathe-  drals of Canterbury, York, Durham and  Salisbury. In 1851 he received from the  archbishops of Canterbury the Lambeth de-  gree of Doctor of Music, being the first  American to receive it. In the next vear he  was elected a fellow of the Pontifical Con-  gregation and the Academy of Saint Cecilia  at Rome. He published 'Cathedral Chants'  and the 'Trinity Collection' of church mu-  sic. A list of his compositions is to be found  in Novello's catalogues, iii. Frederick God-  dard, born in Boston, Massachusetts, Febru-  ary 4, 1821. He published a volume of  'Poems' in i860: was a friend of Tennv.son,  and when a guest of the latter at the Isle of  Wight was eiven the original manuscrint of  'Locksley Hall.' He left a son. Dr. Fred-  erick Tuckerman. anatomist, of Amherst,  Massachusetts.   3. Joseph, see forward.   4. Henry Harris, b(irn in 1783, died at     Newport, Rhode Island, in 1S60. He was a  merchant of Boston. He married Ruth  Keating, who died in 1823. Sons: i. Henry  Theodore, born in Boston, Massachusetts,  April 20, 1813, died in New York City, De-  cember 17, 1871. He was a prolific and  popular author in the fields of travel, biog-  raphy and criticism. Harvard bestowed on  him the honorary degree of Master of Arts  in 1850, and in recognition of his labors on  behalf of Italian exiles in the United States  he was decorated by King Victor Emman-  uel. He was corresponding member of the  Massachusetts Historical Society, and ac-  tively interested in the New York Society.  His portrait was painted by Daniel Hunt-  ington, and he appears in the engraving  called 'Washington Irving and His Literary  Friends at Sunnyside,' which gathers to-  gether so many honored figures in our liter-  ary history. Although much younger than  Irving, he was for many years an intimate  friend. He never married, and the place of  domestic life was taken by friendships and  social connections in New York and New-  port of an unusually wide and interesting  character. His early visits to Italy resulted  in 'The Italian Sketch Book,' 1835, and  'Sicily, a Pilgrimage,' 1839; later followed  'Rambles and Reveries,' 1841 ; 'Thoughts  on the Poets,' 1846: 'Artist Life, or Sketches  of American Painters,' 1847: 'Characteris-  tics of Literature,' 1851 ; 'Poems.' 1851;  'A Month in England,' 1853: 'Memorial of  Grecnough,' 1853: 'Leaves from the Diary  of a Dreamer,' 1853; 'Essays Biographical  and Critical,' 1857; 'Essay on Washington,  and the Portraits of Washington,' 1859;  'America and Her Commentators,' 1864;  'A Sheaf of Verse,' 1864; 'The Criterion,'  1866: 'Magna Papers about Paris,' 1867:  'Life of John P. Kennedy,' 1871. The work  upon which his reputation now chiefly rests  is 'The Book of Artists,' published in 1867.  This is a permanent contribution to our lit-  erature, containing very much information  concerning the history of American art  which must have been lost without the re-  search and study given by him, and he was  especially qualified for the task. Always  sympathetic with the work and life of art-  ists, a constant and welcome visitor at their  studios, ready to lend a hand in any diffi-  culty, he had many intimates among them     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     and gathered a mass of information not to  l)e acquired in any other way. His book  remains the best authority, a source of in-  formation constantly consulted, and a com-  mentary of great interest and literary charm,  ii. Charles Keating, born in Boston, March  II, 1821, died in Florence, Italy, February  26, 1896. He served as United States min-  ister to Greece from 1868 to 1872, and re-  ceived from King George the decoration of  the Order of the Saviour. In 1867 he edited  Rangabe's 'Greece, Her Progress and Pres-  ent Position,' and he was the author of  'The Greeks of To-day,' 1873; 'Poems,'  1885; and 'Personal Recollections of Not-  able People,' 1895. He married Mary  Fleming, daughter of William Gracie, of  New York, by whom two sons : Fleming,  born December 17, 1858, a member of the  New York bar, who married Edith A. Coz-  zens, and has a son, Arthur, and Arthur  Lvman. born September 14, i86t, author of  'A Short History of Architecture,' and 'A  Study of Vignola.'   5. Gustavus, see forward.  (V) Rev. Dr. Joseph Tuckerman, son of  Edward (2) and Elizabeth (Harris) Tucker-  man, was born in the homestead on Orange  street in Boston, Massachusetts, January 28,  1778, died April 20. 1840. He became dis-  tinguished as a philanthropist, whose works  and reputation survive to the present time.  He received his early education at the Bos-  ton Latin School, and at Phillip's Academy,  Andover, Massachusetts. He entered Har-  vard College in 1794, at the age of seven-  teen. Among his classmates were Josiah  Salisbury, Stephen Longfellow, the father  of the poet, Joseph Story, afterwards justice  of -the supreme court, who was his room-  mate, and William Ellery Channing, his life-  long friend. His father having severed his  connection with Trinity Church at the out-  break of the revolution, because the clergy  persisted in reading the prayers for King  George, Joseph was brought up in the Con-  gregational church, and was ordained a min-  ister of that denomination in 180T. but in  later life, in company with William E.  Channing, he took part in the Unitarian  movement. He received the honorary de-  gree of S. T. D. from Harvard College in.  1826. The Tuckerman School in Boston  was named for him. The philanthropic     work which gave Dr. Tuckerman a reputa-  tion both in America and also in Europe  was accomplished while acting as minister-  at-Iarge in Boston. In the early years of  the nineteenth century the problem of deal-  ing with poverty and its attendant evils was  new, but constantly becoming more press-  ing. Dr. Tuckerman recognized two as-  pects of the subject, the religious and the  civic. In the former he labored with un-  usual aptitude and enthusiasm, but by no  means alone. It is to the latter that he  made contributions so original and lasting  that his usefulness and his reputation have  endured beyond his own day. He pointed  out the distinction between pauperism and  poverty, and introduced the principles of  modern organized charity. In the modern  philanthropic movement he was a pioneer,  and he based his labors upon principles  which he was among the earliest to recog-  nize, and of which the wisdom has been  accepted by succeeding generations. Con-  cerning this work it was said by Justice  Story: 'It entitles him to a prominent  rank among the benefactors of mankind,'  and Dr. William E. Channing voiced the  opinion : 'He is to be ranked among the  benefactors of this city and the world.'  Such words of praise from Dr. Tuckerman's  contemporaries are borne out by statements  of men in the succeeding generation. 'Jos-  eph Tuckerman,' said Dr. Edward Everett  Hale, in 1874,   'has been revered in Boston for a generation past  as one of its benefactors. To the system inaugurat-  ed by him it may fairly be said that Boston owes it  that in every revulsion of business, or in any great  calamity, her ordinary institutions of charitable re-  lief have proved sufficient for whatever exigency.  To those systems the city of Boston owes it that  there does not exist in her borders any focus of  misery and crime — the dread of the authorities of  government and the shame of the ministers of re-  ligion. Poverty, crime and pauperism there are in  Boston ; but for the most part they may be regarded  not as chronic nor as endemic ; but as, to a large ex-  tent, importations from without, or abnormal and  e.xceptional. This happy condition may be fairly  said to be in a large measure the result of the views  which Dr. Tuckerman inculcated, and of the plans  which he suggested.'   Seventy-five years after the beginning of  Dr. Tuckerman's work in Boston, the anni-  versary was commemorated by a gathering  of clergymen and philanthropists. On this     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     occasion it was said by Rev. Samuel A.  Eliot :   'Joseph Tuckerman was a seed-sower. There was  nothing imitative in his enterprise. It was not the  repetition of something that had been done a hun-  dred times before. It was fruitfully original, it  had in it the prophetic element. * * * His work  constitutes an epoch in the history of human help-  fulness Therefore it enlisted and still enlists the  enthusiastic and patient devotion of consecrated men  and women. Therefore it became the promoter ot  numberless similar enterprises in other fields.   On the same occasion it was said by Rev.  Francis G. Peabody:   'Xow. when did this renaissance of philanthropy,  this age of the social question, begin? It is, of  course quite impossible to fix a single moment as the  positive starting point of this new wave of modern  interest; but if we were to select any points from  which to date, one of them would undoubtedly be the  dav which we are here celebrating. In a most re-  markable degree Dr. Tuckerman anticipated the  spirit of the new philanthropy, and in the founding  of this ministrv-at-large fixed one starting point of  the modern movement. He anticipated in the most  extraordinary degree all the principles of modern,  scientific charity. He discussed all the problems  which are now confronting the modern world, and  offered wise and prophetic answers to them.   In France Dr. Tuckerman's principles  were adopted by Baron Degerando and his  followers, and in England they resulted in  the Tuckerman Institute of Liverpool and  other institutions which still survive. An  account of Dr. Tuckerman's work was writ-  ten by Dr. William E. Channing. Dr. Tuck-  erman lived at No. 5 Mt. Vernon place,  Boston, Massachusetts, almost directly be-  hind No. 33 Beacon street, the home of his  brother, Edward. There are several por-  traits of him, of which the principal ones  are that 1)y Gilbert Stuart in possession of  the family, that by Alexander in Memorial  Hall, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and that  by Butler in the Unitarian Building, Boston.  Rev. Dr. Joseph Tuckerman married (first)  in 1803, Abigail, daughter of Saiuuel Parkman,  the sister of Mrs. Edward Tuckerman and a  half-sister of Rev. Francis Parkman, the fa-  ther of the celebrated historian, and of Mrs.  Robert Gould Shaw. He married (second)  November 3. 1808, Sarah, daughter of Sam-  uel Gary, of the Retreat, Chelsea. The  Carys were descended from a younger  branch of the Devonsliire family, of which  Lord Hunsdon was the head. William Cary  was mayor of Bristol, England, in 1546, and  his grandson, William, was mayor of the     same city in 161 1. The son of William,  named James, emigrated to Massachusetts  in 1639. Dr. Tuckerinan's brother-in-law,  Thomas G. Cary, married a daughter of  Colonel Thomas H. Perkins, and he was  the father of Mrs. Louis Agassiz, so well  known as the wife of the great scientist and  later as founder and president of Radclift'e  College. By the second marriage Dr. Jos-  eph Tuckerman had a son, Joseph, born  June 29, 181 1, died July 19, 1898; a second  son, Samuel Cary, born in 1815, died in  1870, who left a son, J. Willard ; a third son,  Lucius, see forward.   (V'l) Lucius, son of Rev. Dr. Joseph and  Sarah (Cary) Tuckerman, was born in Bos-  ton, Massachusetts, March 19, 1818, died at  Stockbridge, Massachusetts, June 10, 1890.  He was a pioneer in the manufacture of  iron in the United States, and together with  his brother Joseph originated the metal  called Ulster iron, which on account of its  tensile strength filled requirements since  supplied by steel. He lived chiefly in New-  York City, at No. 22 Washington place, and  No. 220 Madison avenue. Later in life he  built the large house on the corner of Si.x-  teenth and I streets, Washington, in what  was then the Corcoran gardens, where he  had a fine collection of pictures, and with  his wife and daughters, Mrs. James Lown-  des and Miss Emily Tuckerman, exercised  a notable hospitality. His country seat was  at Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where he  died. He was vice-jiresident of the Metro-  politan Museum of Art, a life member of  the National Acadeiny of Design, and for  many years a trustee of the Children's Aid  Society. His portrait was painted by Mos-  cheles and by George B. Butler.   Lucius Tuckerman married, in New York  City, April 2, 1844, Elizabeth Wolcott, born  at .Sunswick, Astoria, New York, July 8,  1819, died at Stockbridge, Massachusetts,  .\ugust 25, TO06, daughter of Colonel George  Gibbs, of Newport, Rhode Island.

He was a son of Lieu-  tenant Thomas Lamb, who as a young man  served as first lieutenant in Colonel Henry  Jackson's regiment of the Continental Line.  He w'as chosen by Washington to carry a  message from Valley Forge to Boston for  supplies for the army, and the silver spurs  which General Washington removed from  his own heels to speed his 3'oung aide on his  long horseback journey are still treasured in  the famil3^ A portrait of Thomas Lamb  Jr., by Sully, painted when he was a young  man, hangs in the house of his son, Horatio  Appleton Lamb, of Boston, and another,  painted by his daughter.

Chil-  dren of Mr. and Mrs. Tuckerman: i. Jane  Francis, born in Boston, Massachusetts. 2.  Emily Lamb, born in Boston, Massachu-  setts. 3, Eliot, see forward.   (VH) Eliot, son of Gustavus (2) and  Emily G. (Lamb) Tuckerman, was born in  his father's house, No. 50 West Forty-fifth  street. New York City, March 12, 1872. He  received his education at Harvard Univer-  sity, being graduated from the college in  1894 and from the Law School in 1897. He  is a member of the New York bar.

He is  a trustee of the Morristown School.     \\'hile tradition is persistent  BISHOP in stating that this Bishop   family is descended from the  pioneers of Ipswich of this surname, and  the location of Dr. John Bishop at Brad-  ford, Massachusetts, in the same county, at  a time when no English settlers were com-  ing to America, supports this ancient be-  lief, it has been established beyond reason-  able doubt that Dr. Bishop himself came  from England. There is reason to think he  was the son of John Bishop, a linen draper  of London, whose wife Elizabeth was a  daughter of Rev. Samuel Lee, whose will  was dated in 1692 and who bequeathed to  his daughters Elizabeth, Ann and Lydia,  certain books of physics, chemistry and  medicine ; Rebecca married John Safifin, and  Lydia, John George of Boston, Massachu-  setts : his daughter Ann married Henry  Wyrly, of New Bristol, Connecticut. As  three of her sisters were in this country, it  is thought that Elizabeth or her children  followed them thither. It should be stated  that the Medford history is wrong in the  statement that Dr. John was a son of Sam-  uel (2), Thomas (i) Bishop, for the record     26     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     of this John, son of Samuel, is given in the  Converse genealogy elsewhere.   It is known that Dr. Bishop married  Sarah Bond, and that about 1717 he located  in Bradford, Massachusetts. He practiced  his profession there and at Medford, Massa-  chusetts, whither he went in 1723. He died  in 1739 and his widow Sarah appears to  have married, at Bradford, April 17, 1740,  William Hall. Children of Dr. John and  Sarah Bishop: Sarah, born at Bradford.  Tune II, 1720, married there April 26, 1738,  Benjamin Lathe; John, mentioned below.   (H) John (2), son of Dr. John (i)  Bishop, was born at Bradford, April 6, 1722,  and died in Medford, December, 1791, aged  about seventy years. He came to Medford  with his parents in 1723 and lived there all  his life, and until 1868 his descendants of  this surname were living there. His home  was on High street. He married, at Med-  ford. December 7, 1752. Abigail, daughter  of Dr. Simon Tufts. She was born at \Ied-  ford, September 22. 1728, died August 30,  1810, of one of the most prominent Charles-  town and Medford families. Her father, Dr.  Simon Tufts, was graduated from Harvard  College in 1724, and died January 31, 1747,  aged forty-seven years ; married, October  28. 1725. Abigail Smith, who died in 1790,  aged ninety years. Abigail Bishop was re-  lated to President John Adams' family.  Children, born at Medford: Abigail, born  October 5, 1753; married, November 12,  1786. Dr. Archelaus Putnam, of Danvers;  and John, mentioned below. Mrs. Bishop  joined President John Adams in a deed of  Charlcstown land in 1707. Washington and  .\dams were both visitors at the Bishop  homestead in Medford.   (HI) John (3), son of John (2) Bishop,  was born at Medford, November 20, 1755.  and died there February 8, 1833. He was a  prominent merchant and real estate owner  in Boston. He married Lydia Holmes, who  died April. 1807. aged forty-eight years,  daughter of Nathaniel and Rebecca ('Good-  will') Holmes. Her father was a prominent  merchant and real estate owner in Boston.  Her sister married William Fowle. Chil-  dren, born at Medford: i. Lydia. born  1784. baptized June 4, 1786. 2. Rebecca  Holmes, born October 20. 1785, died Octo-  ber 2fi, 1807. 3. John, born August 7. 1787,     died September 7, 1830. 4. Nathaniel  Holmes, mentioned below. 5. Eliza, born  January i, 1791. 6.

He inherited a large estate at  Medford and added to it substantially. He  died at Medford, February 22, 1850. He  married, October 21, 1824, Mary Smith Far-  rar, daughter of Dr. Judson Farrar, of Peter-  boro, New Hampshire, Mr. Bishop being  then of Boston. The marriage intention  was dated September 19, the marriage tak-  ing place October 21, 1824. Children, born  at Medford: i. Mary Rebecca, born De-  cember 7, 1829; baptized December 31. 2.

Harriette (or Henrietta)  Baker, baptized May 6, 1839. 8. Heber  Reginald, baptized May 3, 1840. 9. Maria  Josephine, born April 9, 1841.   (V) Heber Reginald, son of Nathaniel  Holmes Bishop, was born at Medford.  March 11. 1840. and was baptized there May  3, 1840. He attended the Cummings school  at Medford and the academy at North Yar-  mouth, Maine. Early in life he began a  commercial career. In the autumn of 1856  he entered the employ of Benjamin Burgess  & Sons, then prominent merchants in the  West India trade, at India Wharf, Boston,  and in the same year was sent to Remedios,  Cuba, to represent the house. In March,  1881, soon after he came of age, he estab-  lished himself in business in Cuba, export-  ing sugar and carrying on the usual banking  business with the planters. He was suc-  cessful and prospered until the insurrection  broke out in 1868. after which business was  carried on with great difficulty — labor was  scarce, and the sugar crop small for a num-  ber of years. In 1876 he finally left Cuba  and never returned.   He became interested in the rapid transit  problem of New York City and was promi-  nent with Benjamin Brewster and others in     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     27     organizing the company and building the  street railroad in New York. Naturally he  came to be interested in other railroads then  building in the western states. He was a  director of the St. Paul, Minneapolis &  Omaha Railroad Company; of the Chicago,  Rock Island & Pacific Railroad Company,  and the Duluth & Iron Range Railway Com-  pany, of which he was president. In 1887  he was one of the organizers of the Minne-  sota Iron Company, of which he became  president, and he was also a director of the  Chandler Iron Company, of the Lacka-  wanna Iron and Steel Company, and of the  new Lackawanna Steel Company. His in-  terests were very large in the iron properties  about Duluth. For many years he was a  trustee of the Metropolitan Trust Company  of New York City, and his ability, integrity  and business aptitude won for him the  respect and confidence of his associates.   He was active in various charities, and  for some years was vice-president of the  Presbyterian Hospital of New York. He  was a member of the Metropolitan, Unioii.  Union League, Century, Grolier and other  New York clubs, the Restigouche Salmon  Club and the Southside Sportsmen's Club,  and the Civil Service Reform Association,  and a director of the Chamber of Commerce,  the Metropolitan Museum of Natural His-  tory and of the Metropolitan ■Museum of  Art. At one time he was very active in the  reorganization of the Forty-second Street  Presbyterian Church. He was a life mem-  ber of the New York Genealogical and Bio-  graphical Society.   . His leisure was spent largely in travel.  In 1870 he made his first \-isit to the Pacific  coast, and he went again in 1880 and in  1890. In 1881 he spent five months in  Europe, and in 1883 and 1885 he travelled  extensively in France. England, Germany.  Austria, Russia and Spain. His taste for art  developed, and he began as early as 1880  his collection of jades and continued to add  to it at every opportunity. In 1888-89 he  was abroad most of the time and spent many  months in Italy and Turkey. In 1892 he  visited Japan and China and spent three  weeks in Pekin. His reputation as a con-  noisseur and collector had preceded him,  and he had special opportunities to see spec-  imens of jade and to add to his possessions.     In the autumn of 1892 he went to Europe  again, and in 1895 he spent two months in  Egypt and ascended the Nile to the Second  Cataract, and paid visits to the Holy Land,  Greece and Turkey. This was his second  visit to Constantinople. On his way home  he visited Sicily, Naples, Rome, and Paris.  In 1S83 he built the house on upper Fifth  avenue and made his home there until he  died. In 1895 he had constructed in his  house a fireproof room for his jade collec-  tion which had become larger than any  other in the world — larger even than the  famous collection in the British Museum.  Many of the stones were of great beauty  and value, and as a mineralogical and  archaeological collection it was and is in-  valuable. In March, 1902, this collection,  valued at half a million dollars, was pre-  sented by Mr. Bishop to the Metropolitan  Museum of Art, of which he was a  trustee for many years, providing that the  collection should remain in his house until  a similar room had been prepared for it in  the Museum. About the same time he com-  pleted a catalogue, a hundred copies of  which were printed after his death. This  work is an authority on the subject of jade,  and the book as well as the collection is a  memorial of the industry, learning and ar-  tistic spirit of Mr. Bishop.   He never lost his interest in business or  outdoor sports. In 1882, with General  Philip H. Sheridan, he made a trip to the  Rocky Mountains and travelled hundreds of  miles on horseback in hunts for big game,  and made several similar trips with other  friends. He always enjoyed his visits to the  Restigouche Club, and the comforts of  shooting in England and France. In 1899  he rented an estate in Norfolk, England,  and during the shooting season entertained  many from France and the United States.  His last trip abroad was made in 1902, and  he enjoyed visits and shooting in Scotland.  Returning to New York in October, he was  attacked by heart disease in November, and  after an illness of about six weeks died De-  cember 10, 1902. He was sixty-two years  old, but young in feeling and appearance, if  not in years. His generosity, kindness and  attractive personality made for him friends  in all classes and in manv countries.   He married, in 1862. Mary Cunningham,     28     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     second daughter of James Cunningham, who  came to this country from Scotland in 1822.  After his marriage he spent several winters  in Cuba, and the summers at Irvington-on-  Hudson, New York. In 1870 he made his  home at Irvington, and lived there until the  house was burned in 1878.

John Hancock,  the famous governor of Massachusetts, was  a descendant of Nathaniel Hancock, who  settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as  earlv as 1634. Another John Hancock came  with the Scotch-Irish and located in Haver-  hill, Massachusetts, about 1750, removing  thence to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and  finally to Buxton, Maine. Various branches  of the familv in England bear coats-of-arms.  Richard Hancock, of Philadelphia, died of  the ship-fever. He had been, it is said, a  victim of the British policy of searching  American ships and seizing American sail-  ors, and was imprisoned for some time in  England after he was seized by the British.     He married (second) Anna Alaria Nash, born  in Edinburgh, Scotland, June 28, 177 — . After  her husband died the widow apprenticed or  'bound out' her children, and she died  about 1822.

(Ill) Edward, son of John Hoxworth, was  born September 22, 1760, at Montgomery,  Pennsylvania, and died January 11, 1847.  He was a member of the Baptist church of  Montgomery. His home was in Hatfield,  on land partly inherited and partly acquired  by purchase. He enlisted at the age of fif-  teen in the revolutionary war, and in his last  years was a pensioner.

He was small,  lithe and active, and it is said of him that  he could leap over a horse. At the age of  seventy he could still do a hard day's work  in the fields.

There are parishes and places  MORTON in counties Derby, Lincoln,   Yorkshire. Warwick, Dur-  ham. Norfolk, Hereford and Northampton,  in England, bearing the name of Morton.  Lower says that, in the case of the Mortons  of English ori£;in. the name probably comes  from the appellations of these localities.  Others have found a Norman origin for the  name. The name of Morton, Moreton, or  Mortaigne. say they, is earliest found in old  Dauphine, and is still existent in France,  where it is represented by the present  Comtes and Marquises Morton de Chabril-  lon, and where the family has occupied  many important positions.     In the annals of the family there is said  to ])e a statement frequently met with that,  as the result of a quarrel, one of the name  emigrated from Dauphine, first to Brittany  and then to Normandy, where he joined  William the Conqueror at the time of his in-  vasion of England. Certain it is that among  the names of the followers of William,  painted on the chancel ceiling of one of the  churches of Dives in old Normandy, is that  of Robert Comte de Mortaigne. The name  also figures on the Battle Abbey Rolls, the  Domesday Book and the Norman Rolls of  England, and it is conjectured that this  Comte Robert, who was also half brother  to the Conqueror by his mother Charlotte,  was the father of the English family of the  name, or at least of the higher family bear-  ing the name. Count Robert held manors  in nearly every county in England, in all  about eight hundred. Cardinal Morton was  a privy councillor and a faithful adherent of  Flenrv VI. Edward IV. had made him his  lord chancellor and his executor. Richard  III. had thrown him into prison, but he had  escaped in time to plan the enterprise which  proved successful at Bosworth Field, and to  him Henry VII. owed his throne. Promi-  nent among the English Mortons who early  came to America were Thomas Morton, the  Reverend Charles Morton, Landgrave Jos-  eph Morton and George Morton.   (I) John Morton, the progenitor in Ire-  land of the Morton family here dealt with,  was probably born in county Antrim, Ire-  land, and died there in the latter part of the  eighteenth century. He probably belonged  to the Mortons, who had derived their sur-  name in the manner described above, and  his progenitors had probably settled in Ire-  land at the time of the various confiscations  of property in that country. They may  have come direct from England, or by way  of Scotland. The family was Protestant in  religion. John Morton lived at Dawson's  Bridge, county Antrim, Ireland. The names  of his wife and most of his children remain  unknown.   (II) John (2), son of John (i) Morton, of  Dawson's Bridge, county Antrim. Ireland,  w^as probably born at Dawson's Bridge  about 1729, died at Basking Ridge, New Jer-  sey, in the spring of 1781. He came to  America with the British army in 1750, and     30     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     in 1761 settled in New York City. He is  said to have been known among his army  friends as 'Handsome Johnny.' Later when  he joined the patriotic side in the war of in-  dependence he contributed largely to that  cause as the 'rebel banker.' When the oc-  cupation of New York by the British was  threatened in 1774, he removed his family  first to Elizabethtown and later to Basking  Ridge, New Jersey. He married, in 1760,  at New York City, Maria Sophia Kemper.  He had eight children, one of whom was  Jacob, of whom further.   (HI) Jacob, son of John (2) and Maria  Sophia (Kemper) Morton, was born in New  York City, in 1762, died suddenly in New  York City, in 1836. Jacob Morton was well  known in New York in his time. He was  the messenger sent to procure the Bible, on  which General Washington took the oath as  president of the United States, when he was  inaugurated in New York. Afterwards in  1778 he was in command of a corps of artil-  lery, and for a number of years was a major-  general of the militia in New York. He was  a clerk in the common council for more than  twenty years, and before holding that posi-  tion held numerous other ofifices. He was a  faithful and capable officer, a pleasant, polite  and well-bred gentleman of the old school,  respected and beloved by all who knew him.  Always ready with a helping hand he helped  his friends whenever they applied to him,  and had a large circle of acquaintances of  varying degrees of intimacy. He presented  a large punch bowl to the city of New York,  which is now in the Metropolitan Museum  of that city. His portrait is in the gover-  nor's room in the City Hall, New York.   He married, in New York, Catherine,  daughter of Carey and Hester (Lansing)  Ludlow. Children : John Ludlow, married  Kmilv Ellison; George William, married  Caroline Denning: Charles Ferdinand, mar-  ried Henrietta Ellison ; Hester Sophia, mar-  ried Dr. Robert S. Bullus; Catherine Mar-  garetta, died young: Edmund, of whom fur-  ther: W^ashington Quincy, remained unmar-  ried : Hamilton, also remained unmarried ;  and Henry Jackson, married Helen Mac-  Farlane.   (W) Edmund, fourth son of Jacob and  Catherine (Ludlow) Morton, was born in  New York City, June i, 1800, died in .Au-     gust, 1881, at New Windsor, Orange coun-  ty. New York. Edmund Morton was sent  to West Point, but did not remain there very  long. Afterwards he entered the Phoenix  Bank in New York as cashier, and when he  was thirty years old married and settled in  New Windsor, Orange county. New York,  living with his brother in Knox's headquar-  ters at Vail's Gate. He lived there six years  and then purchased a house built by Dr.  Edward Bullus, of New York, on land in-  herited by his wife, Eliza Ellison, from her  father, who owned large tracts of land in  Orange county and the adjacent counties.  Here he lived the simple life of a country  gentleman. He was very fond of sailing,  and with the assistance of a ship carpenter  built a small yacht, in which he spent many  hours sailing about the Hudson river. He  spent a great deal of time in farming on the  estate of ninety-six acres, which he bought  in 1837. While he was in the Phoenix Bank  he was made aide to Lafayette, when the  famous general was here on his second visit,  on which occasion Lafayette was enter-  tained by Jacob Morton, the father of Ed-  mund, to whom the general presented a  handsome sword still preserved in the Mor-  ton family. Edmund was for years a war-  den and vestryman of St. Thomas' Episco-  pal Church of New Windsor, Orange coun-  tv. New York.   He married, in 1830, Caroline Matilda,  daughter of Thomas Ellison, of New York.  Children: Margaret, married Aymar Van  Buren : Emily L. : Charlotte .Anne, living at  New Windsor, Orange county. New York:  and Edmund Ouincv.     The origin of this surname  TLTKER is somewhat uncertain, but   it is supposed to be one of  those names derived from a trade, that of  'fuller' or 'tucker.' The family is ancient  in England and has arms on record for  1070 and To8o. Motto: Nil drspcranditin.  George Tucker, of Milton-next-Gravcsend,  England, was a man of note in that ancient  place. Queen Elizabeth conveyed the man-  or to him in 1572. Of the twelve principal  iidiabitants of Gravesend and Milton in  I '2, George Tucker is mentioned as the  third. Hcnrv Tucker was mayor of Graves-  end and Milton in 1637. Soon after this     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     31     the Tucker family disappeared and no  further trace of it is found in the records  of Gravesend and Milton, confirming the  generally accepted tradition that about this  time the younger members of the family  emigrated to America.   (I) Henry Tucker, a member of the So-  ciety of Friends, came from England, about  1627, probably from Kent, and settled in  the vicinity of Dartmouth, Massachusetts,  where he died April 2, 1694. Because of  the fact that the Puritan authorities in New  England misjudged and ignored largely  the Quakers among them, it has been diffi-  cult to find records concerning this family,  and but for the private records preserved  by descendants probably this line could  never have been traced. Henry Tucker  was married in January, 1653, to Martha,  whose surname is unrecorded. She died  November g, 1697. Children: Abraham,  born 1654; John, of whom further; Martha,  July 14, 1659; Hannah, July 25, 1662; James,  March 16, 1665 ; Margaret, August 16, 1668.  (H) John, second son . of Henry and  Martha Tucker, was born August 28, 1656,  in Massachusetts. He resided in Connecti-  cut, probably in New London county,  where he was a farmer. He married, in  i6go, Ruth, surname tinknown. Children:  James, of whom further : John, born Octo-  ber 2^. 1693; Joseph, November 7, 1696.   (HI) James, eldest son of John and Ruth  Tucker, was born August 27, 1691, in New  London, or Norwich, died November 29,  1776, in Deal, Monmouth county. New Jer-  sey. About 1718 he settled at Deal, being  one of the first settlers of the town, where  he purchased two hundred acres of land.  The next year he built a house which is  still standing and must have been a grand  mansion in its day. It is two and a half  stories in height, and entirely covered with  shingles. He married, October 3, 1717,  Leah, surname unknown, who died April  18, 1767, at Deal, at the age of seventy-  three vears. Children: John, born July 26,  1718: Ruth. April 16, 1722; Elizabeth, July  2q, 1726; James, October 30, 1727; Hannah,  March 9, 1731 ; Samuel, mentioned below.   (lY) Samuel, youngest child of James  and Leah Tucker, was born October 8. 1735,  in Deal, and inherited the family home-  stead, where he died November 2, 1818. Tn     his last years he was a great sufiferer from  asthma. During the revolution he sufYered  great losses from the depredations of  Tories and other irresponsible marauders,  who infested that section of New Jersey.  As a Quaker he refused to bear arms in  defense of his home, but cheerfully paid the  large taxes necessary in supporting the col-  onial acts. He was a man of medium sta-  ture, robust body, very hospitable and high-  ly esteemed. He married, March 22, 1761,  Elizabeth, born about 1744, died at Deal,  March 3, 1819, daughter of Brittain and  Dinah White, of Shrewsbury, New Jersey.  Children: James, born December 16, 1761 ;  Brittain, October 30, 1763; John, of whom  further; Elizabeth, March 22, 1767; Han-  nah, died young; Samuel, died young;  Phebe, March 13, 1773; Deborah, January  25, 1775; Samuel, January 2, 1776; Hannah.  Mav 6, 1777; Ebenezer Allen, May 5, 1783.   (V) John (2), third son of Samuel and  Elizabeth (White) Tucker, was born Au-  gust 16, 1765, at Deal. He was reared on  the paternal farm. Mtich of his life was  spent on the sea, and he resided at Eaton-  town, New Jersey, until 1797. when he re-  moved to Brooklyn. New York. Two years  later he returned to New Jersey, taking up  his residence at Long Branch. About 1805  he settled on a farm of some two hundred  acres on Shark river, where he died in No-  vember, 1821, of palsy. He married, in  1785, Ann. daughter of Samuel and Rachel  Talman, of Eatontown, who died July 5,  T826, at the age of fifty-seven years.

(Vl) Joseph, second son of John (2)  and Ann CTalman) Tucker, was born April  26, 1788. in Eatontown, New Jersey. He  remained with his parents until seventeen  vears old. In 1805 he went to New York  Citv. where he became a master mason and  builder, and was an active and well known  citizen of the eighth ward which he repre-  sented in the board of aldermen in 1831-32.  and again in 1834-35. In 1842 he was a  member of the state assembly.

He  married (second), January 17, 1833, Isa-  bella, born May 14, 1805, daughter of John  and Isabella Wiley. The only child of the  first wife was Ann Maria. Those of the  second wife were: Isabella, born July 15,  1836; Joseph, September 17, 1838; Winfield,  August 6, 1841 ; Adeline, September 28,   1844.   (VII) Ann Maria, eldest daughter of  Joseph Tucker and only child of his first  wife, Mary (Bogert) Tucker, was born  February 16, 1817, in New York, and mar-  ried, November 15. 1836. George Washing-  ton Tucker, whose ancestry is traced be-  low.   (T) The first of this line of Tucker of  whom definite knowledge can now be ob-  tained was Charles Tucker, an early set-  tler of Elizabethtown, New Jersey, locating  there about 1665. He was one of the orig-  inal associates, or proprietors, of that town,  and is shown by the records to have been  possessed of considerable property. He is  supposed to have been a brother of John  Tooker, who resided in Southold, Long  Island, as early as 1655. having come there  from Boston. Charles Tucker had a house  lot of eight acres, and twenty-one acres of  Meadow on Thompson's creek, adjoining  the Great Island at Elizabethtown. He  also had eighty-six acres of upland and  sixty-nine acres on Two Mile brook. He  also hpd eighty-six acres on Peach Garden  hill. He was among the signers of the  'Oath of A Leagance and Fidelity, taken  by the inhabitants of Elizabeth Town and  the Jurisdiction thereof beginning the iqth  February, 1665.' He again appears as sub-  scriliing to the nath of allegiance, Septem-  ber Ti, if)73. This may have been the date  of his original signature as it appears that  the list was bccun in i66s and nothing  shows the time of its completion. As he was  a Quaker the same difficulty is found in  tracing his family. The records show the  presence of Charles and Warren Tucker,  who were no doubt his sons, in Elizabeth-  town.   (II) Charles (2), son of Charles (i)  Tucker, appears in i(i04 as subscribing one     shilling for the support of a Presbyterian  minister. In 1697 he sold a negro boy  Toney to the pastor. Rev. John Harriman.  No record of his wife or children appears.  He resided in the west field of Elizabeth-  town, which subsequently became the town  of Westfield, and it is probable that the next  mentioned was his son, as family tradition  states that the latter came from the Middle-  sex county family.   (III) James Tucker, born about 1700, set-  tled in New York City, where he first ap-  pears of record on the occasion of his mar-  riage, July 31, 1728, in the First Dutch  Church of New York, to Mary Elizabeth,  daughter of Cornelius and Jenneke (Paers)  Woertendyke. Cornelius Woertendyke was  a son of Jacob Woertendyke from the bow-  cry (country), as shown by the records of  the Dutch Church, and married, March 13,  1709. Jenneke Paers from New York.  James Tucker resided on a part of the  Woertendyke estate near the present Eliz-  abeth street named in honor of his wife.  They had sons: James, Thomas and Rob-  ert. The first died unmarried, and no rec-  ord is found of the second.   (IV) Robert, son of James Tucker, grad-  uated at King's College (now Columbia)  in 1769, and became a physician. He re-  sided near the Bowery in the vicinity of  Spring street which led to a spring on  his estate. Mulberry street also received  its name from the mulberries which he cul-  tivated. He was very active in ministering  to .\merican prisoners held by the English  in the notorious sugar house prison in New  York City. Soon after the revolution he  removed to New Jersey, where he married,  and died, leaving a good estate.   (V) Henry, son of Robert Tucker, re-  sided in Orange county. New York, where  he was a farmer. He was a friend of Aaron  Burr, and served as a member of the New  York legislature. He returned to New Jer-  sev where he died. His wife, whose name  is not preserved, was a native of that state.  Thev had sons, Gideon and John. The lat-  ter died unmarried.   (VI) Gideon, son of Henry Tucker, was  born March 23. 1773. died April 23, 1845,  in New York City, where he was a prom-  inent business man.

For a few years in  early life he was engaged in the hardware  husiness in New York, but the care of a  large estate soon took him away from other  'business. He was for some time a member  of the volunteer fire department. He was  a Democrat in political principle until the  issues which brought on the civil war alien-  ated him from this party and he was hence-  forward a steadfast Republican. He mar-  ried. November 15. 1836. in New York, Ann  Maria, daughter of Joseph and Mary CBo-  gert) Tucker, as previously noted. Chil-  dren: T.

He there grew up and  received his education in private schools.  He was early employed in the management  of the Tucker estate in New York and re-  sided in that city until 1882, when he re-  moved to Upper Nyack, New York, where  he built a handsome house and has ever  since maintained his residence there. He is  an Episcopalian, and in politics supports  Republican principles.

They were civilizers and  patriots, and their name appears in the mus-  ter rolls of French, Indian and revolution-  ary wars. The various town records show  conclusively that citizenship and duty have  always been synonymous terms with this  family, and that they have borne their part  each in their generation in the public af-  fairs of the community in which they lived.  The long list of clergymen, the graduates of  Harvard and Yale Colleges, and other insti-  tutions of learning, are evidences of their  .scholarly attainments, and the muster rolls  of the army and navy from the earliest set-  tlement of the country to the present time  prove their patriotism to have been of the  order that counted not the cost when their  country's flag was assailed.   (I) Rev. William Worcester, with bis  wife Sarah and four children, Samuel, Wil-  liam, Sarah and Susannah, came from Eng-  land betw^ecn 1638 and 1640, and became the  settled pastor of the church first gathered  in Salisbury, Massachusetts. No produc-  tion of his pen has been transmitted to pos-  terity to indicate the character and extent  of his intellectual attainments, but Cotton  Mather in the Magnalia enrolls bis name in  the list of the 'Reverend, learned and holy  divines, arriving such from Europe to  America, by whose evangelical ministry the  church in America have been illuminated.'  -Sarah, wife of the Rev. William Worcester,  died at Salisbur3% April 23, 1650. He mar-  ried (second) Mrs. Rebecca Hall, by whom  he had six children. His children were:  Samuel, born in England; William, born in  England; Sarah, born in England; Susan-  nah, liorn in England ; Sarah, born in Salis-  bury, Massachusetts, died young; Timothy,  born in Salisbury; Moses, born in Salis-  bury; Sarah, born in Salisbury; Elizabeth,  born in Salisbury, died j'oung; Elizabeth,  born in Salisbury.   (H) Samuel, eldest son of the Rev. Wil-  liam and Sarah Worcester, was born in  England. He accompanied his father in his  journey to .'\merica, .settling with him at  Salisbury, Massachusetts, where he was  operating a saw mill as earl)' as T65R. At  the first recorded meeting of the Merrimack     people he was chosen overseer, and he was  the first representative of Bradford to the  general court, taking his seat January 16,  1679-80. He was re-elected the ensuing  3'ear, but died while on his way to Boston  to resume his seat. He married Elizabeth  Parrott. Children: William, mentioned be-  low ; Samuel, Francis, Joseph, Timothy,  Moses, Elizabeth, Dorothy, John, Ebenezer,  Susannah.   (HI) William (2), eldest son of Samuel  and Elizabeth (Parrott) Worcester, was  born in Salisbury, Massachusetts, July 21,  1661, died at Bradford, Massachusetts, April  23, 1706.

(\^III) Edwin Dean, second son of El-  dad (3) and Sarah (Chickering) Worcester,  was born in Albany, New York, November  19, 1828, died in New York. June 13, 1904.  During his early schooldays lie spent much  time in his father's law office, assisting in  various technical duties, and thus acquiring  a general knowledge of legal principles and  forms. He completed his studies under  private instruction, and then engaged in  clerical work in the office at Albany of one  of his uncles. He was a student in the of-  fice of Rufus W. Peckham, studying law,  but he again turned to business. After two  years in a machine shop he was placed in  charge of the mechanical department of the  Ransom Stove Works in Albany in 1848.  He continued there until 1852 when he en-  tered the office of the comptroller of the  state of New York, his brother-in-law, John  C. Wright, having been elected to that po-  sition. Afterwards he was employed with  the Albany City Bank and the Commercial  Bank of Albany. The consolidation of sev-  eral of the great railways into one system,  under the name of the New York Central  Railroad Company, afforded him an oppor-  tunity for devising a complete system for  the accounting departments of the new or-  ganization so that ultimately he was made  treasurer of the new company and with  such men as Erastus Corning and Henry  Keep directed its afifairs until the fiirthcr  reorganization of Commodore Vanderhilt  came into effect. He went abroad in 1869  for rest and after his return a plan for the     36     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     underground railway in New York was in-  augurated by Commodore Vanderbilt and  he was placed in charge of it until it was  abandoned. In 1873 he was made chairman  and treasurer of the Lake Shore and Michi-  gan Southern Railway Company, which un-  der his supervision was partially organized  in its financial arrangements. Mr. Worces-  ter was a principal representative of the  various interests with which he was con-  nected before the Windom committee of the  United States senate, which inquired into  the various railroad systems of the country.  He negotiated a considerable part of the  bonds of the forty million dollar mortgage  of the New York Central & Hudson River  Railroad Company in 1873. Two years later  he was elected director of the Western  Union Telegraph Company. For many  years the friend and confidant of Commo-  dore Vanderbilt Mr. Worcester was pres-  ent at his death and was a witness to his  will. He was appointed secretary of the  Michigan Central upon its incorporation  with the New York Central system in 1878,  and in 1883 became vice-president of the  Lake Shore and Michigan Southern com-  panies. In December, 1903, he completed  his fiftieth year of continuous service in the  great svstem of railroads which develoj^ed  out of ihe original New York Central, and  lived to the following year. His remains  were interred in the Albany Rural cemetery.   He married, April 30. 1855. in Albany,  New York, Mary Abigail, daughter of War-  ren S. Low, of that city ('see Low VIII).  His children were: i. Edwin Dean, men-  tioned below. 2. George Henry, born June  6. 1857; married, October 17, 1888. Lydia  Dearborn Kimball, who died June 16, IQ05.  3.

(IX) Edwin Dean (2). eldest son of Ed-  win Dean Ci) and Marv .A.bigail CLow)  Worcester, was born in Albany, New York,     February 25, 1856. He received his early  education at the Albany Boys' School,  where he was graduated in 1871. During  the next year he entered Yale College and  from that institution he was graduated in  the well known class of 1876. He was win-  ner of the Junior Exhibition Prize and of  the De Forest medal, and at graduation  ranked second with the honors of salutaio-  rian, his chum, Arthur T. Hadley (who in  1899 became president of Yale University)  having the first place and the valedictor\'.  He then took the course of the Yale Law  School, where in 1878 he received the de-  gree of Bachelor of Law. In the same year  he returned to his early home in Albany, and  passed a clerkship in the office of Hand &  Hale and was admitted to the bar. In  1882 he left Albany and spent a year and a  half in foreign travel. Establishing himself  in New York City he formed with Thorn-  dike Saunders and G. Creighton Webb in  May. 1884, the legal copartnership of Saun-  ders, Webb & Worcester, which continued  until May i, 1907. He then became a mem-  ber of the law firm of Worcester. Williams  & Lehman (also of New York City), with  Stephen G. Williams and Irving Lehman.  Mr. Lehman was elected a justice of the  New York supreme court in 1908. whereby  the law firm was dissolved. Mr. Worcester  is at present (1912) the senior partner in  the firm of Worcester, \\'illiams & Saxe. 30  Broad street, New York, his partners being  Stephen G. Williams, John G. Saxe and  Rogers H. Bacon. Mr. Worcester is a mem-  ber of the Century, University and Yale  clubs of New York City, and also of the  association of the bar, in which organization  he has held several official positions.   (The Low Line.) I   This name seems to have come to Amer-  ica from England and is also found among  the Dutch immigrants at New Amsterdam.  The family herein traced was very early  located in Massachusetts, whence it has  been distributed over a wide area and has  contributed much to the general develop-  ment and prosperity of the nation.   (I) Thomas Low, of Chebacco Parish,  Ipswich, now Essex, Massachusetts, was  born in England, and is believed to have  been a son of Captain John Low, master of     II     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     i7     the ship 'Ambrose', and vice-admiral of the  fleet that brought over Governor Wln-  throp's colony in 1630. The cane and Bible  which are said to have been the property of  Captain John have been handed down in the  families of the Essex Lows and are still  owned by one of them. The Bible was  'Imprinted at London by Christopher Bar-  ker, Printer to the Queenes most excellent  Majestie, dwelling in Pater Noster Rowe at  the signe of the Tegreshead Anno 1579'.  Thomas Low was in Ipswich as early as  1641, and according to his own deposition  was born in 1605. He was a maltster, and  died September 8, 1677. His wife Susannah  died in Charlestown, August 19, 1684, aged  about eighty-six years. Their children:  Margaret, born in England, married, April  8, 1657, General Davidson ; Thomas, born  1632; Sarah, 1637, married Joseph Stafford;  John, mentioned below.   (II) John, second son of Thomas and Su-  sannah Low, was undoubtedly born in Ip-  swich, Massachusetts, died there about  1695, leaving an estate valued at one hun-  dred and sixty-five pounds. He was a malt-  ster, succeeding to the business of his fa-  ther which he continued until about the  time of his death. He married, December  10, 1661, Sarah, daughter of John and Eliza-  beth Thorndike, of Beverly. Children :  John, mentioned below; Elizabeth, born Oc-  tober 18, 1667: Margaret, January 26, 1669;  Dorcas, November 3, 1673; Elias, baptized  September i, 1676; Nathaniel, March 14,  1678; Martha, born September, 1670: Jos-  eph, April 18, 1681 ; Hannah, July 13, i68s.   flTI) John (2), eldest 'child of John (i)  and Sarah (Thorndike) Low, was born  April 24, 166s, in Ipswich, Massachusetts,  and baptized July i, 1670. No record of his  marriage appears. His wife bore the name  of Dorcas and they had children in Che-  bacco : John, mentioned below; Thomas,  born March 5, 1602; Hannah, February i,  1694; Nathaniel, baptized November 15,  1696.   (IV) John (3), eldest child of John (2)  and Dorcas Low. was born February 22,  1601, in Chebacco. Massachusetts. He mar-  ried Anna Annable, intentions recorded  April 18, 1713. They had children recorded  in Ipswich: John, born May 20, 1714; Liicv,  June 15, 1716; Anna, March 5, 1718: Ste-     phen, baptized May 29, 1720; Francis, men-  tioned below ; Jacob, baptized February,  1725; Ephraim, May 19, 1728; Thomas, Jan-  uary II, 1730; Nathaniel, March 5, 1732;  Martha, April 21, 1734, at the Hamlet Par-  ish Church.   (V) Francis, third son of John (3) and  Anna (Annable) Low, was baptized March  18, 1722. at the Hamlet Parish Church in  Ipswich, Massachusetts, died at Barre,  Massachusetts, in 1760. His death was the  result of a fall from a haymow. Tradition  says that he owned the last slaves held in  Massachusetts, but this is manifestly im-  possible because slaves were held in that  state after 1760. He married (first) about  1751. Anna Rice, who died without issue;  married (second) December 4, 1755, Mary,  born March 27, 1735. in Weston, Massachu-  setts, daughter of Nathaniel and Abigail  Jenison.

Fred A. ; iv. Lulu Randall.     This name is said to be from the  BOND Anglo-Saxon word, bonda,   meaning a householder, proprie-  tor or husbandman. The word is latin-  ized 'paterfamilias,' according to one au-  thoritv, 'and rightly enough as it would seem,  because much in the same sense in compo-  sition we use husbandman or husband or  husbond.' The name Le Bond occurs in  the Hundred Rolls. There are several per-  sons called Bonde in the Domesday Book  of England, one of whom is somewhat con-  tradictorily called 'liber homo.' On refer-  ence to Domesday Book it will be found  that numerous estates were held in England  by families of the name of Bond in the time  of Edward the Confessor and through later  years down to the formation of the survey  by William the Conqueror. They held es-  tates in the counties of Cornwall, Dorset,  Essex. Kent. Hants, Berks. Bradford. .Suf-  folk, Gloucester, Northampton and York,  and in several counties held two or more  estates. Whether these were held by a few  wealthy families or by as many families as  there were estates has not been clearlv ascer-  tained, but it is probable that the families  were numerous. The most distinguished  family of the name in England for the last  three or four centuries trace their lineage  to Earth and Holewood in the county of  Cornwall ; some of the old writers of herald-  ry speak of stirps antiquissima Bondorum  of that county.   There is a tradition — a very common sort     of tradition — that three brothers of the  name of Bond came to this country about  the middle of the seventeenth century. One  of them Thomas, said to have been a phy-  sician, settled in Virginia or Maryland. An-  other of the three, John, settled in Newbury,  Massachusetts, and was proprietor in 1662,  having descendants in New England, New  York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan.  The other, William, said to have been a  merchant, settled in Watertown, Massachu-  setts, and from him are descended most of  the family of the name of Bond in New  England. The results of the researches of  H. G. Somerly in England have tended to  discredit part of this tradition.   (T) Jonas Bond, of Bury Saint Edmunds,  county Suffolk, England, married a woman  whose christian name was Rose, and whose  surname was perhaps Wood. He probably  moved to Bury Saint Edmunds, after the  birth of his second child from Hawley or  W^oolpit, where he owned some houses, ac-  cording to the evidence of his will. He died  in August, 1601, and was buried August 5,  1601. Children: Oliver, the 'eldest son';  John, 'the elder'; John, 'the younger',  baptized December 26, 1591 ; Bartholomew;  \\'illiam, baptized December 28, 1595;  Thomas, mentioned below; Elizabeth, bap-  tized March 12, 1599; Margaret, baptized  December 10, 1600.   (H) Thomas, son of Jonas and Rose  Bond, was baptized September 8, 1597. In  his will his father left him the house at  A\'oolpit. He was by occupation a maltster  and his place of residence and also of busi-  ness was Bury Saint Edmunds. His will  was dated November 5, 1658, and proved  March 10. i^'59. at the prerogative court of  Canterbury in London. He married a wo-  man whose baptismal name was Elizabeth,  but whose maiden surname remains un-  known. Children: Thomas, born Septem-  ber 22, 1622; John, February 5, 1624; Wil-  liam, mentioned below; Henry, April 5,  1628; Elizabeth, March 12, 1630; Francis,  May 31, 1632; Marv, January 31, 1636;  Jonas. August 5, 1638.   (Ill) William, son of Thomas and Eliza-  beth Bond, and the immigrant ancestor of  the Bond family, was baptized at Bury  .Saint Edmunds.

(XI) Alfred Hindekoper, son of George  (2) and Rebecca Calhoun (Hindekoper)  Bond, was born July 8, i860. He had an  academic education, and is now a manufac-  turer's agent, being connected with the  George W. Wheelwright Paper Company,  and director of the Federal Terra Cotta  Company. He served six years in the  Massachusetts Naval Reserve. Mr. Bond is  very prominent and is a member of the Cal-  umet, Metropolitan, Ward Room, Racquet  and Tennis and Riding clubs. He married,  in 1896, Louise \'an Bcurcn Davis, and has  one daughter, Mary Louise, born 1897.     This family is ancient in  S.'VCKF.TT England and its ancestors   came from Normandy with  William the Conqueror. The names Sack-  ett, Sacket and Sackville would appear to  be of the same family. In England Thomas  Sackville, Earl of Dorset, born 1636, bore  arms, and was a lineal descendant of one  of the band that accompanied William the  Conqueror to England. The American im-  migrants, Simon and John, are without  doubt of the same family but the connection  cannot be lineally traced.   (I) Simon Sackett, immigrant ancestor of  the American family of the Sacketts here  dealt with, came to New England with his     brother John and nephew John in the ship  ■'Lion', which sailed December i, 1630,  from Bristol, England. lie was in com-  pany with Roger Williams, and with Simon  were his wife Isabel and their infant son,  Simon Jr. They landed after an unusually  stormy voyage at Boston, February 5, 163 1.  He settled in Cambridge and his house was  on the north side of what is now Winthrop  street, in the center of the block between  Brighton and Dunster streets. He lived but  a short time after coming to America and  died in October, 1635. November 3. fol-  lowing his widow Isabel was granted leave  to administer the estate. At the same ses-  sion of the court the memorable decree was  entered that banished Roger \\'illiams from  the colony. The Widow Sackett and her  two sons were among the company that  made the hard journey to form the settle-  ment of Hartford, Connecticut. She mar-  ried there (second) William Bloomfield.  Children of Simon and Isabel Sackett:  Simon, born 1630, died July 9, 1659, married  Sarah Bloomfield ; John, mentioned below.  (II) John, son of Simon and Isabel  Sackett, was born in 1632, in Cambridge.  Massachusetts, and is supposed to have  been the first child of European origin to  be born there. He grew up on his mother'-;  land, and in 1653 became a resident nf  Springfield and was granted land of his own  there. Shortly after his marriage he sold  his house and land at Springfield and re-  moved to property he had purchased at  Northampton. He lived there until 1665.  when he again sold out and went to a farm  bought of one Chapin, near Westfield, on  what are now Sackett's Meadows. He was  one of the first settlers of Westfield. As  soon as he arrived there he built a house  and barn, both of which were burned Oc-  tober 27, 1675, by the Indians who at the  same time destroyed a large amount of  other cattle and property and drove off the  cattle that survived. When something like  tranquility and security had been restored  he rebuilt his house and barn and in addi-  tion erected a saw mill by the side of a  creek that ran into the Westfield river. The  building of this mill brought about a law  suit between him and anotlier family of the  name of Dewey, who claimed that by the  erection of this mill the water was backed     SOUTHERX NEW YORK     43     up on their grist mill. The dam was or-  dered removed with the help of the plain-  tiff's hired man and oxen for nine days.  John Sackett seems to have been a man of  considerable character and ability, taking  time from the work of the pioneer to help  to transact the public business of the town  and church. He was a selectman in West-  field in 1672 and at various times after-  wards, as late as 1693.   He married (first) November 23, 1659,  Abigail Hannum, born 1640, died October 9,  1690, daughter of William and Honor  fCapen) Hannum. He married (second)  Sarah, daughter of John Stiles, widow of  John Stewart, who had lived at Springfield.  His will, dated May 10, 1718, was proved  May 20. 1719. He gave all his real estate  away before his death, mostly to his chil-  dren, who numbered nine. His children  were: John, mentioned below; William,  born April 20, 1662, died March 28, 1700,  married Hannah Graves ; Abigail, born De-  cember I, 1663, died July 3, 1683, married  John Noble ; Mary, born 1665, died Novem-  ber 19, 1667; Hannah, born March 7, 1660,  died August 30, 1749. married Benjamin  Newbury; Mary, born June 8, 1672. died  1729, married Benjamin Moseley ; Samuel,  born September 16, 1674, died November 8,  1709, married Elizabeth Bissel; Elizabeth,  born Mav 27, 1677, ^'^d June t6, 1682;  Abigail, born 1683, died September, 1721,  married David King.

(\T) Major Buell Sackett, son of Benja-  min (2) and Deborah (Buell) Sackett, was  born July 28, 1763, died January 18, 1840.  When but sixteen he enlisted in the Fifth  Continental Regiment which at that time  was encamped at New Windsor about two  miles distant from General Washington's  headquarters at Newburg, New York. This  regiment subsequently served on both sides  of the Hudson and was on duty at West  Point when Major Andre was executed. At  the close of the war Major Sackett became  a resident of Lebanon, New York, and  joined the Lebanon company of the Co-  lumbia county regiment of militia, which  was composed mainly of veterans of the  revolutionary army. In this company he     44     SOUTHERN \EW YORK     served first as a private and then passed  through the non-commissioned grades to  ensign, receiving a commission as such in  March, 1803. The following year he was  promoted lieutenant and in 1805 to captain.  In 1807 he retired from the militia service  with the rank of major.

Sackett, of  New York City, the grantor being Ebenezer  Biiell. and the grantee Buell Sackett, Ben-  jamin's son. A newspaper notice of Major  Buell Sackett's death published at the time  closes as follows: 'He was a soldier of the  Revolution and was one of the guard at the  execution of Major Andre. Thus one after  another fall and are deposited beneath the  sods of the valley the few remaining patriots  of early days. Very shortly the death  knell of the last one must sound in the ears  of those who have inherited the rich legacy  left by these patriots.' He married Sally  Earl IBeach.

The name of Bussing dates back to the  early settlement of Manhattan. The family  has been closely identified with the history  and business life of New York, and through-  out all the generations has always borne an  honorable record.   (I) Arent Hermanse Bussing came to this  country after the Thirty Years War, about  1639, from Westphalia, on the borders of  Overyssel, Holland, to Flatbush, Long Is-  land, where he purchased a farm. Ten  years later he moved to Haarlem, New  Vork, where he purchased a large tract of  land, owning at his death, in 1718, one hun-,  dred and twenty-seven acres.   'On the northwest corner of Eighth avenue and  145th street stood until lately one of the few sur-  vivals of the homes of 1674, the old Bussing house  built of stone, with shingled ends and dormer win-  dows. All t!ie inside woodwork was of locust In  the kitchen stood the old-fashioned Dutch oven by  the side of the fifteen-feet-wide fireplace. It was the  house of that good man and righteous citizen, Arent  H. Bussing, and was built on land which came  through his marriage with gentle Susannah de la  Mater. There it stood for over two centuries, just  as It did when .Arent and Susannah set up their sim-  ple housekeeping and when it was surrounded by  ample barns and a multitude of other out-buildings  dominatmg the old Bussing farm of one hundred  and twenty-seven acres, covered then by growing  crops and occupied by lowin'^ herds.'   The records of New Amsterdam show  that Arent H. Bussing, of New Haarlem,'  was named one of the five magistrates or  commissioners in 1673. The court minutes  of New Haarlem give the oath which was  taken by these magistrates, and it is as  follows:   'We Commissioners of New Haarlem promise and  swear in presence of .Mmighty God that we will ad-  minister law and justice, promote the welfare of the  village, uphold pure and true Christian religion con-  formable to the Word of God and order of the  Synod of Dort. We will obey and maintain in the  name of their High Mightinesses the Lords States  General of the United Netheriands and his High-  ness the Prince of Orange. So trulv keep me, God  -AlmightN'.'   In 1676 Mr. Bussing was made corporal  of the nightwatch, organized by order of  the governor-general. He was an officer in  the Reformed Dutch Church of Haar'em.     46     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     He married, in 1673, Susannah, daughter of  Claude and Hester (DuBois) de la Maistre,  or de la Mater, of Flatbush, Long Island.  Their oldest child, Peter, married, in 1700,  Rebecca Vermilye. Their youngest child  was Harman, mentioned below.   (II) Harman, son of Arent Hermanse and  Susannah (de la Maistre or de la Mater)  Bussing, was born in 1677, died in 1762. He  married, in 1707, Sarah, daughter of Isaac  Selover, of New Castle. They were the par-  ents of Abraham, mentioned below.   nil) Abraham, son of Harman and Sarah  (Selover) Bussing, was born in 1724, died  in 1798. Among Revolutionary remi-  niscences is an order issued on July 3, 1777,  by the commandant of New York, 'where-  by the mayor of the city is permitted to cut  wood from the lands of Peter and John \\'a.\-  dron, Abraham Bussing and John Meyer, in  order to supply the city with fuel.' Mr.  Bussing married, in 1749, Elizabeth, daugh-  ter of Peter and Jane (Wessels) Mesier,  and they were the parents of Abraham,  mentioned below.   (IV) Abraham (2), son of Abraham (i)  and Elizabeth (Mesier) Bussing, was born  on Cortlandt street, New York City, in  1770, died in 1829. He was an active mer-  chant at No. 59 Cortlandt street until 1799,  when he moved to No. 151 Broadway,  where he conducted the dry goods business.  Valentine's 'Manual' mentions that 'the  value of the store occupied by Abraham  Bussing in 1815 at 151 Broadway was $13,-  000.' He joined with thirty-six other citi-  zens in raising funds with which to erect the  first public school house in New York City.  It stood at Chatham Square and Tryon  Row, and accommodated five hundred  scholars in the main room, and was dedi-  cated in 1809. In an early history this men-  tion is made of it : 'The gentlemen to whose  benevolence the society was indebted for  contributions of building material and the  superintendence of the construction of the  edifice, are worthy of an honorable place  among the early friends of 'Free Schools  for Poor Children,' as the public schools  were then called.'

During his youth his family moved  from Abingdon Square to Washington  Square, where he was living at the time of  his marriage in 1859. In 1869 he moved  from New York City to Montclair, New  Jersey, where for many years he took an  acti\e part in political, financial and church  afifairs. He was a member of the town com-  mittee, a founder, and until his death a di-  rector of the First National Bank of Mont-  clair. and trustee and elder in the Presby-  terian church. During his residence in  Montclair he continued his business inter-  ests in New York City. He was treasurer  and afterwards president of the Ausable  Horse Nail Company, and he was also a  director of the National Shoe & Leather  Bank. He was a member of the Essex  County Country Club at Orange, the Mont-  clair Club, of various Republican clubs and  of the Young Men's Christian Association.  He returned to New York City in 1894, and  lived at No. 14 East 56th street, until 1902,  when he moved to No. 24 East 61 st street,  which was his home until he died in 1005.  He married, November 9, 1859. Emma,  daughter of Samuel and Mary (Johnson)  Frost. Their only child, Alice Cary, mar-  ried, April 22, 1902, Howard Thayer Kings-  bury, ii.

(V) John Schcrmerhorn, son of .Xbraham  (2) and Hester (Kingsland) Bussing, was  born on Cortlandt street, New York City,      SOZ - Itf.'O'!-     SOUTHERN NEAV YORK     47     October 15, 1802, died June 9, 1864. His  fatiier's two sisters, Elizabeth and Jane  Bussing, married, in 1771 and 1773 respec-  tively, two brothers, Peter and Simon  Schermerhorn, and John was named after  his uncles, Schermerhorn. He began busi-  ness as a wholesale dry goods merchant in  1823, on Maiden Lane, near Pearl street, in  connection with his brother, Edmund Kings-  land, under the firm name of E. & J. Buss-  ing. Their business was afterwards moved  to the northwest corner of William and  John streets, and occupied one of the then  celebrated 'Washington Row' of stores  which they were largely instrumental in  erecting, where they carried on a large trade  with the entire country. The firm remained  unchanged until dissolved in 1849, having  maintained its credit unimpaired through all  the financial convulsions of New York busi-  ness life during a period of twenty-si.x years.  After the death of his brother, Mr. Bussing  became the head of the firm of John S. Buss-  ing & Company, iron and nail merchants,  and occupied the building at No. 32 Clifif  street, where his earlier life had been spent  when that portion of the city was residen-  tial. He resided for nearly twenty years at  No. 4 East I2th street, New York City, in a  house which he had built when that street  was considered far uptown, and there he  died.   Both the brothers, Edmund Kingsland  and John Schermerhorn, held influential po-  sitions in the church and also in secular in-  stitutions. The latter was one of the  original incorporators of the New York Life  Insurance Company and a member of its  board of trustees until his death. He was  also a director in the Niagara Fire Insurance  Company, president of the Northern Dis-  pensary, and treasurer of the Board of Do-  mestic Missions of the Reformed Dutch  Church. While residing for a time in As-  toria he served the Reformed Church of that  place as superintendent of the Sunday  school ; later was made deacon and subse-  quently elder. He was a man full of spiril;  and energv. and was active to the end, at-  tending a business meeting the dav before  his death. It was always a great pleasure  to him to be identified with benevolent and  church work, and he always was ready when  dutv called.     John S. Bussing married (first) in  Brooklyn, June 25, 1S25, Agnes Ann, born  August 5, 1802, died January 14, 1831,  daughter of Robert and Maria (Wood)  Speir, of Brooklyn ; they had three children :  Two died in infancy; the surviving child,  Robert Speir, mentioned below. He mar-  ried (second) in 1833, Ann, daughter of  Abraham and Margaret (Field) Van Nest,  of New York City ; children : Abraham Van  Nest, born in 1834, died in 1839; John Stuy-  vesant, mentioned below ; Mary, residing at  the present time (19 12) in the old home at  No. 4 East I2th street. New York City.   The Van Nest and Field families were  among the first to settle in Somerset county.  New Jersey, where they purchased large  tracts of land, some of which, after two  hundred years, are still in possession of their  descendants. Both families have always  been prominent in church and state affairs,  serving in the colonial and revolutionary  wars as officers and minute-men. In the  church many of them occupied official po-  sitions and some entered the ministry.   George Van Nest, father of Abraham Van  Nest, aforementioned, owned a large farm  near Somerville, New Jersey, and was  known as 'Prince George' because of his  generous hospitality. His son, Abraham  Van Nest, became a prominent New York  merchant and a leader in both church and  city afifairs. For many years he served as  president of the Greenwich Savings Bank.  In 1819 he purchased for his summer resi-  dence the old historic 'Sir Peter Warren  Mansion', in what was then known as  Greenwich village. It then was called 'The  Van Nest Homestead' and remained such  until after the death of Mr. Van Nest in  1864. In this house John Schermerhorn  Bussing and Ann ^^an Nest were married.   (\'I) Robert Speir, son of John Schermer-  horn and Agnes Ann (Speir) Bussing, was  born .September 28, 182''), died June 21, 1895.  He succeeded his father in business, and  afterwards for many years was senior mem-  ber of the firm of Bussing, Crocker &  Dodge, manufacturers in metal ware. Dur-  ing the last forty-five years of his life he  resided in Brnokh-n. where he was prom-  inent in church work, devoting much time  and labor to the interests of the Bethel  Sunday school of Plymouth Church, of     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     which he was superintendent. During his  latter years Mr. Bussing was the beloved  teacher of a large Bible class of young  women at St. Ann's Church on the Heights.  He was vice-president of the Brooklyn City  Dispensary, and during the civil war was a  great advocate of improved sanitary affairs,  making large donations to that end, and  keeping the matter before the public by  persistent agitation. He was also president  of the Young Men's Christian Association  of Brooklyn from 1861 to 1864, and a strong  friend of the temperance cause.   He married, January 8, 1850, Mary Kings-  land, born Ma'rch 12, 1831, died July 19,  1910, daughter of Rodman and Mary  (Kingsland) Brown. Children: i.

(VI) John Stuyvesant, son of John Scher-  merhorn and Ann (Van Nest) Bussing, was  born in New York City, September 21, 1838.  He acquired his early education in Colum-  bia College Grammar School when it was  located in Park Place, in close connection  with the college. For thirty-three years he  was engaged in the banking and brokerage  business on Wall street, under the firm  name of Gelston & Bussing, the partner-  ship being dissolved by the death of the  former. Both partners were members of  the New York .Stock Exchange. This house  was one of the oldest firms with continued  and unchanged membership, and one of the  most conservative in the street. It passed  unscathed through the many exciting ex-  periences of Wall street. It stood unswerv-  ingly for perseverance, energy, honesty, up-  right dealing, strict integrity and close at-  tention to the interests of customers. Mr.     Bussing retired from active business in 1898  and since that time has devoted himself to  various forms of philanthropic and church  work.   Mr. Bussing has always been actively  identified with Christian work, filling many  positions of trust and honor. For thirty-  three years he was one of the consistory  of the Collegiate Reformed Church of New  York, and as an elder served on its finance  committee. 'His calm and clear judgment  in the solution of serious problems gave  him an influential voice in all important de-  cisions. His wise and zealous loyalty to  the Collegiate Church has contributed large-  ly to the conservation of its interests and  influence in the denomination and in the  church at large.' For a long period he was  connected with the Young Men's Christian  Association as one of its board of managers,  and later as one of the advisory board, and  also served in the same capacity on the  board of the Young W^omen's Christian As-  sociation and as chairman of its finance  committee. He was trustee of the Northern  Dispensary from 1875 to 1882, and also  served as president of the New York Bible  Society. He has long been identified with  the Hospital Saturday and Sunday Associa-  tion of New York City, was one of its foun-  ders, and as one of its board of managers  was actively interested in its work. In  1885 he was elected treasurer of the Board  of Domestic Missions of the Reformed  Church of America, and held the position  for twenty-one years, giving the work his  active, vigilant sympathy. He was also  treasurer of the Industrial Educational As-  sociation, treasurer of the Board of Trustees  of the Interdenominational Committee of  the Young Men's Christian Association, and  director in the City Mission and Tract So-  ciety. In i8q9 he became a member of the  committee of the General Synod which had  care of the grounds and property of the  Theological Seminary at New Brunswick,  New Jersey. Through his efforts and lib-  erality great improvements were made in  the furnishing and decoration of Hertzog  Hall and also in beautifying the surround-  ings, making the seminary a fit and attrac-  tive abode for the sons of the prophets. In  ic)04. he was elected a member of the Board  of Superintendents of the same institution.     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     49     Mr. Bussing served for over seven years in  the Twenty-second Regiment, National Guard  of the State of New York. During the civil  war he went to the front with his regiment in  1863, and received his honorable discharge  as first lieutenant of Company A from Gov-  ernor Fenton. He is one of the Sons of the  Revolution, being eligible because of the  service in the revolutionary war of his great-  grandfather, John B. Field, and is also a  member of the Society of Colonial Wars,  and of the St. Nicholas Society, which is  largely composed of old Knickerbockers.   Mr. Bussing married (first) in 1873, Kate,  daughter of James and Maria (Kinney)  Breath. Their twin children, Kate and  Anna, died in infancy. He married (second)  October 31, 1882, Emily Morton, daughter  of Henry T. and Sarah E. (Barstow) Jen-  kins. Mr. Bussing is residing at the present  time (1912) at No. 26 East loth street. New  York City, his home for the past thirty  years.     The surname Eagle would ap-  EAGLE pear to have been originally   applied to a person of an am-  bitious or soaring disposition. There are  several legendary stories of eagles which  may have originated the name, as for ex-  ample that of De Aquila (Lat. eagle), of  which it is said : 'The surname of this fam-  ily was originally assumed from Aquila in  Normandy, so denominated by reason an  eagle had made her nest in an oak growing  there when the castle was first building.' Eu-  genulf de Aquila accompanied Duke Will-  iam into England at the Norman Conquest.  The family were banished by Henry H. and  probably never returned, as their name does  not occur in more recent times, but some  hold that the modern name Eagle or Eagles  in England is a translation of the Latin sur-  name. In Ireland the surnames Eagle and  Eagleton are often translations or adapta-  tions from the Gaelic, O'HioIracain. In a  book called 'The Modern Irish Gentry' the  only mention of the Eagles and Bulls were  in the following couplets. The following is  a brief summary of the family names that  came into Ireland with the Cromwellian  settlement, or with the Revolution :   'The Parrotts, Eagles, Cocks, and Hens,  The Swallows, Snipes, Pyes, Robins, Wrens.'     'Our Bulls and Bears, and Wolves and Hares,  Strong, Steeds and Hunters, Colts and Marcs.'  The coat-of-arms of the Eagle family is as  follows : Sable six lions argent, three, two  and one. Crest: A lion's gamb erect and  erased or grasping an eagle's leg erased at  the thigh gules. See Fairchild's 'Book of  Crests.' Also Burke's '(icneral Armory.' The  coat-of-arms of the Eagles family is as fol-  lows : Or a fesse between three eagles dis-  played azure. Crest: Two lions' jiaws in a  saltire ppr.   (I) Henry Eagle, first American ancestor  of the branch of the Eagle family here dealt  with, was the son of George Eagle, surgeon  in the British army, and was born in the  city of Dublin, Ireland, in the latter part of  the eighteenth century, and died in New  York City in 1852. He catne to this coun-  try about the year 1795 and settled in New  York. He became the major of an Irish  brigade belonging to the troops of New  York, and during the war of 1812 was sta-  tioned at Long Island and assisted in pre-  paring earthworks near Fort Greene. The  family residence was on the southeast cor-  ner of Broome street and Broadway (No.  764 Broadway). At that time that section  of the city was in the country, a mile and  a half distant from the settled portion of  the city. The two brothers of Henry Eagle  were in the British military service ; one  was a surgeon, the other went to the East  Indies, rose to the rank of major, married  a lady of title, and died in 1814.   Henry Eagle married (first) Christiana  Bull, of Waterford, Ireland, who died in  1816. Their children were: John, died un-  married : Eliza Bennis, married Dr. Thomas  Ogden ; Ellen, married Abijah Smith : Chris-  tiana, married Rev. John Messenger; Henry,  of whom further. Henry Eagle married  (second) Eliza Nelson. Their children  were : Robert Nelson, W' illiam. Horatio, Ma-  tilda, Caroline, Maria, died young.   (II) Henry (2), son of Henry (i) and  Christiana (Bull) Eagle, was born in New  York City, April 7, 1801, died there. No-  vember 26, 1882. He entered the United  States navy on New Year's Day. 1818. and  passed about a year on the seventy-four gun  ship 'Independence'', then used as a school-  ship for midshipmen in Boston harbor. It  was the custom of the period for midship-     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     men to go into the merchant service to gain  experience. Midshipman Eagle sailed in the  frigate, 'Macedonian', under command of  Captain Downs, for the Pacific coast of  South America, then passing from the feeble  grasp of Spain. Seven days after leaving  Boston the vessel lost her masts in a se-  vere storm, but succeeded by the aid of jury  masts in reaching Norfolk. Virginia, where  damages were repaired. While at Panama,  an incident occurred illustrating his gener-  ous impulses, not yet fully curbed by con-  ventional rules. A young English surgeon,  named Kernan, belonging to the expedition  of Sir (iregor McGregory, had been cap-  tured with others during the attack on Porto  Belle, and marched across the country to  Panama, where he was placed in the chain  gang and condemned to be a street scaven-  ger. The owner of a drug store ascer-  taining his profession, obtained permission  to employ him. Midshipman Eagle, who  visited the store, learned the facts, and tak-  ing another midshipman into his confidence,  rescued and secreted the prisoner on board  the ship, though fired on six or eight times  while making the attempt. On demand of  the viceroy, Captain Downs made search,  without discovering the surgeon until after  he had put out to sea. One of the most  valued souvenirs in possession of Commo-  dore Eagle's family is a letter written by  Kernan, warmly expressing his gratitude for  deliverance from a captivity which would  doulHless have ended in death. The frigate  returned to Boston in June, 1821.   After being stationed at the Brooklyn  Navy Yard until the latter part of 1822,  Midshipman Eagle took a voyage as sailor  on the .American ship, 'Beaver', to the  East Indies and China, without special inci-  dent, exce])t that he came near being lost  overboard in a heavy squall. His salary on  this cruise was half pay from the government,  $115 per annum. After this voyage he was  for a time on duty in the Navy Yard, and  was then transferred to the man-of-war  brig. 'Enterprise', fitting out for a cruise in  the West Indies after pirates. Five or six  months were passed in this way when the  vessel was totally wrecked on the unin-  habited island, called Little Curacoa. One  of the lieutenants and Midshipman Eagle  were sent to Curacoa to charter and prepare     a \essel for taking home the officers and  crew. This was satisfactorily accomplished,  and on his return he was ordered to the  sloop of war, 'Erie', of the Mediterranean  squadron. The squadron touched at several  of the (irecian islands. Some weeks were  sj^ent at the port of Smyrna, and then the  fleet separated, and the 'Erie' sailed for  Algiers, arriving there just after the British  consul had been falsely accused by the Bey  of appropriating to himself a portion of the  English tribute and had embarked for Malta.  During the year 1S25 the 'Erie' visited the  Bay of Naples.   Alidshipnian Eagle was commissioned  lieutenant, March 3, 1827. and in that and  the following year cruised again in the West  Indies and in the sloop-of-war, 'Natchez',  where on one occasion he commanded the  launch, and with another boat's crew at-  tacked and routed a pirate schooner. Re-  turning he was sent to the Brazils in the  frigate, 'Hudson', the flag-ship of the  squadron, and remained on the station for  some years. Lieutenant Eagle was at-  tached to the receiving shi]) at New York,  and in 1834 sailed again for the Brazilian  station in the sloop, 'Erie', where he passed  a second period of several years. He was  stationed at the rendezvous at New York in  1840, and the following two years cruised  in the Pacific Ocean on the sloop-of-wy,  'Yorktown', when he w^as i)laced in com-  mand of the schooner, 'Shark', and served  two years more on the Pacific station. He  was commissioned commander, June 4,  1844. On his return he was detailed to  superintend the construction of the Stevens  iron battery at Hoboken, to which he de-  voted several years, acting as inspector in  New York in 1846. The Mexican war called  him to the Gulf, where he commanded the  bomb vessel, 'Aetna' and a division of five  vessels of the squadron. Taking Frontera,  the seaport of the fertile province of To-  basco. in southern Mexico, he was appointed  civil and military governor of the jirovince  and collector of the port. The imports were  principally from this country. He per-  formed the duties of his dual ofifice so ac-  ceptably, increasing the revenue, opening  schools, and encouraging people to industry,  that on the restoration of peace they be-  sought him to remain, declaring that he had     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     51     lightened their burdens and elevated their  cnndition. Subsequent to the war he was  on special service. In 1853 he was sent to  the Gulf of St. Lawrence and adjacent  waters, in command of the steamer, ''Prince-  ton', of the home squadron, to protect the  interests of our fishermen. After a year or  more spent in this service, Captain Eagle  was, in November, 1854, ordered to cruise  in the 'Princeton'' in search of the missing  sloop-of-war, 'Albany', commanded by his  old friend. Commander Gerry, who had  sailed from Aspinwall, September 25, 1854.  After a fruitless cruise of two months  through the Caribbean Sea and the West  Indies, all hope was abandoned ; the 'Al-  bany' was never heard from. He was com-  missioned captain, September 14, 1855.   On the first overt act of rebellion in 1861,  he was the bearer of important communi-  cations from the commandant of the Brook-  lyn Navy Yard to Washington. Having ac-  complished his mission, he asked for imme-  diate active service. The only command  then available was that of the gunboat,  'Monticello', which he willingly accepted,  arriving in Hampton Roads within a few  days after the fall of Fort Sumter. During  the remainder of April and the month of  May he blockaded the James and Elizabeth  rivers. On May 19, 1861, he made the first  naval attack of the war and silenced the  guns of the battery at Sewell's Point, one  of the defenses of Norfolk. In connection  with this memorable attack, he subsequent-  • ly received an official letter from Hon.  Gideon \\'elles, then secretary of the navy,  in which was stated : 'The Department can-  not withhold the expression of its high ap-  preciation of your promptitude and gal-  lantry'. The command of the frigate,  'Santee'. was now ready for him, and he  sailed for the Gulf, and passed two years  principally in blockading Pensacola, Florida,  and Galveston, Texas, during which time he  captured several vessels, including the pri-  vateer, 'Royal Yacht'. \\'hile blockading  Galveston, Captain Eagle requested of  Farragut that he be assigned to duty in the  contests on the Mississippi river, to which  Farragut wrote in reply : 'Your turn will  come, I hope soon, for active employment  in rougher work.' This wish to have Eagle  with him in the Mississippi fight was not,     however, to be realized, for the 'Santee'.  although a splendid frigate, was unfit and  unable to do the work of a steamer in run-  ning past forts, etc. It was Captain Eagle's  misfortune that in volunteering so soon for  service, he had to be given a sailing vessel.  He received his commission as commodore,  July 16, 1862, and on January i, 1863, hav-  ing reached the age of sixty-two, was placed  on the retired list, although he was on ac-  tive duty for his country until 1867. He  was prize commissioner in New York in  1864, and a part of 1865, and for a year later  inspector of light houses of the entire Gulf  coast.

A great many families bearing the name  of French claim their descent from Rollo,  Duke of Normandy, who settled in France  and in 910 A. D. formally adopted the Chris-  tian religion, taking at his baptism the name  of Robert, Count of Paris, who was his god-  father. He had already conquered the prov-  ince of Normandy, which was ceded to him  in due form by Charles the Simple of  France, King, who also gave him in mar-  riage his daughter Gi.sela, A. D. 912. Anti-  quarians have brought to light what are  supposed to be about forty variations of the  surname, French, among them being Frene,  Freyn. Frcvne, dc la Freyne. do la Fresnay,  Frainch, Ffrenche, and Frenche. The an-  cient motto of one branch of the family was  'malo mori quam foedari' — 'death rather     than dishonor.' It is said that 'of the sev-  enteen families of French mentioned by  Burke are quite a variety of armorial bear-  ings, the dolphin and the fleur de lis being  the most conspicuous.' From Harlovan,  third son of Rollo, descended Sir Ma.xinii!  ian de French, whose son Sir Theoples  French (or Freyn) went with William the  Conqueror to England and fought in the  battle of Hastings. This was the first  branch of the French family planted in Eng-  land, and from that descent of Rollo are sup-  posed to be many of the families later found  in both England and Ireland.   (I) William French, the immigrant ances-  tor of this family, was born in Halsted.  county Essex, England, March 15, 1603, died  at Billerica, Massachusetts, November 20,  1681. He came to America on the ship 'De-  fence,' with the Rev. Thomas Shepard and  his brother Samuel. Roger Harlakenden and  George and Joseph Cooke, in the summer of  1635. He settled first in Cambridge, and in  1652 was one of the original proprietors and  first settlers of Billerica. He was lieutenant  of the militia and afterwards captain ; was  the first man chosen to sit in the 'deacon's  seat,' 1659; commissioner to establish th'^  county rates in 1659: selectman in 1660. and  for nine years in all ; was on the committee  to examine children and servants in reading,  religion and catechism in 1661 ; was the first  representative or deputy to the general court  at Boston, elected 1660, and taking his seat  in 1663. A tract written by him entitled  'Strength out of A\'eakness.' in which he  gives a detailed account of the testimony of  an Indian convert to Christianity, was pub-  lished in London and afterwards republished  in the 'Massachusetts Historical Societv  Collections.' He bought part of the old  Dudley farm in Billerica, and his house  stood near the turnpike, east of the Brad-  ford road, near Ralph Hill's house. Hill  called him brother in his will. French was  a tailor by trade. He married (first) a wo-  man who.se baptismal name was Elizabeth,  and who is surmised to have been sister to  the Rev. Zachariah Symmes. She died  March 31, 1668. He married (second) Mav  6, 1669, Mary, widow of John Stearns,  daughter of Thomas Lathrop. of Barnstable.  Massachusetts. His widow married, June  29, 1687, Isaac Mixer, of Watertown. His     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     53     estate was divided December 6, 1687, be-  tween tJTe widow and three daughters —  Mary Sharp, and Sarah and Hannah French.

A descendant of Lieutenant William  French, himself named William French, a  resident of Dummerston in the New Hamp-  shire grants, was the celebrated victim of  the Westminster massacre of 1775. As this  was the direct result of the first organized  resistance to British authority in the Ameri-  can colonies, William French has been  claimed as the first martyr to the cause of  American independence. On his gravestone  is this quaint inscription :   'In memory of William French  Son to Mr. Nathaniel Frencli. Who  Was shot at Westminster, March ye 13th, 1775.  By the hands of the cruel Ministerial tools  Of Georg ye 3d, in the Corthouse at 11 o'clock  at night in the 23d year of his Age.'   'Here WILLIAM FRENCH his Body lies  For Murder his Blood for Vengeance Cries  King Georg the third his Tory Crew  That with a Bawl his Head Shot threw  For liberty and his Country's Good  He Lost his Life his dearest blood.

The name Conkling is  CONKLING found in the early records   in a variety of forms  among them Conkline, Conkling, Concklyne,  Conkelyne, and so on. The evidence is that  the early immigrants bearing it came from     56     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     England, so the name may be presumed to  be English, though there is nothing like it in  the ordinary published works dealing with  English surnames. Neither in Anglo-Saxon  nor in Norman French is there any sugges-  tion of the elements that compose the name.  One authority finds the root in Gaelic, which  once the ancient Celtic language of the  whole British Isles, is a key to those who  know it for a host of names of places and  persons both in Britain and the Continent,  apart from the places where it is still under-  stood. This authority suggests that the  name Conkling is derived from Conghailen,  the ancient Celtic form of the Gaelic name.  Connelan, transplanted to England. There  is extant an interesting pedigree of this fam-  ily carrying back to ancient Milesian times.  Whatever the origin of the name it ajipears  that it was first anglicized, and then Ameri-  canized, and that the first bearers of it here  were Annanias and John Conkling or Con-  kelyne, who were in Massachusetts a little  before the middle of the seventeenth cen-  tury. The evidence is that they came from  Nottinghamshire, England, where both ap-  pear to have been born.   (I) Annanias Conkling, or Conkelyne, the  immigrant ancestor of the Conkling family,  and his brother John are noticed in Sav-  age's 'Genealogical Dictionary.' Annanias  was made a freeman at Salem, May 18, 1642.  He removed in 1650 to East Hampton, and  his brother John to Southold, Long Island.  On an old gravestone there has been found  the inscription : 'Here lyeth the body of  Captain John Conkelyne, born in Notting-  liamshire, England, and died at Southold,  Long Island, April 6, 1694, aged sixty four  years.' Annanias died November, 1657. He  had children baptized: Lewis, April 30,  1643; Jacob, May 18, 1640; Elizabeth, May  18, 164Q. There were children mentioned at  East Hampton: Jeremiah, mentioned be-  low; Cornelius; Benjamin; Hester, married  George Miller; she was six and a half years  I'ld when her father, Annanias, died.   fll> Jeremiah Conkling, son of Annanias  Conkling. or Conkelyne, was born in 1634,  died Alarch 14, 1712. He was an admini-  strator, November 27, 1657, and afterwards  bis brother-in-law, George Miller, was ap-  pointed administrator. He married, in 1658,  Mary, born August 30, 163S, died June 15,     1727, daughter of Lion and Mary Gardiner,  who sailed June 10, 1635, from Holland to  England, then to New England, settling fin-  ally at Saybrook. Children: Jeremiah, mar-  ried Jane Parsons; Cornelius; David; Lew-  is, mentioned below; Annanias; Mary, mar-  ried Thomas Mulford.   (III) Lewis, fourth son of Jeremiah and  Mary (Gardiner) Conkling, was born about  1670. There is very little in the records con-  cerning him, though he married and was  long the head of a large family. His chil-  dren were: Elizabeth, baptized April 21,  1700; Lewis, baptized January 18, 1701, mar-  ried, October 22, 1724, Elizabeth Mulford;  Esther, September 3, 1704; Mary, April 11,  1708; Mercy, May 7, 1710; Isaac, January  25. 1713: Zerviah, January 8, 1716; Cineus,  mentioned below; Abigail, April 16, 1721,  married, October 5, 1740, Nathaniel Baker,   (IV) Cineus, son of Lewis Conkling, was  born in October, 1718, baptized October 19,  1718. He married and had several children,  among them Isaac, and Benjamin, men-  tioned below.   (V) Benjamin, son of Cineus Conkling,  was born about 1746. He married Esther  Hand. Children: Cineus; Alfred, men-  tioned below ; Nathaniel ; Betsey ; Phebe.   (Vi) Alfred, son of Benjamin and Esther  (Hand) Conkling, was born at .-Vmagansett,  Suffolk county. New York, October 12. 1789,  died February 5. 1874, at Utica, New Y'ork.  He was a prominent jurist. He graduated  at Union College in 1810, studied law, and  was admitted to the bar in 1812. He was  district attorney for Montgomery county for  a period of three years, and was elected to  congress as an anti-Jackson Democrat, serv-  ing from 1821 until 1823. He then removed  to Albany and in the year 1825 was appoint-  ed by President John Quincy Adams judge  of the United States district court for the  northern district of New \''ork, which office  he held until 1S52, when President Fillmore  appointed him minister to Mexico. On his  return from that mission in 1853 he settled  at Geneseo, New York, devoting himself  mainly to literary pursuits. Union Col-  lege gave him the degree of LL.D. in 1847.  He published several substantial works that  had a considerable clientele and were effec-  tive in moulding opinion in legal circles,  among them, a 'Treatise on the Organiza-     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     57     tion and Jurisdiction of the Supreme, Cir-  cuit, and District Courts of the United  States,' and 'Admiralty Jurisdiction,' 'The  Powers of the Executive Department of the  United States,' and the 'Young Citizen's  Manual.' He married Elizabeth Cockburn.  Children: i. IMargaret Cockburn, born Oc-  tober 29, 1814. died 1894: married a Mr.  Steele. Mrs. Steele published 'Memoirs of  the Mother and Wife of Washington,' 'Isa-  l;)ell, or Trials of the Heart,' as well as a  translation of Florian's 'History of the  Moors in Spain,' all works having a good  sale, contributing also to current literature.  2. Frederick Augustus, mentioned below. 3.  Roscoe, the United States senator, born in  Albany, New York, October 30, 1829, died  at New York, April 18, 1888. He received  an academic education and studied law un-  der his father. In 1846 he entered the law  office of Francis Kernan. afterwards his col-  league in the senate, and in 1850 became dis-  trict attorney for Oneida county. He was  admitted to the bar in that year and soon  became prominent both in law and in poli-  tics. He was elected mayor of Utica in   1858, and at the expiration of his first term  a tie vote between the two candidates for  the office caused him to hold over for an-  other term. In November, 1858, he was  chosen as a Republican to congress, and  took his seat in that body at the be-  ginning of its first session in December,   1859, a session noted for its long and bitter  contest over the speakership. He was re-  elected in i860, but in 1862 was defeated by  Mr. Kernan over whom, however, he was  elected in 1864. His first committee was  that on the District of Columbia, of which  he was afterwards chairman. He was also  a member of the committee of ways a.nd  means and of the special reconstruction com-  mittee of fifteen. Mr. Conkling's first im-  portant speech was in support of the four-  teenth amendment to the constitution. He  zealously attacked the generalship of Mc-  Clellan, opposed Spaulding's legal tender  act, and firmly upheld the government in  the prosecution of the war. He was re-  elected in the autumn of 1866, but in June,  1867, before he took his seat, was chosen  United States senator to succeed Ira Harris,  and was re-elected in 1873 and 1870. In the  senate he was fmm the first a member of the     judiciary committee, and was connected  with nearly all the leading committees.  Senator Conkling was a vigorous supporter  of President Grant's administration and  largely directed its general policy toward  the south, advocating it in the government  and by his personal influence. He was also  instrumental in the passage of the civil  rights bill, and favored the resumption of  specie payments. As presidential candidate  he received ninety-three votes in the Cin-  cinnati convention in 1876.   (VII) Frederick Augustus, .son of Alfred  and Elizabeth (Cockburn) Conkling, was  born in Canajoharie, New York, August 22,  1816. He received a classical education, and  as soon as he left college entered commercial  life and in course of time became a mer-  chant. He took considerable interest in pol-  itics, and was for a period of about three  years a member of the New York legisla-  ture. When the civil war broke out he or-  ganized at his own expense in June, 1861,  the Eighty-fourth Regiment of New York,  serving as its colonel. During July, 1863,  the regiment did duty as provost guard at  Baltimore, Maryland, and in 1864 it saw  several months' service in Virginia. Colonel  Conkling served one term in congress, from  1861 to 1863, and in the year 1868 was the  Republican candidate for mayor of New  York City. He was a trustee of the College  of Physicians and Surgeons, a member of  the geographical and historical societies, and  author of various reports to the New York  legislature. He also wrote numerous politi-  cal, commercial and scientific pamphlets.  He married Eleonora Ronalds. Son, How-  ard, mentioned below.   (\^III) Howard, son of Frederick Augus-  tus and Eleonora (Ronalds) Conkling, was  born in New York City in 1856. He re-  ceived the first part of his education in pri-  vate academies, and then went through the  New York Universitv Law School, attain-  ing the degree of LL.B. in 1890. He en-  gaged for a time in commercial pursuits,  but after a few years abandoned them to  study law. He was admitted to the bar. and  later removed to Indiana and was admitted  to the bar in Indianapolis, but soon returned  to New York. Sir. Conkling has travelled  extensivelv in European countries and in  Mexico. He is the author of a number of     58     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     works, among them 'The Game Laws',  'Travels in Mexico', a short biography of  'The Chevalier de La Luzerne.' He is a  Presbyterian in religion, and a Republican  in politics. He was a member of the New  York assembly in 1892, 1893 and 1903, and  was formerly president of the Madison  Square Republican Club, and president of  the Hamilton Republican Club. He was a  candidate for congress in 1898, but was de-  feated by George B. McClellan. Mr. Conk-  ling is a well-known linguist, and is greatly  interested in the propagation of the French  language. He is opposed to the method of  teaching languages according to the old sys-  tem, where the grammar and rules are the  main tools of the teacher, and is in favor of  the new methods by which languages are  acquired as a child learns its mother tongue,  that is by the oral method, using first the  ear and later the eye. Mr. Conkling is vice-  president of the Alliance Francaise, and is  the official presenter of medals for the Al-  liance. His favorite recreations include  driving and pedestrianism. He belongs to  the Union, Metropolitan, New York Ath-  letic and Republican clubs, and the Saint  . Nicholas Society. His summer residence is  at T.uxcrne. New York.     The Arkells of Canajoharie,   ARKELL New York, are descendants   of an ancient English family   of frequent and honorable mention in the   history of the British Empire.   (I) The American ancestor was William  Arkell, who came to the United States about  the year 1840. He settled on a farm in  Canajoharie, Montgomery county, New  York, after first going west. TTe was not  pleased with western surroundings, saying  on his return east that he would not live in  a country where the men did not blacken  their hoots. He was a man of education and  true to the traditions of an aristocratic fam-  ilv. He married Mary Carter in England  and had issue.   (]l) James, son of William and Mary Ar-  kell, was born in Oxford, England. Among  his remote ancestors were Sir Hugh Aracle  and Sir George Brooks, names famous in  English history. He died in Canajoharie,  New York, August it, 1902. He came to  the Urtited States with his parents and     grew to great prominence in business and  political life. He was twelve years of age  when he came to Canajoharie, where he was  educated in the public schools and at the  academy. He was for a time interested in  insurance, being connected with the local  company of which the well-known Judge  Spraker was president. He was later en-  gaged in farming. In 1863 he purchased  and edited the Radii, a weekly newspaper  founded in 1837 by Levi S. Backus, a deaf  mute. This paper was enlarged and re-  named The Canajoharie Radii and Taxpay-  er's Journal. L. F. Allen assumed an inter-  est at the same time, and under the firm  name of Arkell & Allen the publication was  continued until January i, 1866, when An-  gell Matthewson purchased Mr. Arkell's in-  terest. In 1859, in partnership with Benja-  min Smith, he began the manufacture of  I)aper and cotton sacks under the firm name  of Arkell & Smith. This was the beginning  of an immense business which later devel-  oped and still is one of the main industries  of the village of Canajoharie. During the  war the firm was hard pressed for a time.  William Arkell, coining to his son's assist-  ance, however, enabled him to pull througl\  safely, and by fortunate purchases of cotton  they made a large addition to their capital.  In 1884 the business was incorporated with  Mr. Arkell, president, Benjamin Smith, sec-  retary, and Adam Smith, treasurer. Mr.  Arkell was the inventor of the satchel bot-  tom paper sack and also the machine for  manufacturing the same ; this is the first on  record in the United States, if not in the  whole world, and the value of that patent  is bevond computation to this day. Mr.  Arkell became dee]ily interested in many  other business enterprises of his town and  state. He was the chief promoter and larg-  est owner of the Mt. McGregor railroad, and  for many years jirincipal owner of the  Albany Journal. Tie was always a power in  the newspaper world where he was well  known as a strong writer of editorials on  political and financial subjects. He was  high in the councils of the Republican  party and intimately known to the greatest  men of the same. He was a warm personal  friend of President Grant and during his last  week at Mount McGregor was a welcome  visitor to the stricken general. He was     SOUTHERN XEW YORK     59     elected state senator and was a leader in the  senate. His eloquence and practical busi-  ness experience rendered him a popular and  valuable servant of the state. He remained  active in business and retained his interest  and influence until his death. He was a  natural leader of men and there is scarcely  an interest in the town of Canajoharie that  did not have either its inception in his busy-  brain or receive hearty and material assist-  ance from his abundant resource. He read  widely and from his richly-stored mind  could draw a wealth of interesting facts for  platform or editorial purpose. Strong, con-  vincing and eloquent, he held his audiences  in closest attention and never failed to  arouse the enthusiasm of his hearers, yet  withal was the sound and safe man of af-  fairs, successfully conducting his own af-  fairs and aiding others along the road to  prosperity. He was a warm friend of the  American system of public schools and for  many years served on the village school  board. The high school building in Canajo-  harie owes its erection and subsequent use-  fulness largely to his untiring advocacy of  better educational facilities for the youth of  his village. He developed the water power  which turns the mill machinery and pat-  ented many of the devices now used in mak-  ing cotton bags and their later substitute,  made of paper. He acquired large tracts of  land and village property which he im-  proved. Nothing lay idle under his owner-  ship nor did he wait for the enterprise of  others to enrich his holdings. He was a  member of the Masonic order, and was lib-  eral in his religious ideas, helping all de-  nominations regardless of their sect, and  aiding every enterprise of value to the com-  munity.   He married, July 23, 1853, Sarah Hall,  born September 18. 183^, daughter of Ebe-  nezer and Elizabeth (Philip) Bartlett, of  Massachusetts, and granddaughter of  Joshua and Sarah Bartlett, of Blanford,  Massachusetts. Elizabeth Philip was daugh-  ter of \\'illiam and Elizabeth (Ostrander)  Philin. Children of Ebenezer and Elizabeth  Bartlett: Sarah Hall, married James Ar-  kell; Celeste, married Daniel Grafif; Mary  Augusta, married Cornelius Deyoe : Lydia  Frances, married James Green, M. D. ;  Franklin, married Anna Van Camp ; Kate     L., married John \'osburg. Children of  James and Sarah Hall (Bartlett) Arkell :  I. William J., born March 26, 1856; became  widely known as the owner of the illus-  trated periodicals Judge and Frank Leslie's:  he married Minnie Cahill ; children: i.  James, married Claire Matties; ii. Margher-  ita, married Arthur Dudley Warner. 2.  Mary P., married, May 4, 1880, Edward  Burnap, born in the town of Ephratah, Ful-  ton county, New York, November 24, 1858;  he was educated in the public schools of his  town and at Palatine Bridge; he entered  Union University, where he was graduated  A. B., class of 1879; he located at Canajo-  harie, where he was engaged in mercantile  life until 1885 ; in that year he became asso-  ciated with Arkell & Smith as manager, a  position he yet retains (1910) ; he is a mem-  ber of the Benevolent and Protective Order  of Elks, in politics a Democrat, and belongs  to Fort Rensselaer Club ; child, D. Arkell,  born September 16, 1883. 3. Laura. 4.  Bartlett, of whom further. 5. Bertelle H.,  married (first) Bernhard Gillam, who died  in 1896; married (second) Francis Edward  Barbour. Mrs. Sarah Hall (Bartlett) Arkell  survives her husband, a resident of Cana-  joharie, where she occupies the beautiful  mansion rebuilt in 1890.   (HI) Bartlett, second son of James and  Sarah H. (Bartlett) Arkell, was born in  i860, in Canajoharie, New York. He gradu-  ated from Williston Seminary, East Hamp-  ton. Massachusetts, in 1882, and from Yale  College, 1886. Turning his attention to  commercial pursuits he succeeded his father  as president of Arkell & Smith's, Canajo-  harie, and is now also president of the  Beech Nut Packing Company, of the same  place, and the Arkell Safety Bag Company,  of 95 Broad street. New York City. He is  a member of the University, Lotus and New  York Athletic clubs. Politically he sustains  the principles of the Republican party, and  was a presidential elector in 1904, placing  Theodore Roosevelt in the presidential  chair.     The family name, vari-  FULLERTON ously spelled Fullerton.   Fullarton, Foulerton and  Fowlerton, is quite widely extended through  out the British Isles. In Scotland, says the     6o     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Hon. Walter C. Anthony, 'it is traced back,  like the genealogy of every well regulated  Scotch family, to a very ancient day. and to  divers mythical ancestors. The clam: is  made that these old time worthies were the  hired masters of the hawks to the Stewarts  (later the royal family of Scotland) and that  the family name was derived from that cir-  cum.stance: they were Fowlers or Foolers  and their Keep or Castle was the Fowlers'  town. If left free to guess for myself I  should suspect that they were originally a  group of bleachers or fullers, and their ham-  let became known from the vocation, while  they themselves took their name from their  family home.' A fuller was one who thick-  ened or whitened cloth. There are records  in England, particularly in the hundred  rolls, of forms of the name such as Le Ful-  ler, and Lc Fullerc, with their Latinization  FuUo.   Fullerton or Fullarton is a burgh or estate  at Itvine in Ayrshire, Scotland, to which  place, according to one authority, the family  is traced as early as 1371. One of the name  was the rector of the parish church at Strat-  ford on Avon, England, for many years in  the eighteenth century, if the family records  are to be trusted. The best authenticated  statement, as to the branch of the Fullertons  here dealt with, makes them come from  Dublin, Ireland. The Fullertons appear in  Ireland at an early date. The name figures  in the 'Inrolments of the Decrees of Inno-  cents,' that is, those whose property was  exempted from confiscation in Ireland un-  der the Cromwellian settlement of 1654.  Cornet Neale Fullerton and Robert Fuller-  ton were mentioned in the Irish inrolments  of the adjudications, referring to the arrears  of the commissioned officers who served  Charles I. and Charles II. in the wars of  Ireland before the fifth day of June, 1649.   CI) William Fullerton. the first American  ancestor of the family of the Fullertons here  dealt with, was born in Dublin. Ireland, died  at Ncwburg, Orange county. New York, in  17S6. He first settled on his arrival in this  country at the old town of Minisink, Orange  county, New York, and became one of the  pioneer farmers of the neighborhood. He  married Sarah Cooley. Children: William,  mentioned below: Daniel, born March 21,  1767; Samuel, June 2, 1769; Phineas, July     5, 1771; Sarah, April 11, 1773; Jane, Decem-  ber 23, 1775.   (II) William (2), eldest son of William  (i) and Sarah (Cooley) Fullerton. was born  March 3, 1765. died at Minisink. Orange  county, New York, February 21, 1817. He  was a farmer, but engaged occasionally in  commercial transactions and took consider-  able interest in the public questions of the  day. He married Mary Whittaker, born  April 20. 1766. died in 1840. the daughter of  Benjamin Whittaker. who removed to Sus-  quehanna two or three years before Wyo-  ming was taken by the Indians in 1778.  when his daughter Mary was about twelve  years old. He returned to Minisink. but  after peace was established removed and  located at the Cookhouse, on the Delaware.  Mary remained at Minisink. her marriage  with \\'illiam Fullerton having then taken  place. Mary (Whittaker) Fullerton was  one of the few survivors of the terrible In-  dian massacre at Wyoming. She was  among the fugitives who fled from Wyo-  ming Valley after witnessing the horrors of  that famous massacre. Among the school  children whose faces were marked with  paint by Brandt in order that their lives  might be spared by his followers was this  Polly (Mary) W'hittaker. She with her par-  ents and other children fled through the wil-  derness towards their former house in  Orange county. Children: William. Dan-  iel. Stephen ^^^. mentioned below; Eliza-  beth.   (III) Stephen W.. son of William (2) and  Mary (Whittaker) Fullerton. was born at  Minisink. Orange county. New York, in  1793. died in 1855. In addition to working  on the farm he held various public offices  from time to time. He was a justice of the  peace for sixteen consecutive years ; for one  term. 1837. a member of the assembly and  in T840 appointed 'Associate County Judge'  of Orange county, an office under the con-  stitution of the state then in force, resem-  bling in its functi(Mis the justice of sessioiT^  of more recent times. This position he held  for five years.   These offices, while unini])ortant in them-  selves, show that Mr. Fnllcrtcin was held in  esteem in the communitv in which he lived.  It may be that the fact that he held these  offices and the nature of the business to      ('t/c^^i^Ce^ ci-t i-c-'^^,^,.^::;^Co^z;^^x-__     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     6i     which they led him to give more or less of  his time, had some influence in leading three  of his sons to adopt the law as their voca-  tion. The Hon. Walter C. Anthony say^  of him: 'He was a man of great strength,  close built and stocky, unusually quick and  active, both physically and mentally, sympa-  thetic, generous, and kindly. His complex-  ion was sandy, and his hair was somewhat  brighter in hue than 'auburn- in his early  days. He sometimes spoke of himself as  'old sorrel.' As illustrative of his physical  strength and courage and his loyalty to a  comrade, though in this case it was only a  dog, I give this instance, which is told rrie  by one of his sons. One Sunday afternoon  he was looking after his cattle in some of  the back fields of his farm ; his only com-  panion was his dog and his only weapon  was his walking stick. In some way the dog  managed to get into an altercation with an  old she wild cat and was rapidly being con-  verted into strips and shreds. That was  enough to arouse the Fullerton fighting  blood and the old gentleman went to the  assistance of the dog. When the contest  ended Mr. Fullerton was decidedly the  worse for wear and his clothing was in tat-  ters but the wild cat was dead. Mr. Ful-  lerton had finally got her by the throat and  literally choked her to death.'   He married Esther Stephens, the daugh-  ter of Holloway Stephens. Children: i.  Daniel, born February lo, 1814. 2. Eliza-  beth, married Peter J\lills. 3. William, men-  tioned below. 4. Mary, married Coe Mills.  5. Holloway S. 6. Stephen W., mentioned  below. 7. Peter P. 8. Benjamin S. 9. John  Henry. 10. Elsie T., married John H. Deck-  er. II. Esther I., married a Mr. Wallace.  12. Frances E., married Isaac Halstead.   (I\^) Judge William Fullerton, second  son of Stephen W. and Esther (Stephens)  Fullerton, was born at Minisink, Orange  county. New York, May i, 1817, died at  Newburg, Orange county. New York, March  15, 1900.   He had been a member of the bar of New  York City for nearly half a century and had  probalily tried more important cases than  any of his legal brethren. By general con-  sent he had been conceded to be the ablest  jury lawyer in the metropolitan district  since the death of James T. Brady, having     a profound knowledge of human nature, be-  ing quick and ready in debate and thor-  oughly posted on the fundamental principles  of law. He was pre-eminently a great ad-  vocate, and as a cross-examiner was in his  prime without a peer.   His youth was passed on his father's farm  and in 1837 he was graduated with honors  from Union College, having made his way  through school by teaching. Subsequently  he studied law and was admitted to the bar  in 1840. He at once commenced practicing  in Goshen. He soon moved to Newburg,  where in the next few years he was retained  on one side or the other in most of the lead-  ing cases tried in this and adjoining coun-  ties. In 1852 he was called upon to try a  very important case in the second judicial  district of New York state. It hajjpened  that his opponent was Charles O'Conor,  then recognized as the most prominent lead-  er of the bar. The case was tried in Brook-  lyn and though closely contested resulted  in the success of young Fullerton. Mr. O'-  Conor was impressed with the ability of his  determined adversary and invited him to  become a partner, the proposition was ac-  cepted. He at once joined Mr. O'Conor in  New York and took the high place in his  profession which he ever afterwards main-  tained.   Perhaps the most noted effort in the ca-  reer of Air. Fullerton was in the cross-exam-  ination of Henry Ward Beecher, in the great  case of Tilton vs. Beecher, which, on ac-  count of the distinction of the parties con-  cerned, was extensively reported, and ex-  cited more public notice than perhaps any  other tried in the United States. It was a  combat of intellectual giants and Mr. O'-  Conor characterized Judge Fullerton's  cross-examination as the ablest ever con-  ducted.   In 1867 while in Canada on his annual  fishing trip with Chester A. Arthur and  other friends, he was appointed justice of  the supreme court to fill a vacancy in his  district, this being without his knowledge.  The appointment thus made him e.x-ofificio  member of the court of appeals, and at the  following election the people of the district  elected him without opposition. Judge Ful-  lerton's services in the court of appeals add-  ed to his reputation as an advocate and     'I     62     SOUTH F.RX NEW YORK     jurist. On December 30, 1867, John K.  Porter, a member of the court of appeals,  wrote a letter from Albany to Charles O'-  Conor in which he said he proposed soon to  resign. It was his expressed desire that  Judge Fullerton should be appointed as his  successor. Mr. O'Conor was thoroughly in  sympathy with Judge Porter and sought to  induce Mr. Fullerton to accept the appoint-  ment, but the attraction and emoluments of  his career as an advocate led Air. Fullerton  to continue in active practice to the end.   Judge Fullerton married, in 1840, Cornelia  M.. daughter of Henry Gale, a merchant of  Orange county (see Gale VII.) They had  children as follows: i. William, who com-  pleted his musical studies in Heidelberg,  Germany. Many of his compositions were  published and won immediate recognition.  He died in England in 1888 in his thirty-  fourth year. 2. Augusta, married E. B.  Rudd and has one daughter Alice R., who  married Mr. Otis, and now resides in New-  burg, New York; children: W'illiam Fuller-  ton, born in 1893; Charles Augustus, 1895;  Philip Stewart, 1900. 3. Mary. 4. Anna.  The two latter died in infancy.   (IV) Judge Stephen W. (2) Fullerton,  son of Stephen W. (i) and Esther (Stephens)  Fullerton. was born October 17, 1823, died  in Goshen, New York, in 1902. He was  admitted to the bar of New York in 1844.  It would not be easy to define the qualities  which distinguished Stephen W. Fullerton  alx)\e his fellows as a lawyer. He had that  strange faculty which is sometimes spoken  of as 'presence,' sometimes as 'magnet-  ism,' which compels men to recognize and  acknowledge those who possess it as the  appointed leaders of their fellows. It was  chiefly in the trial of causes that he excelled ;  and so marked was his skill in this, the most  difficult dei^artment of a lawyer's work, that  attorneys from neighboring counties have  been known to remain at our county seats  over night merely in order that they might  watch, for a few hours longer, the methods  of a master-workman.   It is useless, however, to attempt to con-  vey any idea of the man himself by men-  tioning separate traits of his character. His  great ciiarm lay in his personality. He was  gentle as a child, but merciless to those who  sought to wrong his clients. Courageous     was he, to a marked degree, but cautious  withal. Tactful and adaptive, but never  waiving his clients' rights. He was mod-  est, unassuming, and free from pretence, but  always resourceful and self-reliant. But  above all he was the most loyal and unself-  ish of friends, not in any mere sentimental  way but in actual helpfulness to the extent  of self sacrifice on his own part. His gen-  erosity knew no limit except that imposed  by his own circumstances. With him it was  no dividing of his last crust with a friend.  If the situation demanded it the friend  would be free to the whole crust.   Judge Fullerton married Mary Halstead  and one son was born to them, Frank.  (The Gale Line.)   The word 'Gael' means an Irishman or  a Scotchman in the original Gaelic or Celtic  language of Ireland and Scotland. The Fac-  lair Gaidhlig or Gaelic Dictionary of E. Mac-  Donald and Company. (Edinburgh, 1902),  says: 'The difference between the Irish and  the Scots is geographical only and not racial,  as the records of both amply and abundant-  ly prove. Both call themselves 'Gaidhacl'  (Gael) in their own language, and fraternize  instantly as soon as English, the language  of disunion is dropped.' Gale therefore may  very easily be a form of Gael. Gale mav,  however, be just as easily a form of 'Gall.'  which in Gaelic means 'foreigner or strang-  er.' This appears indeed a more probable  derivation than the other, the name pre-  sumably being applied originally to some  stranger appearing in a Gaelic speaking ter-  ritory of Ireland or Scotland. Still another  derivation has been given. Thus Lower in  his 'Dictionary of Family Names of tlu-  United Kingdom; London, i860' says:  'Gael. The Gaels of Charlton Kings, c.  Gloucester, have written themselves at vari-  ous periods Galle, Gale, Gael and originally  De Galles. If this be correct the family may  have been of \\'elsh origin in Anglo-Norman  times when the country was known as  Gales or Gales.'   (I) Edmund Gale, the supposed first  .American ancestor of the Gales here dcal^  with, was born probably in Great Britain or  Ireland, died in Boston in 1642. He lived  at Cambridge, Massachusetts. Nothing is  known of his wife but his supposed children  were: i. Thomas, who probably married be-     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     63     fore coming to America, settling at New  Haven, Connecticut, where he had : Martha,  baptized March 18, 1660; Abigail, baptized  June 22, 1660. 2. Robert, who receipted.  May 14, 1659, sugar of W'illiam Hollisworth  at Salem and again in 1666 receipted three  thousand nine hundred lbs. of Muscovado  sugar at Salem. 3. Ambrose, married Deb-  orah . 4. Bartholomew, married Mary   . 5. Edward, married Sarah Dixey. 6.   Abell, mentioned below. 7. l-'liazer, mar-  ried Elizabetli Bishop.   (II) Abell, son of Edmund Gale, was  probably born at New Haven, Connecticut,  probably died at Jamaica, Long Island, New  York. He first appears as having granted  to him 'a lot to set his house on' in Jamaica  October 18, 1665. He was called 'husband-  man' and in 1683, his rate list contained two  horses, two oxen, four 'cowse,' two three-  year olds; three two-year olds; six swine;  twenty-one acres of land ; and 'the head,'  total value ninety-eight pounds sterling ten  shillings. Subsequent to this date he oc-  casionally bought and sold land as shown  by deeds still on record. The history of  Jamaica shows that the first settlers were  from Massachusetts and that Abell was a  member of the First Presbyterian church.  He married a woman whose first name was  Dinah, but whose other name remains un-  known.

Long  Island, and was a miller until 1721 when he  sold out for one thousand five hundred  pounds sterling and removed the same year  to Goshen, where he became one of the pro-  prietors of the new town. The records of  Jamaica say but little about the Gales.  John, however, it is recorded, obtained leave  of the town 'to set up a great mill' April  I. 1701. He was a soldier in Captain Peter  Schuyler's company in 1602. probably to  serve against the French ; February 4. 1708-g  was rated si.xteen shillings and cightpence     on minister's salary and was a vestryman  in 1717. In Goshen, John was appointed an  elisor in a suit by the court in 1726. His  will was dated May 3, 1746 and proved Oc-  tober 24, 1750. He named apparently all  his children in his will.

The early immigrants to New  .SMITH England were mostly artisans   and most of them men of little  learning. That they were • possessed of  strong characters is evidenced in a thousand  ways to the student of history. ^^M^ilc the  pen was an awkward instrument to many of  them, they were industrious and conquered     64     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     the wilderness, establishing the foundation  of the civilization which we now enjoy.  Among the most useful men in the colonies  were the smiths who made all the nails used  in the construction of buildings and nearly  all implements of every sort employed in the  rude life of the pioneers. A century previ-  ous the country people in England had taken  surnames, and it fell out that many who  were smiths by occupation took the word  for a patronymic. In the midst of these,  where Christian names were oft repeated, it  has been difficult to trace a line of descent  in many cases.   (I) Among the numerous Smith families  of the first settlers of Connecticut, was a  family of four brothers and a sister, who  settled in Hartford and vicinity, of whom  further. It is not known that their parents  came to this country, i. Mary, married Will-  iam Partridge. 2. Christopher, resided at  Northampton and died without issue. 3.  Simon, who was one of the twenty-eight  original proprietors of Haddam, Connecti-  cut, coming from Hartford. 4. Joseph, set-  tled in Hartford, and had fifteen children. 5.  William, settled in Wethersfield.   (II) Benjamin, son of Simon Smith, was  born in 1664 in Haddam, and married Han-  nah Scoville. They had sons, Benjamin,  Jacob, Deacon Joseph, and Daniel, of whom  further.   (III) Daniel, son of Benjamin and Han-  nah (Scoville) Smith, was born in 1714 in  Haddam, and married in 1739; the name of  his wife is not preserved. She died in 1745,  and he died July 29, 1793. in Haddam.   (IV) William, son of Daniel Smith,  passed his life in Haddam in the old house  just north of the present jail. He was a  seafaring man in the West Indies trade,  owned and commanded vessels, and lost his  life when only forty years of age. His wife's  baptismal name was Martha, and their chil-  dren were: Jeffrey, of whom further; Jona-  than, Ezra, Lucy, married Captain Brainerd  of New York City, and lived to the age of  106 years; Esther, married Luther Board-  man of Higganum ; Martha, married George  Kelsey of Haddam. All of the sons were  soldiers of the revolution.   (V) Jeffrey, eldest child of William and  Martha Smith, was born in 1763 in Haddam,  and grew to manhood in his native place.     He served an apprenticeship as a blacksmith,  and then settled in Madison, Connecticut,  locating on the Neck, where he bought a  small farm, which he cultivated in connec-  tion with his work in the smithy. He built  a fine dwelling house on this tract and there  spent his life, dying February i, 1846. He  served during the entire period of the revo-  lution in the Continental Hne, and was among  the soldiers who drove the cattle across the  Hudson river on the ice in the movement  of Washington's army. Both his brothers  who were captured died on board the Jer-  sey prison ship in New York Harbor, and  were buried near the monument erected at  Wallabout Bay to the memory of the un  fortunate men who thus perished. Jeffrey  Smith survived the hardships of a long and  most arduous service, and drew a pension  in his old age. He married Dorothy Hub-  bard, a native of Haddam, who died in Mad-  ison, July 13, 1836. Children; i. Jonathan,  born January 4, 1785. 2. Daniel Hubbard.  March 23, 1787. 3. Ezra, of whom further.  4. 'Esther, born October 16, 1790, married  Dudley Brainerd. 5. Austin, died in infancy.  6. Austin, February 9, 1794- 7- ^larvin,  1796. 8. David, 1798. 9. Samuel, August  16, 1799, lived and died in Madison in the  house where he was born. 10. Junius,  March 25, 1801. n. Helena, died in her  fourth year.   ( \'l ) Ezra, third son of Jeffrey and Doro-  thy (Hubbard) Smith, was born December  16, 1788, in Madison, and died there April  12, 1875. He married, October 3, 1813,  Martha Stone, who was born in East Guil-  ford. March 12, 1786, and died June 12,  1849.

Elizabeth,  born January 7, 1869; married, in Novem-  ber, 1891, Thaddeus F. Leete, a direct de-  scendant of Governor Leete ; she has three  daughters, Emma, Dorothy and Caroline,  and resides in Madison.   (VIII) Gerrit, eldest child of Andrew  Norman and Lydia S. (Kelsey) Smith, was  born January 8, 1854, in Madison, attended  the district schools and also Lee's Academy  in that town. In 1873 he entered Yale Col-  lege, from which he graduated in 1877, with  the degree of Bachelor of Arts. Following  this he attended Yale Law School, and  graduated in 1880. At the September term  of the superior court, at New Haven, in  1882, he was admitted to the bar, and in  the same month was admitted to the su-  preme court, second department, in Kings  county, New York. He located in the City  of New York, and for ten years maintained  a law office at No. 33 Wall street, and for  the succeeding ten years was located at No.  43, on the same street. For seven years he  was located at 52 Broadway, and in 1908  removed to the United States Express  building. He has built up a large and lucra-  tive law practice making a specialty of cor-  poration, real estate and probate law. With  his family, Mr. Smith is affiliated with the  Congregational church, and politically he is  a Republican, though not active in practical  politics. He is a member of Empire State  Chapter, Society of American Wars.   He married (first), November 22, 1882, in  New Haven, Connecticut, Leila Wood, born  March 27, i8c;6, in Berlin, Connecticut,  daughter of Charles Wood. She died in     New York City, July 6, 1903.

The family resides at present in  Brewerton, New York.     The surname Millard i s  MILLARD French, the family being of   French Huguenot stock.  There is an English form of the name, formed  by dropping the 'w' from Milhvard. mean-  ing the 'ward or guardian of the mill'', just  as the 'w' dropped from Woodward leaves  Woodard. The name first appears in Ameri-  can colonial records in 1654, when lands in  Massachusetts and afterwards in New Hamp-  shire were granted to Luke Millard. In 1670  John Millard had a grant of land from Wil-  liam Penn in Pennsylvania and another had  lands in Virginia. Through intermarriage the  Millards are connected with many of the old-  est families of the United States, notably the  Coffins, Folgers, Starbucks, of Nantucket and  Massachusetts ; the Greens and Browns, of  Rhode Island ; the Akins, of Dutchess county.  New York; the Ten Eyckes, of Albany; the  Bellons and Goulds, of New Haven, and many  others.   f I) John Millard, the progenitor in America  of the family of the Millards here dealt with,  was born probably about 1600, died in Reho-  both, Massachusetts. No details are available  in the records indicating his occupation, but he  was admitted a freeman of Newport, Rhode  Island. He stayed in Newport for a number  of years, but finally settled at Rehoboth, Mas-  sachusetts. He married, all that is known of  his wife being that her first name was Eliza-  beth.     66     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     (II) Robert, son of John and Elizabeth  Millard, was born in 1632, died in Rehoboth,  Massachusetts, March 16, 1699. Very little is  known of the events of his life, but it is prob-  able that he was a farmer and a man of wealth  and influence in view of his good marriage.  He married, November 24, 1663, Elizabeth,  died February 7, 1717, eldest daughter and  second child of William Sabin, the immigrant  ancestor of the Sabins in America. William  Sabin first appears in 1643 at the organization  of the county of Rehoboth, Massachusetts. It  is not known when or how he came to Amer-  ica. He was a Frenchman, and it is believed  that after leaving France he settled for a time  in Wales and the south of England. He was  a man of wealth, culture and an exceedingly  fine and generous nature, if one can judge  from his gifts to relieve the wants of those  who suffered from the Indian raids. He was  a leader in Plymouth public affairs, in the  church and in the schools of Rehoboth, Massa-  chusetts. His first wife died in 1660. Her  name is not known. He married (second)  Martha, born December 11, 1641, (twin of  Mary), daughter of James and Anna Allen  of Medfield. William' Sabin died about 1687.  His will was probated in Boston, Massachu-  setts, July 17, 1687. In it he names sixteen  of his twenty children, the second of them  being the wife of Robert Millard.   (HI) Nchemiah. son of Robert and Eliza-  beth (Sabin) Millard, was born in Rehoboth,  Massachusetts, June 8, 1668, died July 23.  1 75 1. Beyond the bare records of the birth  and death of Nehemiah very little is known  of him. It is probable that he combined with  the agricultural pursuits in which everyone to  some extent engaged in those days, profes-  sional or mercantile work of some kind. He  married (first) Judith, the daughter of a Mr.  Mason, and (second) Phoebe Shore, who died  March 11, 1717.   (TV) Rev. Robert (2) Millard, son of Ne-  hemiah and Judith (Mason) Millard, was  born at Rclinboth, Massachusetts, April 2,  1700, died at Nine Partners, New York, March  7. 1780. He was a minister of the Baptist  church, his last charge being Pawling, Dutch-  ess county. New York, where he continued  tmtil a short time before his death at the age  of eighty. He married, March 7, 1726, Han-  nah, born in Bristol. Rhode Island, daufrhter  of Eleazar and Elizabeth (Cobb) Eddy,     granddaughter of John and Deliverance  (Owen) Eddy, great-granddaughter of the  first American ancestor, Samuel Eddy, and his  wife, Elizabeth. Samuel Eddy was the son of  the Rev. William Eddye, vicar of St. Dun-  stan's, Cranbrook, England. Children : John,  of whom further, and Jonathan.   (V) John (2), son of Rev.

He spent some years at Corn-  wall, being educated in the schools of the  locality, though his studies, like every trans-  action of any kind, were interrupted by the  events and disturbances preceding and accom-  panying the outbreak of the revolutionary war.  Charles served in the war during its last year,  as he was a mere youth during most of the  time it continued. He was in the army of  Newburg under Washington, when Arnold,  the traitor, fled from West Point. At an early  age he settled in Poughkeepsie, Dutchess coun-  ty, New York. But after the war he settled  finally at Marlboro, Ulster county. New York,  and there he conducted a cord factory run by  water power on Buckley's Creek. Part of this  old factory was still standing some years ago.  To his cord factory he joined a lumber busi-  ness and seems to have l)een an energetic and  capable business man. He took considerable  interest in public affairs though there is no  record to the effect that he held or sought to  hold any public position. He was. however,  one of the first of the bench of ruling elders  of the Presbyterian church. Marlboro, being  installed into this office in 1810.

He was in Poughkeepsie only in his  early years, having moved to Marlboro with  his parents. It was in Marlboro that he was  brought up and attended the district schools.  In 1812 when he was about twenty-three years  old he began to teach school himself, but did  not stay long at that avocation. In course of  time he removed to Brooklyn, New York,  where he engaged in the wholesale grocery  business. He continued in this business for a  considerable number of years, building up a  trade of considerable size and gathering to-  gether a comfortable fortune. When he  thought that it was time to retire he pur-  chased a great deal of real estate, some of  which is still in the possession of the family,  and spent the rest of his life in looking after  his property and watching its development.  He was a man of a deeply religious cast of  mind and was a regular attendant at the  Presbyterian church of which he was a mem-  ber. His body was brought from Brooklyn,  New York, to Poughkeepsie.

His father was John Purdy, a son  of Joseph, a son of Francis, who is said to  have come from some part of England in  1658, settling in Fairfield, Connecticut. The  Purdys were, according to one account,  originally from Wales, and are said to have  settled in the course of time in some part of  England. The two sons of Francis Purdy,  Joseph and Francis, were commissioned sur-  veyors by the Crown and sent to America.  The Rev. John Smith, D. D., of previous  mention, was born in England in 1702. He  wa.s educated at Oxford and for thirty years,  until his death in 1771, served as a pastor of  the Presbyterian church at Rye, Westchester  county, New York. He married Mehitable  Hooker, a great-granddaughter of the Rev.  Thomas Hooker, the founder of Hartford,  Connecticut, in 1636.   (VIII) Samuel N., son of John (3) and  Sarah (Purdy) Millard, was born April 13,  1829, at Brooklyn, New York, and died June,  1901, at Newburg, Orange county. New York.  He was educated in the public schools of  Brooklyn, and when he left school engaged in  the silver plating business in which he con-  tinued for some years. In 1856 he went with  his brother to Marlboro and 'there started a  business dealing in lumber, coal, lime, and  building materials. In addition to these in-  terests they engaged in the produce business  and owned the screw steamer, 'Wyoming,'  which plied three times a week to New York  and back. Both Samuel and his brother were  successful in business, and in 1872 when he  was about forty-three years old Samuel was  able to retire, and live in Marlboro.

R., born August 11, 1911.     The original settler of  VAN BUREN the Van Buren family   did not bear the name  Van Buren. It was not the custom, when  he came to America, 1631, for Netherlanders  ti:> have a family name, except in rare cases.  The Dutch of New Netherland, after the  succession of the English in 1664, began to  adopt family surnames, generally taking the  name of the place from which they or their  parents amigrated in Holland, using the  profix 'Van,' which is Dutch for of or from.  Thus it was, no doubt, with the second gen-  eration of the Van Buren family in Ameri-  ca, the father of whom was Cornells Maes-  sen — Maes or Maas, being the Christian  name of his father, the suffix 'sen' or 'se'  signifying son.   (I) Cornells Maessen either emigrated  from Buren, a village of the province of  Gelderland, Holland, or was a native of that  place. During the summer of 1631 he sailed  for America in the ship 'Rensselaerwyck,'  having with him his young wife, Catalyntje  Martense (daughter of a man named Mar-  ten), and at least one son named Marten.  A second son Hendrick is said to have been  born on the voyage. They settled on a farm  a little below Greenbush, at a place callel     Papsknee, leasing a farm from the Patroon  Killian Van Rensselaer, who had been  granted large tracts comprising large por-  iions of the present counties oi Albany and  Rensselaer, then called Rensselaersvvyck.  He and his wife died in 1648, and the rec-  ords show they were buried the same day.  He died intestate, and the children were  placed under guardians. His estate con-  sisted in part ot property in New York City,  where is now between Fourteenth and  Christopher streets. Children mentioned in  legal papers: Marten C, see forward; Hend-  rick, Maes, Styntje.   (II) Marten Cornelisse, 'Black Marten'  (son of Cornells Maessen) deposed, 1660.  that he w^as 'born in Houten,' a few miles  from the village of Buren, in the province of  Utrecht. He was probably about two years  of age when his parents came to America.  in 1662 he sold his home, located 'this side  of Bethlehem' (about two miles below Al-  bany). In 1665 he leased half of Consta-  pel's Island below Albany. He and his wife  were members of the Dutch Church in Al-  bany in 1683. The census of 1697 credits  his family with a membership of 'two men,  no women, one child.' In December, 1683,  he paid church dues for the rise of the  'large pall,' indicating that at about that  time he had buried an adult member of his  family. In 1700 he was captain of a mili-  tary company in the regiment commanded  by Colonel Pieter Schuyler. He married  Maritje, daughter of Pieter Quackenbosch.  llis will, made April 13, 1703, proved June  7, 1710 (in which latter year he died), men-  tions children : Cornelis Martense, Cornelia  Martense, Pieter Martense, Maitje Mar-  tense, Marten Martense.   (III) Pieter Martense, son of Marten Cor-  nelisse Van Buren, married, January 15,  1693, Ariaantje Barentse, daughter of  Barent Meindersen and Eytje (Ida) his  wife. Pieter M. and his wife were admitted  to membership of the Dutch Church at Al-  bany in 1695, as from Kinderhook, where  they had settled about the time of their mar-  riage. He was a freeholder in Kinderhook  in 1720. and probably died previous to 1743,  which vear four of his sons were mentioned  as freeholders of Kinderhook. His children  were baptized in the Dutch Church, Al-  bany: Cornelis, Barent, Marritje (Maria),     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     69     Eytje (Ida), Marten, Cornells, Ephrahim  and Maria.   (IV) Marten Pleterse, fourth son of  Pieter Martense and Arlaantje (Barentse)  \'an Buren, was born December 25, 1701,  in Kinderhook, where he resided.

His house, an unpre-  tentious one, was long used as a tavern.  Although a man of quiet and undemon-  strative nature, he rendered valued service  in the revolutionary army, rising to the rank  of captain in Colonel Abraham Van Al-  styne's regiment. He married Maria Goes,  widow of Johannes Van Allen, who was dis-  tantly related to him. Children : Dircke,  born 1777; Jannetje. baptized January 16,  1780: Martin, mentioned below; Lawrence,  SPECL\L— LEWIS— TWO   Januar}' i, 1786, a farmer of Kinderhook  and major in the war of 1812; Abraham.  May II, 1788, an attorney practising in  Hudson, New York.   (YD Martin ^'an Buren, eldest son of  .Abraham and Maria (Goes) Van Buren,  eighth president of the United States, was  born December 5. 1782, in Kinderhook. He  was blessed with keen perceptions and in-  tellectual power, and finished his studies in  school at the age of fourteen years. At this  time he began the study of law. and very  soon became active in political matters, act-  ing as a delegate to the congressional con-  vention of his district at the age of seven-  teen. In his very active life he came in con-  tact with many of the ablest people of the  world, and the lack of a colleee education  was never apparent to any. At the age of  twentv-five years he was appointed by Gov-  ernor Daniel D. Tompkins as surrogate of  Columbia county, and filled this position for  five years, from 1808. In- the fall of 1812 he     was elected to the state senate, and con-  tinued to serve in this capacity until 1821.  From 1815 to 1819, he was attorney-general  of the state. In 1821, in his thirtj'-ninth  year, he was elected to the United States  senate and was re-elected in 1827. In the  fall of the following year he was elected  governor of the state, and resigned from the  United States senate January 15, 1821, to  be inaugurated as governor. He did not  long retain this position, however, as he was  induced by President Andrew Jackson to  take the portfolio of secretary of state in the  latter's cabinet. In June, 1831, he resigned  from the President's cabinet in order to be-  come minister to the Court of St. James.  Upon the second election of Andrew Jack-  son to the presidencv Martin Van Buren  was his companion on the ticket and was  elected vice-president. Following this he  was elected president, being the first native  of the state of New York to reach that posi-  tion by election, taking his seat March 4,  1837. In the campaign of 1840 he was de-  feated for a re-election by William H. Har-  rison, and retired, after the close of his term  in 1841, to his home, 'Lindenwald.'   ^ -^   This is a very old fam-  HASBROUCK ily of Southern New   York and was founded  by Abraham and Jean Hasbrouck,  brothers, who were among the original  patentees of New Paltz. Ulster county.  They w-ere active in both the civil and  ecclesiastical affairs of that section and both  left large families whose descendants have  to some e.xtent intermarried. From Ulster  county the family spread to Orange county,  Dutchess county, and other counties in the  vicinity, and it is now numerously repre-  sented throughout the state. The family  was conspicuous in the settlement and de-  velopment of St. Lawrence county, and of  various sections of Central New York.  Abraham and Jean Hasbrouck were bo^h  born in Calais, France, of which town their  father was a native. The latter with his  two sons above mentioned and a daughter,  who was the wife of Pierce Haynar, was  driven out of France by the persecution of  the Huguenots, and removed to Mannheim,  Germany, in the lower palatinate, where  they resided several years, highly respected     70     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     and being affiliated with the local churches.  Numerous other families were similarly sit-  uated and a considerable group migrated  to the new world in the latter part of the  seventeenth century, settling in Ulster coun-  ty, New York. Jean, with his wife, Anna  Duyon (Deyo) Hasbrouck, removed in  1673 from Germany and settled at Esopus,  New York.   (I) Abraham Hasbrouck, the immigrant  ancestor of the branch of the New York  family of the Hasbroucks here dealt with,  was born in France, and died at New Paltz,  Ulster county. New York, March 17, 17 17.  Abraham Hasbrouck removed from Holland  to Mannheim, and then to England, whence  he sailed in April, 1675, landing at Boston,  Massachusetts. From here he proceeded di-  rect to New York and in July arrived at  Esopus, where he found his brother and  many former European friends. In 1677 a  groun of these, including the Hasbrouck  brothers, obtained a patent from Governor  Andros to a large tract south of Kingston.  where they settled and named the place.  New Paltz. Here they founded what was  known as the Walloon Protestant Church,  after the name and discipline of the church  at Geneva, a Calvinistic organization. For  about half a century, until after the death  of the Hasbrouck brothers, the service was  conducted in French, long after which it  was conducted in the Dutch language.  Abraham Hasbrouck was a member of the  provincial assembly and was major of the  Ulster county regiment of militia. He mar-  ried, November 17, 167.S. at Hurley, Marie,  daughter of Christian Deyo, whom he had  known in Europe and who came to this  country in the same vessel with him. She  was probably a sister of his brother's wife.  Their children were: Rachel, baptized May  12, 1680. New York; Anna. October g, 1682,  at Kingston, died young; Joseph, mentioned  below: Solomon, born October 17, 1686;  Jonas, born October 14, i6qi ; Benjamin,  baptized May 31, 1696, at New Paltz.   (IT) Joseph, eldest son of Abraham and  Marie CDeyo) Hasbrouck, was born and  baptized at New Paltz, Ulster county. New-  York, October 23, 1684. He located at Guil-  ford on a tract of two thousand acres which  had been granted by patent in 1683 to James  Graham and John Delavall. The parchment     on which the grant of the Guilford tract  was written is in a good state of preserva-  tion. He was one of the justices of the  county of Ulster in 1722 and his name is  mentioned in a record of that date as hav-  ing proceeded with two other justices and  an Indian to locate definitely the southwest  corner of the Paltz patent at Moggonck.  The diary of Joseph's son. Colonel Abraham  Hasbrouck, says that he was 'a gentleman  much respected by those with ''hom he w;.s  acquainted and he served in several public  stations in Ulster county. He was very  affable and agreeable in company, eloquent  in speech, spoke French, Dutch, and toler-  al)le English.' Joseph Hasbrouck is buried  in the old graveyard in New Paltz and the  stone which marks his last resting place  bears the oldest date of any in the grave-  vard. It is of brown sandstone, such as  was used at that period ; at the top of the  stone is an angel's head and wings : the in-  scription is as follows : 'Here lyes the Body  of Joseph Hasbrouck, Esq., aged forty years,  three months, and eighteen days, deceased,  January 28, 1723-4.'   He married in 1706 Ellsje Schoonmaker,  who was buried near her husband, outliving  him by forty years. She lost her husband  when she was thirty-seven and was left  with ten children on her hands, while her  oldest boy, Abraham, was only seventeen.  But she did not move back to New Paltz  from Guilford, whither they had gone prob-  ably at the time of their marriage in 1706.  She raised her family of six sons and four  daughters. In her later years when the  neighborhood increased she kept a store in  the house. Children: Abraham, married  Catherine Bruyn and located at Kingston ;  Isaac, married Antje Low, widow of John  Van Gasbeck, and located a short distance  east of old .Shawangunk church : Jacob,  married Mary Hornbeck ancl moved to Mar-  bletown : Benjamin, married Elidia Schoon-  maker and located at what is now the Bor-  den residence of Wallkill ; Cornelius B.,  who married Janet Kelso: Jonathan, men-  tioned below.   (Ill) Jonathan, youngest son of Joseph  and Ellsie ('Schoonmaker) Hasbrouck. was  born at Guilford, Ulster county, New York,  .'\])ri! 12, 1722, and died July 31. 1780.  Jonathan located at Newburg, Orange     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     county, purchasing in 1747 the property on  which he built in 1750 part of the house  afterward known as Washington's head-  quarters. Subsequently he built an addition  to this house, where he resided until his  death. He was the first supervisor of the  precinct in 1763. He held at different times  commissions as ensign, captain and colonel,  his commission to the latter office being  issued October 25, 1775. His regiment saw  much active service in the revolutionary  war, but owing to the ill health of its col-  onel was much of the time commanded by  Lieutenant Colonel Johannas Hardenbergh.  On account of ill health Colonel Jonathan  Hasbrouck resigned in 1777. The diary of  his brother. Colonel Abraham Hasbrouck,  of Kingston, says of him in part: 'He was  a lo\-ing husband, a tender and loving  father, a loving brother, an obedient and  dutiful child, a kind master to his servants,  a good neighbor, a hospitable man, a good  industrious sober man, and a very good  liver, and a very good commonwealth's man  (Whig). He was a pious worthy man, paid  a good deal of reverence in hearing and  reading the Word of God. He was good  natured, not easily ruffled or put in a pas-  sion, but with a great deal of forbearance.'  He married, in May, 1751. Catherine or  Tryntje, daughter of Cornelius DuBnis, of  Poughwoughtenonk. Their children were :  Abraham; Joseph; Cornelius, born in 1755,  settled in Canada, took the side of the Brit-  ish in the revolutionary war; Isaac, men-  tioned below; Jonathan, who died unmar-  ried: Mary, who was born in 1763, and  married Israel Smith ; Rachel, the heroine  of the famous ride from Newburg to Guil-  ford, married her cousin Daniel, son of Col-  onel Abraham Hasbrouck, of Kingston, and  located at Montgomery, Orange cotinty.  New York.   (IV) Isaac, fourth son of Jonathan and  Catherine or Tryntje CDuBois) Hasbrouck,  was born in 1761, and died in 1806. Isaac  Hasbrouck continued to reside at the Wash-  ington headquarters built by his father. He  married Hannah Birdsall. Their children  were : Jonathan, married Phebe Field, and  left a large family of sons and daughters,  all of whom were born at the Washington  headquarters; Israel; Eli, mentioned below;  Sarah, married ^^^^lter Case, and was the     only daughter who married ; Rachel ; May.   (V) Eli, third son of Isaac and Hannah  (Birdsall) Hasbrouck, was born at the  Washington headquarters, Newburg, Or-  ange county. New York. He married Har-  riet Belknap, and left a large family of chil-  dren, six of whom married and had chil-  dren.   (VI) Charles H., son of Eli and Harriet  (Belknap) Hasbrouck, was born at New-  burg, Orange county. New York, February  7, 1820, died at Newburg. January 30, 1895.  All his life long he lived in Newburg. Only  once did he leave the town, and that was  on the occasion of his voyage to Havre,  France, with his friend Captain Francis  Robinson. He attended the Newburg  schools and in 1844 was a clerk in the High-  land National Bank. Leaving the bank he  became a clerk for Lewis D. Lockwood, a  dealer in dry goods, and within two or  three years he and his brother Eli formed  a partnership in the dry goods business and  started a business in Water street, under  the style and title of the Hasbrouck  Brothers. This partnership continued to the  year 1879. In 1881 Mr. Hasbrouck was  elected director of the Quassaick National  Bank, and on September 21, 1885, he was  elected president, holding both positions  until his death. He married Helen, daugh-  ter of John and Margaret (Voorhees) Cur-  rie, of New Brunswick. Their children  were : John and Edward, who are deceased ;  Alice and Margaret C, who live at New-  burg, Orange county. New York.

He married  Janet Kelso, and had issue : William C, of  whom further.   (IV) Hon. William Cornelius Hasbrouck,  son of Cornelius B. Hasbrouck, was born  August 23, 1800, died November 5, 1870.  He was a graduate of Union College at the  same time, almost, that William Seward  was an undergraduate, and he soon moved  to Franklin, Tennessee, and became prin-  cipal of the academy there, founded by     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Bishop Otey. Among his pupils were such  distinguished men as John Bell, Samuel  Houston, FeHx Granby, Andrew Jackson  and Matthew F. Maury. Returning north  he became principal of Farmers' Hall Acad-  emy, Goshen, New York, and in 1822 com-  menced the study of law with Mr. Wisner.  He completed his studies with Mr. Ross  of Newburg and was admitted to the bar  in 1826. He rose rapidly in his profession  and was elected to the assembly and chosen  speaker of that body. He was a man of  high bearing, spotless character, and had a  chivalric sense of honor and duty. He was  described as courteous in his manners and  liberal in his charities, and an American in  every aspiration of his mind. He married,  June 28. 1831, Mary E., daughter of William  Roe. Children : \\'illiam, who became a  lawyer; Henry Cornelius, mentioned below;  Roe, now deceased, was a graduate of Har-  vard in 1876. and a lawyer; Maria H.. Mary  Roe Ann ; Emily Anna, who married Clin-  ton Gurnee ; Mary Elizabeth; Cornelia Jean-  ette ; Blandina, who married James Wild, of  Edinburgh, Scotland.   (V) General Cornelius Hasbrouck, sec-  ond son of William Cornelius and Mary E.  (Roe) Hasbrouck, was born at Newburg,  New York, October 26, 1839. He was ap-  pointed cadet at the West Point Military  Academy on July i, 1856, and made a cap-  tain on July 26, 1866. He remained a cap-  tain for over twenty years and then on  March 5, 1887, he was promoted to major;  ten years later, on October 29, 1896, he was  made a lieutenant-colonel; on February 13,  1899, he was made a colonel, and in 1898 he  was appointed brigadier-general, command-  ing the second division of the Second Army  Corps, U. S. A. He was a commandant at  West Point Military Academy from 1882 to  1888. He was a member of the board that  prepared the infantry, cavalry, and artillery  drill regulations adopted by the war depart-  ment for use in the United States Army.  He retired January 5, 1903.   General Hasbrouck died December 17,  191 1, in the house built, in 1839, by his  father, Hon. William C. Hasbrouck, at New  burg. New York. He was buried on De-  cember 20, with the military honors of his  rank, in the historic cemetery of the United  States Military Academy, at W'est Point,     New York. He married, October 26, 1882,  Laetitia \'iele Warren, who survives him.     This name is manifestly  VAN BUREN Dutch. The name of  the original settler, who  was the progenitor of the family in America,  appears in the records of the Reformed  Dutch Church of New York as Van Buren,  Van Beuren, Van Bueren, and Van Buuren.  His descendants, or rather the greater num-  ber of them, now spell the name Van  Beuren, in contradistinction to the Van  Buren family of the Upper Hudson, of  whom Cornells Maas Van Buren is the an-  cestor. This orthography does not obtain  in the case of the family here dealt with.  This particular family, which is descended  from Dr. Jan or Johannes or John Van  Beuren or Buren, would appear to have no  more in common with the Van Burens of  Kinderhook, to whom the eighth president  of the United States, Martin Van Buren,  belonged, than the relationship arising from  the probable fact that the ancestor of each,  from whom the surname is derived, came  from Buren, a village in the province of  Gelderland, Holland, or was a native of the  place. It is interesting to observe that the  original settler of the Van Burens of Kin-  derhook, unlike the original settler of the  family here dealt with, did not bear the  name of Van Buren. It was not the custom,  when he came to America, in the year 1631.  for Netherlanders to have a family name ex-  cept in rare cases where positions of prom-  inence or some act of more than local impor-  tance, favorable or otherwise, supplied a  name symbolical of the particular cause of  prominence, which would afterwards be  carried down to posterity. The Dutch in-  habitants of New Netherland, after a few  generations, began to adopt family sur-  names, generally taking the name of the  place from which they or their parents emi-  grated in Holland, using the prefix 'Van'  which is Dutch for the words 'of' or  'from'. Thus it was, no doubt, with the  second generation of the Van Buren family  of Kinderhook, the head of which was Cor-  nells Maessen ; Maes or Maas being the  Christian name of his father, the suffix 'sen'  or 'se' signifying son.   This manner of using a substitute for the     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     IZ     patronymic or surname was then in vogue  among the Dutch and some other European  nationalities. To illustrate this custom :  Marten, the eldest son of Cornells Maessen,  made his will in 1703, written in Dutch, in  which his name was signed 'Maren Cor-  nelissen Van Beuren,' meaning 'Martin son  of Cornells from Buren.'   The Van Beuren or Van Buren family  descended from Dr. Jan Van Beuren has  been chiefly notable for furnishing the city  and state of New York with a number of  physicians of eminence, among them the late  William H. Van Buren. The arms and  crest of the family are described herald-  ically: Parti: Au i d'or au levrier rampant  et contourne de gueules; au 2 de gueules a  deux fasces bretesse et contre-bretesse d'or.  Cimier: le levrier rampant, entre un vol de  gueules et d'or.   (I) Dr. Jan or Johannes or John Van  Beuren, the original settler in America of  the Van Buren family here dealt with, is  said to have been born about 1678 at Am-  sterdam, Holland, and died at New York in  1757. He was a graduate of the University  of Leyden, and came to New York in 1700.  About 1724 he removed with his family from  New York to Flatbush, Long Island, but in  1729 he returned to New York, where he  probably continued to reside until his  death. He was one of the principal physi-  cians in the citv. He married in 1707,  Maria Meyer or Myers, a lady who was re-  lated to the old and prominent familv of  Van Home. Through this alliance the Van  Burens are related to the McEvers, Bay-  ards, and other noted families. Children :  I. Pieter, born at New York, September 18,  1709, died young. 2. Christina, baptized  March 2. 171 1, died young. 3. and 4. Pieter  and Maria, twins, baptized January 21, 17J3.  5. Michael, baptized January 26, 1715, died  young. 6. and 7.

Dr. Hendrick, born at  Flatbush, married (first) at Flatbush, No-  vember 28, 1747, Joanna, daughter of Jo-  hannes Albertise, of Bushwick. Long Island,,  and (second) Catryntie Van Voorhees, by  whom he had a son Johannes, baptized at  Flatbush, July 21, 1754, and probably  others.   (II) Beekman \'an Buren, son of Dr. Jan  and Maria (Meyer) Van Beuren, was born at  New York, baptized November 5. 1732, and  died in 1810. Adopting the profession of  his father, he settled in New York where  he was engaged in the practice of physic  until the beginning of the revolutionary war.  Dr. Francis says that 'strong opposition  was met in those days to the adoption of  inoculation for the small pox, as pursued by  Dr. Van Buren in the old Alms House, prior  to 1770.' This is evidence that he was  abreast of the science of the day and that  his reputation, which was great, stood on  sure ground. He married (first) April 12,  1754, Hyltje, daughter of William and Mar-  garet (Roosevelt) De Peyster ; (second) De-  cember 25, 1756, Elizabert, daughter of Wil-  liam and Maria (Van Zindt) Gilbert ; and  (third) Angenieze Vrelandt.

He  was a well known merchant of New York.  He married Anne Dash. Children: John        74     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Dash, mentioned below; Frank, Charles,  George, William, Daniel, Ann Maria, Mich-  ael.   (IV) Colonel John Dash Van Buren, eld-  est son of Michael and Anne (Dash) Van  Buren, was born at New York, March i8,  1811, died in 1885. He was graduated at  Columbia College in 1829, and studied law  in the office of Hugh Maxwell. He aban-  doned the law for commerce and became a  partner in the well known shipping house of  Aymar & Company, with which he was as-  sociated until about 1850, when he retired  to a farm at New Windsor, in Orange coun-  ty. He became engaged in politics as a  member of the Democratic party, was a  member of the assembly in 1863 and held  other positions. He derived his title of colo-  nel from having been appointed paymaster  of the state troops with that rank by Gover-  nor Seymour. Later Governor Hoffman  made him his private secretary and he  moved to Albany and from there to New-  burg. New York, where he died. He was  warden and vestryman for years of St.  Thomas' Episcopal Church of New W^indsor.  He was also a member of the St. Nicholas  Society of New York City.   He married, March 30, 1836.

The familv from which Mr.  WARREN Charles Elliot Warren, the   subject of this sketch, is de-  scended, originally settled in Massachusetts  (Richard Warren, of the 'Mayflower,'' Ply-  mouth, 1620, and John Warren of the 'Ara-  bella,' with Governor Winthrop, with the  fleet of Sir Richard Saltonstall, Salem. June  30. 1630, settled in Watertown), the Ameri-  can immigrants being lineal descendants of     the de Warrennes, of Warren and Surrey,  England, A. D. 1083.   The surname is derived from Carenne or  Vareene, a small river in the old county of  Calais or Caux, in Normandy, which gave  its name to the neighboring commune, and is  only a few miles distant from Dieppe.  There is at present a village called Caronne  in the same district, and it is here that the  origin of the family has been fixed by his-  torians. On the west side of the river Ca-  ronne was the ancient baronial seat of the  de Warrennes, and some of the ruins were  standing as late as 1832. The surname has  assumed different forms from time to time  — Caroyn, Waroyn, Waryn, Warin, War-  ing, Warynge, Waryng and Warren, the  most common. The ancestor of perhaps all  English, Scotch and Irish Warrens was  William de Warrenne, who came to Eng-  land with William the Conqueror and was  related to him both by marriage and con-  sanguinity. He had a considerable com-  mand at the battle of Hastings, and on ac-  count of his valor and fidelity obtained im-  mense grants of land from the Conqueror.  He held estates in Shropshire, Essex, Suf-  folk, Oxford, Hants, Cambridge, Bucks,  Huntingdon, Bedford, Norfolk, Lincoln and  York counties, amounting in all, according  to Hume, to three hundred lordships. He  became the first Earl of Warren and Surrey.  His wife Gundrede, daughter of William the  Conqueror, and a descendant of Charle-  mange, died May 27, 1085, and was buried  in the chapter house of the Priory of Lewes,  county Sussex. Her tombstone is still in  existence. The Earl died June 24, 1088.  His epitaph has been preserved, though the  tombstone is lost or destroyed. In 1845  the cofifers containing the bones of the earl  and his countess were disinterred and are  now in the Church of St. John the Baptist,  Southover.   The history of the Warren family has  been written and is exceeded in interest and  antiquity by none in England. In the 'New  England Genealogical Register,' published  1910, the English ancestry of the immigrant,  John Warren, has been proven by means of  records and wills to be different from that  which has been given before. He came from  Nayland. as did other early settlers in Water-  town, and his ancestors lived in Wiston, or     76     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Wissington, Nayland, and Stoke-Nayland,  three adjoining parishes in Suffolk on the  Essex border.

She was buried November 25, 1567,  and he probably married (third) January 30,  1568-69, Margaret Firmety, at Great   Horkeslcy. She was widow of Cole,   and was buried April 19, 1576.

Avery:  'The saddest note of all, told of the passing  away of our good soul of many, many  years' intimacy, George William Warren :  'The vast blue of heaven does not contain  a better or more Christian spirit; a dearer  fellow on earth did not exist, or a more  noble, or a more lovable. He was a real  friend in word and deed, not alone to me,  but to many another struggler in art. Peace  to his ashes, and quiet and sweet rest to his  clean soul. His own sunny nattire bore him  through many a part of care and sorrow.  All now is over, and I hope he is being     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     79     soothed with the most heavenly of celestial  music' '   He wrote hymns that have become fa-  miliar and cherished by church-goers of  every name and kind. His 'Anthems-Spe-  cial Services' are in very general use. His  'Children's Carols' have gladdened the  hearts of hundreds of thousands, many of  whom, now men and women, recall them as  they think of the happiest associations of  their childhood. Bishop Potter said of him,  that his work in influencing individual souls  and leading them on to a higher life and its  fruition would compare favorably with that  of the most efificient clergyman. The Presi-  dent of Columbia University remembers  him 'with gratitude, and blesses God for  his memory.'   Children: Richard Henry, born Septem-  ber 17, 1859; George, born May 11, 1S61,  died Novembers 9, 1862; Charles Elliot,  above referred to : Frank Chickering, born  April 6, 1866: Alfred Starkey, born April  23, 1867: died September 18, 1868; Mary  Elizabeth, born September 21, 1871, died  March 4, 1906.   The mother of Mr. Charles Elliot  \\'arren was Mary Eliza Pease, the eldest  child of Richard H. Pease. The Pease fam-  ily was of English origin, although it is said  that they were originally from Germany,  moving to England soon after the Conquest.  Robert Pease, the American progenitor of  the family, came from Ipswich, England, in  1^)34, and went to Salem, Massachusetts,  where he died in 1644. His son, John, who  was born in England about 1630, and mar-  ried Mary Goodell, daughter of Robert  Goodell of Salem, lived in Salem and Enfield,  Connecticut, being a freeman in 1668, and  dying in i68g.

In 1825 he removed to Hart-  ford, in 1829 to Albany, New York, and then  to Brooklyn, where he died in 1864. His  wife was Mary Ives, daughter of Joseph  Ives of New Haven. He was the grand-  father of Mary Eliza Pease, and the great-  grandfather on the maternal side of Mr.  Warren. Richard Henry Pease, the ma-  ternal grandfather of Mr. Warren, was born  in Norfolk, Connecticut, in 1813. His early  life was spent in Albany, but he afterwards  removed to New York, where he was en-  gaged in the engraving and publishing busi-  ness. His wife was Mary E. Dawes, whom  he married in Philadelphia in 1833.   Mary Ives, the great-grandmother of Mr.  Warren, was a daughter of Joseph Ives and  his wife Mary Sherman, and Mary Sherman  was a daughter of the Rev. Josiah Sherman,  the line of ancestry thus going back to one  of the most famous colonial families. Rev.  Josiah Sherman was the youngest son of  William Sherman, of Stoughton, Massachu-  setts, and his wife Mehitable Wellington,  of Watertown, Massachusetts, and his' eld-  est brother was the famous Roger Sher-  man, signer of the Declaration of Independ-  ence. Rev. Josiah Sherman was born in  Woodbury, Connecticut, in 1734, and died  in 1769. Graduating from Princeton Col-  lege in 1754, he received the degree of A, M.  from Harvard College in 1758, and from  Yale College in 1765. He was' an able  writer and brilliant orator, and labored un-  ceasingly with voice and pen in support of  the American revolution. During the active  hostilities of that period he served as cap-  tain and chaplain of the Seventh Regiment  of the Connecticut Line.

The Aspinwalls or As-  ASPINWALL pinalls have been for  several centuries located  in the county of Lancaster, England. There  is no clear indication of the origin of the  family. The name Aspinwall, like many  others, has undergone several changes, and  as near as can be ascertained has arrived  at its present form through various grada-  tions, from Aspenhalgh, Aspinhaugh, As-  pinall, Aspinwall, the name originally sig-  nifying an 'Aspen Mead' or an 'Aspen  \'ale.' Toxteth Park, in Lancaster county,  England, was the home of some of the As-  pinwalls of America, according to one au-  thority. It is now a suburb of the city of  Liverpool and had been the property of the  Crown from the time of King John, but in  the year 1604 it was disparked, and came  through purchase into the hands of one  Richard Molyneux. Prior to this time it is  spoken of as 'waste land without inhabi-  tants,' but when it was disparked a number  of persons settled on the land, and began  its cultivation. Among these was one Ed-  ward Aspinwall, no doubt a member of the  Aspinwall family in the immediate vicinity.  He appears to have been the earliest settler  of the name at To.xteth Park, and from va-  rious ciicumstances it is believed that he  was the father of Peter Aspinwall, the im-     82     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     migrant ancestor of the family in America  here dealt with.   It appears that the early inhabitants of  Toxteth Park were Puritans in their lean-  ings, and in 1611, Richard Mather, after-  wards minister at Dorchester, Massachu-  setts, at the age of fifteen years, was called  there to take charge of the school. He lived  while at Toxteth in the family of Edward  Aspinwall, and while there became con-  verted, which, as he expresses it, 'was oc-  casioned by observing a difference between  his own walk, and the most exact, watch-  ful, faithful, and prayerful conversation of  some of the family of the learned and pious  Mr. Edward Aspinwall of Toxteth, where  he sojourned.' These Puritans at Toxteth  built a chapel, the first one connected with  the 'dissenters' in the neighborhood of  Liverpool. The building then erected is not  now in existence, but upon its site is the  present church, which was built something  more than a hundred years ago, preserving  some of its features, while the old burying  ground remains undisturbed. In this  clmrch. in the main aisle, on the stone cov-  ering of a vault is a brass plate bearing the  following inscription : 'Edward Aspinwall  of Toxteth Park, Esquire, Departed this life  in March the 20th, A.D. 1656.' Many of  these Puritans in 1630 and the following  years emigrated to America and particu-  larly to New England.   To those interested in coat armor it may  be said that there appears in the various  works on heraldry several different coats-  of-arms. 'Burke's General Armory' gives  to the Aspinwalls of Lancaster county,  England, two different ones, the first, 'Or.  a chev. between three griffins' heads erased  sa. Crest — A dcmi griffin's head erased sa.  beaked, legged, and collared or.' The sec-  ond is: 'Ar. an aspen leaf or.' 'Edmon-  son's Heraldry' gives to the Aspinwalls of  Northumberland, 'Gu. — two bars dancette  Or. within a bordure sa.' The motto is  Aefjis fortissima virtus, meaning that vir  tue is the strongest shield. It is believed,  though there is no certain evidence in sup-  port of the theory, that Peter Aspinwall,  the first of the American Aspinwalls here  dealt '.v:th, was a n, ember cf t1ie family of  Lancaster county, England, above referred  to. The tradition exists in the familv and     was recorded at an early date in the eigh-  teenth century by his great-grandson, and  as there is nothing inherently improbable  in the supposition, and much that is in-  herently probable, it may be assumed that  such was the case.   (I) Peter Aspinwall, the immigrant an-  cestor of the Aspinwall family in America  here dealt with, came from England with a  company of others in 1626 qr 1630, and  settled at Dorchester, Massachusetts. Dr.  William Aspinwall, of Brookline, Massa-  chusetts, a great-grandson of Peter Aspin-  wall, wrote an account of the family in  1767, which is in the possession of one of  his descendants. He said: 'Peter Aspin-  wall came from Toxteth Park, near Liver-  pool, Old England, to Dorchester, near Bos-  ton, in New England, in company with the  four thousand who came in the year 1630.'  Aside from this statement that Peter Aspin-  wall came in 1630, we have no knowledge,  and the first mention of him in any records  is in May, 1645, at which time he was made  a freeman (or voter) by the general court,  and was then living at Dorchester, Massa-  chusetts. About this time he was married  to his first wife, for the records of the First  Church of Boston show that 'Also or sister,  Alice Sharp, now ye wife of Peter Aspin-  wall, of Dorchester, had Ires of Recomend  granted unto her to ye church at Dorches-  ter. The 8th day of ye 4th moneth (June)  1645.' Nothing forther than the statement  that he was made a freeman in 1645 ap-  pears in the Dorchester records, and in  1630 he removed to Muddy River, now  known as Brookline, Massachusetts, where  in connection with one Robert Sharp, per-  haps his brother-in-law. he purchased a  farm of one hundred and fifty acres. Upon  this farm Peter Aspinwall, in the year 1660,  built the house which was the family home-  stead for many generations. This house  stood until the year i8qi when it was taken  down, being at the time the oldest house in  the old town of Brookline. It was located  on the present Aspinwall avenue, near St.  Paul's Church. Here Peter Aspinwall lived  and died. He was a farmer and, judging by  the inventory of his estate taken after his  death, which included a tanning outfit, he  probably carried on also a tanning business.  He does not appear to have been very con-     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     83     spicuous in public affairs, but held several  town offices. He was surveyor in 1651-52,  also in 1661-62, and constable in 1667. He  was appointed, April 24, 1676, with two  others, a committee 'for the preventage of  excessive drinkage and disorder in private  houses' and was elected, March 25, 1678,  'to oversee and regulate the ffences about  the common ffield at Muddy River.'   According to Dr. William Aspinwall he  was three times married, but there is some  doubt about the second marriage. He mar-  ried (first) probably early in 1645, Alice  Sharp, who may have been a sister to that  Robert Sharp, in connection with whom he  bought the farm described in the foregoing  deed. He married (third) February 12,  1662, Remember, daughter of Peter and  Edith Palfrey, of Reading, Massachusetts,  Governor John Endicott officiating. She  was baptized at Salem, Massachusetts, Sep-  tember 16, 1638. These are the only mar-  riages of which there is any detailed record.  Children: Samuel, born November 4, 1662;  Peter, Jvme 4, 1664; Nathaniel, June 5, 1666;  Thomas, January 21, 1668; Mehitable, Sep-  tember 14, 1669; Elizabeth, November 21,  1671 ; Eleazar, October 9, 1673; Joseph,  mentioned below, twin of Eleazar; Job, Feb-  ruary 27, 1675, died young; Mary, August  4, 1677; Timothy, April 19, 1682, died of  smallpox while yet a young man, and un-  married.   (H) Joseph, son of Peter and Remember  (Palfrey) Aspinwall, was born at Muddy  River, now Brookline, Massachusetts, Octo-  ber 9. 1673, died in 1743. Before he be-  came of age he went to sea, where he com-  manded a vessel of his own. As early as  the year 1700, probably some time before,  he lived in New York City, and so con-  tinued until 171 1, when he removed to Say-  brook, Connecticut, where he kept a store  and also commanded a sloop out of that  port called the 'Joseph Burthen.' He was  made a freeman of the city of New York, June  6, 1710. On May i, 171 1, he subscribed one  pound, two shillings, towards the finishing  of the steeple of Trinity Church, New York.  In December, 1711, while living at Say-  brook, he was allowed by the Connecticut  assembly the sum of nineteen pounds eleven  shillings and sixpence for the charges of  Captain Crane's funeral. In October, 1712,     he petitioned the Connecticut assembly  praying for an allowance 'for a consider-  able sum in publick bills of credit of this  colony lost by fire some time in winter last  at Wethersfield, where he then sojourned.'  He was burned out at Saybrook, and about  1713-14 he removed to Dedham, Massachu-  setts. In 1714 he was imprisoned for a debt  of one hundred and twenty-eight pounds  four shillings and four pence, due Philip  Hedman of Boston, merchant. His release  was ordered by the court of general ses-  sions at Boston, after he had 'declared upon  his oath what effects were belonging to  him.' How long he lived in Dedham is  not known. His first wife probably died  while he was living there, and he went to  sea again. In 1724, while at Dedham, he  bought eighty-four acres of land in Kill-  ingly, Connecticut, from his brother, Peter,  but he sold it back to him in 1728. There  is no evidence that he ever lived on it. On  December 5, 1729, an attachment was issued  against the estate of Joseph Aspinwall 'late  of Saybrook in our colony of Connecticut,  now residing in Boston, mariner, for six  hundred pounds, to answer to Magdalen  Hickells of Elizabethtown, New Jersey.'  The jury found for the defendant. On Sep-  tember I, 1740, he petitioned the general  court of Massachusetts, renewing his offer  to go as a pilot for the Spanish coasts. Dr.  William Aspinwall, writing in 1767, says:  'He was of middling stature, well propor-  tioned, and very gentee and something  hansome : he was very passionate, very gay,  facetious, good company, and always loose  and exceedingly careless of his own and his  children's affairs.'   He married ('first) in New York City in  1700, Hannah, daughter of Christopher and  Hannah Deane. The license for this mar-  riage was granted on June 6, 1700. He  married (second) a niece of Lord Bello-  mont, governor of the Massachusetts Bay  Colony. This was probably while he lived  at Dedham, and about the time he went to  sea again. He married (third) some five  or six years before his death, at Brookline,  widow of Samuel Smith of that place. She  probably survived him. Children : Joseph ;  John, mentioned below.   (Ill) John, son of Joseph and Hannah  (Deane) Aspinwall, was born in 1705 or     84     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     1706, died July 5, 1774. He settled in Ded-  ham, Massachusetts. He followed the sea  and was captain of a vessel out of New  York. Later he became a merchant and  acquired considerable means, and settled in  Flushing, Long Island. He was an alder-  man of New York, and one of the founders  of the New York Library in 1753. From  1753 to 1760 he was vestryman of Trinity  Church, New York. He married (first)  August 28, 1728, Sarah Sands, of Oyster  Bay, Long Island; (second), at Stamford,  Connecticut, June 5, 1766, Rebecca Smith.  The Nezv York Gazette of December 12,  1765, said: 'Wednesday, departed this life  in her fifty-seventh year Mrs. Sarah Aspin-  wall and was decently interred in the family  vault. Her summons into eternity was ex-  tremely sudden, but she received it with  that fortitude and resignation peculiar to  the Christian character. Her family, friends  and acquaintances, in her death sustained  a very great loss, and can only comfort  themselves under the dispensation by the  evidence of her faith and piety, which she  has left behind her.' Child by first mar-  riage: Hannah. By second marriage: Wil-  liam Smith, Gilbert, John, mentioned below.   (IV) John (2), son of John (i) and Re-  becca (Smith) Aspinwall, was born in New  York City, February 10, 1774, died October  6, 1847. He was a shipping merchant of,  New York. In 1794 he entered into part-  nership with his brother Gilbert, at No. 186  Queen street, under the firm name of Gil-  bert and John Aspinwall. They were im-  porters and jobbers, and owned the ships  they used. They dissolved partnership in  1812, and each then carried on business for  himself. On one occasion during the war  of 1812, while the partnership existed, they  cleared twenty thousand dollars on one trip  of the 'Blooming Rose.' John had the  reputation of being a venturesome and gen-  erous man. He married. November 27, 1803,  Susan Howland, born May 20, 1770, died  December 21, 1852. Children: Margaret  Elizabeth, born September 16. 1804; Emily  Philips, January 20, 1806; William Henry,  December i6, 1807; Mary Rebecca, Decem-  ber 20, 1809; Louisa Edgar, December 28,  181 1, died at Barrytown. New York, Sep-  tember 2, 1871, unmarried ; George Woolsey,     January 10, 1814, died June 19, 1854; John  Lloyd, mentioned below.   (V) John Lloyd, youngest son of John  (2) and Susan (Howland) Aspinwall, was  born in New York. April 5, 1816, died May  6, 1873. at New York. He entered the firm  of Howland & Aspinwall, successors to the  firm of Gilbert and John Aspinwall of New  York, at the age of sixteen, rose gradually  in the firm, and on the death of his father  became a partner. He continued in the firm  until 1856 when he retired from active life.  In i860 he purchased a large estate at  Barrytown, Dutchess county, New York,  where he passed the life of a country gen-  tleman. He was an Episcopalian, and aided  in founding St. Stephen's College. Annan-  dale, Dutchess county, New York, of which  he was treasurer until his death. He  married Jane Moore, daughter of George  and Catherine D. (Israel) Breck, residents  of Bristol. Pennsylvania. Children : Will-  iam, born 1848. died 1868; John, mentioned  below; Emily Woolsey, born 1862, died  1874; Helen Lloyd, born December 23.  1863.   (VI) John (3), second son of John Lloyd  and Jane Moore (Breck) Aspinwall, was  born October 15, 1858, at Paris, France.  He was educated in private schools and in  St. Stephen's College, .^Xnnandalc, New  York, and graduated with degree of M.E.  in the class of 1881, from Stevens Institute  of Technology, Hoboken, New Jersey, and  is now a trustee of this institute. Later he  became a lecturer on chemistry at St.  Stephen's College, Annandale, from which he  received degree of M. A., and was made a  trustee of this college. In 1899 '^^ founded the  Fabrikoid Company of New York, and now in  Newburg, of which he was president until  it was absorbed by the Dupont Powder  Company in 1910. He was president of the  Powelton Club, 1910-11-12; member of the  City Club, of Newburg; member of the New  York Yacht Club ; president of the Camera  Club of New York in 1002: first president  of the Newburg Tuberculosis Sanatorium ;  president of New York Microscopical So-  ciety, 1899-1900; editor of Nezv York  Microscopical Journal, 1899-1902.

He married (first) in 1882  Laura Presbey Elderkin, died in 1883 ;     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     85     (second) September 29, 1885, Julia W.  Wilson. Child, Bessie Reid, married, No-  vember 24, 1909, Lieutenant Hayden W.  Wagner, Third United States Cavalry, and  they are the parents of a son, John Aspin-  wall Wagner, born February 23, 1912.     This old Dutch name  WESTERVELT is derived from a lo-  cality in Holland,   meaning the 'western field,' and was   brought to America in 1662.   (I) In the year 1662, Lubbert Lubbert-  sen Van Westervelt and Gessie Roelofs Van  Houten, his wife, and six children, as immi-  grants, came from Rleppel, in the province  of Drenthe, in Holland, reaching New Am-  sterdam about May ist. They crossed in  the Dutch West Indies ship 'Faith.' In  December, 1662, they settled in Flatbush,  where he purchased a farm. Their children  were : Lubbert, Roelof, John, Juriaen, Mar-  gretie, and Mary. It is probable that Lub-  bert Lubbertsen had a second wife, as the  records of the Dutch church in New York  show the baptism on March 2, 1681, of  Aeltie, daughter of Lubbert Lubbertsen and  Hilletie Paulus.   (II) Roelof, second son of Lubbert Lub-  bertsen Van Westervelt, married Ursulina  Steinerts, probably from Thymens, as her  name appears in the records of the first  Dutch church of New York as Ursulina  Thymens. They had children : Jannetie,  born 1686; Kasporus, mentioned below;  Johannes, 1695; Ariantie. 1699; Maritie,  1704; Annatie, 1707.

(VII) Sylvester, eldest child of James  and Hannah (Teneyck) Westervelt, was  born March 9, 1821, at Ramapo, died Jan-  uary 24, 1901, in Newark, New Jersey. He  learned the trade of carriage builder in that  town, and engaged in business of his own  at Ramapo, removing to Haverstraw, New  York, and subsequently to Newark, New  Jersey. In 1854 he took charge of the  Phoenix Carriage Works at Stamford, Con-  necticut, and in i860 returned to Newark,  where he was superintendent of a wheel  factory. He was a Republican in political  principles. He married (first) December 31,  1844, Margaret Blauvelt, born April 2, 1825,  in Ramapo, Rockland county.

He attended the public schools in Spring  Valley and Stamford, Connecticut, also at  Newark, New Jersey, and again at Spring  \'alley. Entering the Normal College at  Albany, New York, he was graduated in  1867. and engaged in teaching in the Union  Academy at Belleville, New York. Later  he was a teacher in the Union Hall Acad-  emy at Jamaica, Long Island, and follow-  ing this in the Polytechnic Institute in  Brooklyn, New York. Afterward he taught  in the .Ashland public school of East Orange.  New Jersey, and the public school of Plain-  field, New Jersey.

With his family Mr.  Westervelt affiliated with the Dutch Re-  formed church of West New Hempstead  (known as the Brick Church), in the town of  Ramapo. He is an earnest supporter of  Republican principles, but takes no part in  fjractical politics, and has never l)een a can-  didate for official position.

(VIII) Margaret, second daughter of Jo-  seph C. and Rebecca (Ramsen) Blauvelt.  and twin of Isaac R., became the wife of  Svlvester Westervelt, of Ramapo (see  Westervelt VII).     Joline is a surname of French  JOLINE or Huguenot origin. Charles   W. Baird says in his work,  'Huguenot Emigration to America':  'Along the Gironde on the south shore of  Saintonge (France') are the seaport towns  and villages of Royan, Meschers, Saint     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     87     Palais, and Saint Georges. Two of the ref-  ugees in New York, Daniel Lambert and  Andre Jolin, were natives of Saint Palais.'  And he adds: 'Andre Jolin obtained deniza-  tion in New York August 6, 1686, and was  naturalized April 15, 1693. He was a mem-  ber of the French Church, New York in  1688. His wife was Madeileine Poupin. A  family Bible in the possession of T. S.  Drake, Esq., of New Rochelle, New York,  contains the name of Guis Jolin. Guy J|olin,  natif de Vaux, paroisse de Saint Palais en  Saintonge, was one of the refugees in Bris-  tol, England, in the latter part of the eigh-  teenth century.' From the Andre Jolin,  above mentioned, the American family of  the name would appear to be descended.   (I) John Joline, first traceable ancestor  of the branch of the Joline family here  dealt with, lived at Princeton, New Jersey,  in the latter part of the eighteenth century.  The oldest house in which he lived was re-  cently standing on the farm of which it was  the homestead and not far north of the  William Gulick residence, later belonging to  Alexander Gulick, between Princeton and  Kingston. John had a brother named An-  thony who was prominent in politics. He  married but there is no available record of  the name of his wife. Child, John, men-  tioned below.   (H) John (2), son of John (i) Joline,  was born in Princeton, New Jersey, about  1769, died in the same locality in 1839. He  was one of the most notable landlords or  innkeepers of Princeton. He had kept Hudi-  bras House from the year 1810 to the year  1812 and took charge of the Nassau Hotel  and kept it from 1812 to the year 1836. He  was widely celebrated as a genial host who  could tell a good story and could sing a  good song. He kept good horses, set a  great table, and was a favorite with the  students of the university, giving them good  suppers and clandestine sleigh rides. The  public travelling through Princeton grew  into a large business while John Joline kept  the Nassau House. Children : William,  graduated with first honors from Princeton  University; James van Dyke, graduated  from Princeton ; Charles Oliver, mentioned  below; Mary, married Ashbell Green, son of  Ashbell Green, the president of the college  and a lawyer; Cornelia, married a Mr. Maur-     ice, of Sing Sing, New York; Catherine,  married the Rev. Mr. Billings, of Virginia.  (HI) Colonel Charles Oliver Joline, third  son of John (2) Joline, of Princeton, was  born at Princeton about 1823. He served  with distinction in both the Mexican and the  civil wars and attained the rank of colonel.  He married, in 1848, Mary Evelyn, third  child of Adrian Kissam HofTman, M. D.,  and Jane Ann (Thompson) Hoffman, a sis-  ter of the late John T. Hoffman, governor  of New York : Children : Adrian Hoffman,  mentioned below; Catherine H., born De-  cember II, 1853, married the Rev. James O.  Drumm, rector of St. Andrew's Church,  Watervliet, West Troy, New York ; Cor-  nelia Maurice, born at Sing Sing, October,   1857-   ( IV ) Adrian Hoffman, eldest son of Colonel  Charles Oliver and Mary Evelyn (Hoffman)  Joline, was born at Sing Sing, New York,  June 30, 1850, died October 15, 1912. He  prepared for college at the Mount Pleasant  Academy, Sing Sing, New York, and under  the private tuition of the Rev. Dr. James I.  Helm. In 1863 he was clerk of the military  commission at Norfolk, Virginia, convened  for the trial of Dr. Wright for the murder  of Lieutenant Sanborn, one of the first offi-  cers of colored troops. In 1864 he was also  clerk of the military commission that sat at  Fort Lafayette for the trial of prisoners. He  was graduated from Princeton with the de-  gree of A. B. in 1870 and with the degree of  A. M. in 1873. He attended also the Co-  lumbia Law School and attained the degree  of LL.D. of Princeton. He was admitted  to the bar in May, 1872, and shortly after  entered the law firm of Brown. Hall & Van-  derpoel. Next he became a member of But-  ler. Stillman & Hubbard, continuing from  1881 to 1896; then of the firm of Butler,  Notman, Joline & Mynderse, continuing  from 1896 to 1905, and then of the firm of  Joline, Larkin & Rathbone, which he helped  to form. Early in his career he devoted  particular attention to railway litigation and  to questions pertaining to trusts, mort-  gages and reorganizations. He engaged in  many important litigations and legal con-  troversies. At the time of his death he was  a director of the Albany and Susquehanna  railroad, the American and Foreign Marine  Insurance Company, the Bridge Operating     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Company, the Chatham and Phoenix  National Bank, the National Surety  Company, and the United Traction and  Electric Company, and vice-president of the  New Orleans Warehouse Company. He  was chairman of the board of directors and  president of the Missouri, Kansas, and  Texas Railway Company from 1906 to 1909,  and receiver of the New York City Rail-  way Company and Metropolitan Street Rail-  way Company in 1907. For years Mr. Jo-  line was engaged in the legal work of the  large railroad interests. Mr. Joline was  also an author of considerable reputation,  the following being among his productions:  'Meditations of an Autograph Collector,'  1902; 'Diversions of a Book Lover,' 1903,  'The Book Collector,' 1904; 'The Auto-  graph Hunter,' 1906; and 'At the Library  Table.' He was a liberal contributor to the  columns of The Collector, a magazine for  autograph and historical collectors, for  many years. 'The American Political  Biography,' which ran for several years,  was written by him. His final contribution  was the series of six articles, 'Concerning  Autographs.' He had a large autograph  collection, which was very valuable. It con-  tained all the usual American sets, and was  especially rich in British literary. He was  an earnest collector in many lines for about  a quarter of a century, and having large  means he secured great numbers of fine  things. By his essays on autograph collect-  ing he did much to dignify this intellectual  pursuit, and he was always interested in be-  ginners and helped start many a young col-  lector. He was a member of the American  Bar Association, the New York State Bar  Association, the Association of the Bar of  the City of New York, the New York, New  Jersey, Virginia and American Historical  societies. He was also a member of the  Century, Grolier, University, Princeton, St.  Elmo. City. Barnard, Morristown. Down  Town, Chicago, Caxton, and Dofobs clubs.  He married, in 1876, Mary E., daughter of  the Hon. Francis Larkin, the distinguished  leader of the Westchester bar,   (The Hoffman Line.)  This family is of Swedish origin though  the name is distinguished in Dutch and Ger-  man literature. It is not improbable that     the Dutch and the German families are of '  Swedish extraction and travelled originally  from Sweden, as in the time of Gustavus  Adolphus in the seventeenth century large  numbers of Scandinavians removed to Hol-  land and Germany. The name in the Scan-  dinavian dialect seems to have been at first  Hoppman, signifying in Swedish the same  as Hoffman in Dutch, namely, 'Man of  Hope.' Arthur on 'Family Names' says:  'Hoffman : Dutch from Hoofdman, a captain,  or director, or head or chief man. Also  Hofman, from Hof, a court, the man of the  court.' There were several individuals of  the name of Hofifman who arrived in some  of the early migrations of the Swedes to  Delaware, who were included among those  transferred by Governor Stuyvesant (on his  conquest of New Sweden to prevent a revo-  lution among them in favor of Queen Chris-  tina of Sweden) to the city of Amsterdam  where they commingled Swedish blood with  the Dutch population of the city in which  the Dutch predominated.   (I) Martin Hermanzen Hoffman, son of  Hermann Hofifman, was born in 1625 at  Revel (on the Gulf of Finland, at that period  belonging to Sweden but now part of the  Russian Empire, having been conquered by  Peter the Great in 1710). He is said to have  been Ritmaster in the army of Gustavus  Adolphus of Sweden. It is probable that he  was living prior to the emigration to Amer-  ica at Ezen, Ostenbenzie, Holland, for Mar-  tin Hoffman was authorized by his brother-  in-law, Tjerck Claesen de Witte (the ances-  tor of the De Witte family of New York),  to recover some property for him at Ezen,  Holland. Martin emigrated to America  about 1657. He settled at Esopus (Kings-  ton), where in 1658 he joined with the other  residents in the vicinity (against the orders  of Ensign Smith who was in command of  the garrison there) in an attack on the In-  dians. He removed to New Amsterdam  (New York) where, according to the direc-  tory of the city published in 1661, he was  living in De I lure straat (Broadway) in  that year and was a large taxpayer and an  extensive auctioneer. He continued for  some time here and here at least two of his  children were born, following the contract-  ing of two marriages. From New Amster-  dam he removed to Albany, then known as     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     89     Fort Orange, where in 1672 he was Hving  in the house conveyed to him in that year  and which, with the lot on which it stood,  is referred to as a boundary in other deeds.  In December, 1676, he sold this property to  Cornelius Cornelise Van de Hoeve and  bought another house and lot in Fort  Orange, where he was living and following  the occupation of a saddler in 1678. Short-  ly afterwards he removed to Ulster county,  New York, and settled at Kingstowne. 'Mar-  tin Hoffman' received a grant from the  Crown of land in the 'Towne of Kingstowne,'  Ulster county, which is recorded in the  county clerk's office at Kingston under date  February 6, 1688. In the roll of names and  surnames of those having taken the oath of  allegiance in the county of Ulster by order  of the government, September i, 1689, are  found the names of Martin Hofifman, Ter-  rick Claes De Witt and Anthony Crispell.  Martin Hoffman married (first) March 3,  1663, Lysbeth Hermans, by whom he had no  issue; (second) May 16, 1664, Emmerentje  Claesen de Witte. Children: Annetje, born  1665, married Hendrick Pruyn ; Marretje,  1666; Zacharias, married Hester Bruyn ;  Nicolas, mentioned below; Taatje, married  Everardus Bogardus.   (II) Nicolas, eldest son of Martin Her-  manzen and Emmerentje C. (De Witte)  Hoffman, was born at Kingstowne, Ulster  county. New York, about 1680. He settled  in Esopus (now Kingston) and the stone  mansion erected by him on the corner of  North Front and Green streets, once used as  a fort, is still standing and is occupied by  one of his descendants. Nicolas made ex-  tensive purchases of property, acquiring large  estates in both Ulster and Dutchess counties.  He obtained grants of land near Kingstowne  from the trustees in 171 3 and 1721, and made  purchases of property from Gerret Aertson in  1718 and from John Rutson in 1720. On  September 11, 1720, a conveyance was exe-  cuted from Colonel Peter Schuyler to Cap-  tain Nicolas Hofifman of 'land in Dutchess  County going by the name of Mastenbrock,  bounded southerly by the land of Barent  Van Benthuysen, easterly and northerly by  the manor of Livingston, and westerly by  the Hudson river.' The conveyance is the  first record we have of the possession of  property in Dutchess county by the Hoff-     man family, who afterwards became such  extensive landowners in that county. Nico-  las Hoffman's name appeared first in the  list of freeholders of the towne of Kingstowne  in 1728 and in the census of Dutchess coun-  ty taken in 1740 he and his son Martinus  Hoffman are named as freeholders. Among  the English manuscripts in the office of the  secretary of state at Albany is a muster roll  of Captain Nicolas Hoft'man's company in  Captain Jacob Rutsen's regiment, Ulster  county, November 21, 1715. This military  organization was in accordance with the act  entitled 'An Act for the Better Security  and Defence of this Province and the Set-  tling of the Militia,' passed by the council  held at Fort Orange in New York, July i,  1715. Captain Nicolas Hoffman command-  ed a company (Second) of the Ulster county  regiment at Kingstowne in 1717, his commis-  sion being signed by General Hunt, dated  October 3, 1717. Nicolas Hoffman was a  trustee of the corporation at Kingstowne in  1712, 1720, 1726, and treasurer of Kingstowne  in 1737. He was a deacon of the Reformed  Dutch church of Kingstowne and in this ca-  pacity signed the petition for the charter of  this church which was obtained from  George I., November 17, 1719.   He married, January, 1705, Jannetje On-  atio Crispell, born in Horley, February,  1686, daughter of Antonie Crispell, a Hu-  guenot, who settled in that region and was  one of the patentees of New Paltz, Ulster  county, New York. Children : Martinus,  mentioned below; Antje, born 1709; An-  thony, 171 1, married Catherine Van Gaas-  bech ; Zacharias, 1713, married (first) Hel-  ena Van Wyck, and (second) Letitia (Brick-  erhoff) Van Wyck; Petrus, baptized at  Kingstowne, December 2, 1716, died young;  Hendrick, baptized at Kingstowne, June 7,  1719. died young; Anaatjen, baptized at  Kingstowne, December 3, 1721, died young;  Maria, 1724, married John Ten Broeck ;  Peter. 1727, married Catharine Van Alstyne.   (Ill) Martinus, son of Nicolas and Jan-  netje (Crispell) Hoffman, was born at  Kingstowne, Ulster county. New York, Feb-  ruary 6, 1706-07. He removed from the  neighborhood of Kingstowne to Dutchess  county and settled, as did several of his  brothers, near Red Hook, on the Hudson  and east of it, on land purchased by his fa-     90     SOUTHERN NEW ^'OKK     ther. Holgate says: 'It is from Martinus  Hoffman and his brothers that the branch of  the family in New York descends. This  branch has become affluent and highly dis-  tinguished for literary attainments.' Mar-  tinus became occupied in the care of his  property, farming and cultivating it and es-  tablished, under his father, the celebrated  grist mill which gave the name to the neigh-  borhood of 'Hoffman's Mills.' He was also  a large purchaser of real estate. February  IQ, 1755, he received for the sum of nine-  teen hundred pounds a conveyance of land  in Dutchess county. For many years he  was colonel of the regiment stationed at  Dutchess county and the state archives at  Albany contain frequent references to him.  The public records show that in 1748 Mar-  tinus Hoffman was endeavoring to concili-  ate the Indians in Dutchess county, and  April 15, 1767, a petition was presented to  the government by the native Indians claim-  ing lands 'from a place called Waunaukar-  mackack, a little south of where Colonel  Hoffman now lives and east of the Hud-  son.' Martinus was appointed justice of  the peace for Dutchess county in 1750. In  1755 when an official list of negro slaves 'in  Zaciiarias Hoffman's district,' Dutchess  county, was made, Colonel Martinus Hoff-  man owned ten slaves, the largest number  held by any one person in Rhinebeck pre-  cinct, and 'he was a man of large property  and influence.' He was one of the original  members of the old Red Church near Mad-  aim, the ground for which was given I)y his  brother Zacharias.   He married (first) in the Reformed Dutch  church of New York, October 19, 1733,  Tryntje (Catharine), born May 30, 1712,  died March 31, 1765, daughter of Robert and  Cornelia (Roosc) Benson ; (second) .'\lida,  born 1715, widow of Henry Hemsen, of  Harlem, New York. Children by first mar-  riage: Cornelia, born 1734, married Isaac  Roosevelt; Nicholas, born 1736, married  Sarah Ogden ; Robert, 1737, married Sarah  Van Alstyne ; Anthony, 173Q, married Mary  Rutgers; Annaatje, 1741, died young; Ma-  ria, 1743, married Rev. Dr. Archibald Laid-  lie; Harmanus, 1745, married (first) Catha-  rine Douw, (second) Cornelia Vrcdenburgh,  (third) Catharine Verplanck ; Martin, 1747,  married Margaret Bayard; Zacharias, 1749,     married Jane Hoffman; child by second  marriage; Philip Livingston, mentioned be-  low.   (IV) Philip Livingston, son of Martinus  and Alida (Hemsen) Hoffman, was born in  New York, September 20, 1767, died No-  vember 25, 1807. He was a lawyer and  lived in Johnstown, New York. He mar-  ried, November 18, 1787, Helene, born May  16, 1769, only daughter of Benjamin and  Catherine (Rutgers) Kissam. Children:  Catherine Ann, born 1788, married Daniel  Coolidge ; Alida, born April 26, 1790; Rich-  ard Kissam, born 1791, married Jane Ben-  son; Philip Livingston, born February,  1793; Helene, born November 25, 1794;  Adrian Kissam, mentioned below ; Henry  H., July 15, 1801 ; Charles Ogden, December  30, 1807.   (V) Dr. Adrian Kissam Hoffman, son of  Philip Livingston and Helene (Kissam)  Hoffman, was born March 26, 1797, died  May 6, 1871. He was a physician and re-  sided at Sing Sing, New York. He married,  February 26, 1825, Jane Ann, born April 20,  1801, died February ir, 1876, daughter of  the Hon. Dr. John Thompson, of Saratoga  county. New York, and Mary (Lyell)  Thompson. Children: Cornelia, born 1825,  married Alfred Buckhont; John Thompson,  born 1828. married Ella Starkweather;  Mary Evelyn, mentioned below; Emma  Kissam. born 1835. married the Rev. Minot  M. Wells; Catherine Coolidge, born 1839.  married (first) Charles C. Hyatt, (second)  General W. H. Morris.   (VI) Mary Evelyn, daughter of Dr. Adri-  an Kissam and Jane Ann (Thompson) Hoff-  man, was born in 1830. She married, in  1848. Colonel Charles Oliver Joline (see  Joline III).     Regarding the surname. Barns  BARNS or Barnes, Lower says that it   is in origin the same as Bern-  crs. .\ccording to the Domesday Book of  England. Hugh dc Bcrners, as a tenant in  chief held Eversdan. county Cambridge,  England. The Itin. Norm, mentions si.x lo-  calities called Bernieres in different parts  of Normandy, but which of them, if any, is  the cradle of the race is unknown. A differ-  ent origin is assigned in the Archaeological  Journal, which says : 'O. Fr. bernier, a     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     91     vassal who paid berenage, a feudal due for  the support of the lord's hounds.' The  name may in other cases be derived from  residence near a monastic or manorial barn.  There are several Barns families in the  United States that are not traceable to a  common origin, and it would be impossible  to find a common origin for them in Eng-  land, from which presumably most of them  came. The Barns of the East Hampton  family are certainly descended from Wil-  liam Barnes, who died December i, 1699,  and Elizabeth, his wife. But the parentage  of William has not been ascertained with  absolute certainty. Tradition says that he  was the son of Charles and Mary Barnes,  who have been traced at East Hampton,  Long Island, in the period 1655-63. All ef-  forts to find the ancestry of W'illiam in any  part of New England or Old England have  failed, and it is certain that he was not de-  scended from any of the other early Barnes  settled on Long Island; so that, if he was  not a son of Charles, we know nothing of  his ancestry.   (I) Charles Barnes, the supposed progeni-  tor of the Barnes family of East Hampton,  Long Island, was born at Eastwinch, Nor-  folkshire, England, about 1615, came to  America and is supposed to have returned  to England and died there. He was school-  master at East Hampton, Long Island, be-  tween 1655 and 1663. Under date of July  6, 1655, an account is given of his ejecting  Daniel Fairfield from the school-house for  unbecoming language and conduct. In the  same year he entered an earmark for his  cattle. On September 15, 1657, he obtained  judgment against John Mulford, Thomas  Baker and John Hand, three pounds sterling  each for slander. On October 6. 1657, at the  general court a thirteen acre lot, without  meadow, was awarded to him. In 1663 he  executed a power of attorney to his wife.  On November 18. 1663, at Southampton,  Long Island, Captain Scott asked one hun-  dred pounds sterling from Charles Barns for  slander. Defendant made acknowledgment  and was forgiven but must pay costs. In  the same year, on complaint of Mr. Odell,  Charles Barns was held in ten pounds for  the December court. He appears to have  been a man of considerable spirit, adding  not a little to the animation of the small     community in which he was a prominent fig-  ure. He married a woman, whose first  name was Mary. Children: William, men-  tioned below ; Amy, born in East Hampton,  Long Island.   (II) William Barns, the supposed son of  Charles and Mary Barnes or Barns, was  born probably in England, and died at East  Hampton, Long Island, December i, 1699.  Several tracts of land in East Hampton,  Long Island, were allotted to him in 1653.  He entered earmarks for his cattle at a date  not clearly indicated. The town meeting at  Southampton in 1672 granted unto William  Barns and John Rose should have ten acres  of land at Sagabonack, adjoining the house  lot of William Barns, instead of the land  which Rose was to have taken up at the  Mill Stone brook. On April 2, 1681 — and it  seems in pursuance of the foregoing- — John  Lupton received land from John Rose upon  the account of William Barns.   At East Hampton, April 4, 1699, a high-  way is mentioned as 'flanking to the west-  ward side of William Barns Lot.' On April  16 land was assigned to William Barns and  his brothers, except Thomas (these were  the children of William). On May 7, 1708,  land was drawn by the widow of William  Barns. On April 4, 1710, there was a vote  in the town meeting and action thereupon.  May 13, 1710, by which land was allotted to  the heirs of William Barns. About the  same time in an account of each man's right  of commonage the heirs of William Barns,  deceased, were credited with four acres, two  roods. Of the children of William Barns,  Thomas is distinctly named the eldest son.  The order of their birth has not been ascer-  tained, but they are given here as they are  given by Hedges and Howell, except that  Matthew is put before Isaac, because in  several conveyances, in which their names  appear jointly, the name of Matthew pre-  cedes that of Isaac, which suggests that  Matthew was the elder of the two. William  married a woman named Elizabeth, who  died February 28, 1724, 'aged near eighty.'  Children: i. Thomas, who married (first)  before March 3, 1692, the widow of Thomas  Bee, who died January 26. 1701, (second)  March 18, 1702, Mindwell Dibble. 2. Ben-  jamin, known as the 'Deacon,' born about  1671, died July 23, 1740; supposed to have     92     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     married a woman whose first name was  Abigail and had a child baptized at Bran-  ford, Connecticut, in August, 1701. 3.

He is mentioned by Pelletreau as a native of  Southampton and as descended from Charles  Barns, the first schoolmaster in that town.  On March 18, 1694, Isaac Barns entered the  earmark for his cattle at East Hampton.  On September 25, 1701, a conveyance was  made to him as of East Hampton, weaver,  by Thomas Barns, and on May 13, 1702, a  conveyance of land was made by Robert  Parsons to Matthew Barns, Isaac Barns and  Samuel Barns, in exchange for other land.

It is thus evident that besides  weaving Isaac must have engaged in hus-  bandry and brickmaking also, unless there  was another Isaac Barns. On July 25, 1705,  Isaac Barns, weaver, received a conveyance  of land from Samuel Barns, and on June 2,  1709. he received a conveyance of land from  Recompence Barns.

(IV) Isaac (2), eldest son of Isaac (i)  and Anna (Rogers) Barns, was born at East  Hampton. Long Island. January 29, 1705,  died April 22, 1772. He took considerable  interest in military affairs and was known  as the captain. In 1727, on the question of  pasturage rights at Montauk, he was credit-  ed with 15, 14, and 5.

There are similar records  showing like elections of Captain Barns in  1757-59-61. On September 29, 1762, Isaac  Barns was included in the commissions of  the justices of the peace to be assistant jus-  tice of the court of common pleas of the  county of Suffolk.

He  spent the greater part of his youth and early  manhood in his native place, and then re-  moved to Litchfield, Connecticut, where he  remained until about the close of the revolu-  tion.

He went with his par-     ents to Cooperstown in early life and re-  mained there until about the year 1830. His  next step was to engage in road building  which he did at the rate of ten dollars a  month and his board. In 1828 he came to  Orange county, New York, went into part-  nership with his brother, and between them  they purchased a yoke of o.xen and engaged  in the road building business for a number  of years. Nathaniel built the old Milton  turnpike and the pike from Cedar Cliff to  Plattekill, Ulster county. He also built the  road from Balmville to Plattekill, and the  Snake Hill turnpike out of Newburg. He  settled eventually at Middle Hope, in the  tov^'nship of Newburg, where he purchased  a farm of eighty-six acres. He remained  working on this farm until his death, sup-  plementing his agricultural pursuits with  occasional commercial transactions of vari-  ous sorts. He married, January 21, 1828, Ef-  fie, daughter of Dr. W'illiam Dusenberre, of  Modena, New York. Children : William  D. ; Nathaniel, mentioned below ; Mary E.  (VII) Nathaniel (2), second son of Na-  thaniel (i) and Efifie (Dusenberre) Barns,  was born near Newburg, Orange county.  New York, February 20, 1831. He was  educated in the district schools of New-  burg and at a high school at Marlborough,  New York, later teaching school himself  during one winter term. He did not feel in-  clined, however, to continue in this occu-  pation and when he was able he worked  one of his father's farms on shares, keeping  at this work for two years. He then bought  a tract of forty acres from his father and  cultivated it. Then he took a farm of ninety  acres with his father. This farm his father  later gave to him, deed for ninety acres,  and part of it is still in his possession. He  has become consequently well known as  a farmer and grower of small fruits, which  he has made his specialty. All of Mr. Barns'  time has, however, not been given to the  land. He has taken considerable interest in  the public questions of the day, and has  taken no small part in local affairs. In poli-  tics he is and has always been a Democrat.  In religion he is a Methodist, and he has  been a member of the Methodist church of  Middle Hope, Newburg, for the last sixty  years. He was elected assessor of the dis-  trict, and retained the position for a period     94     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     of nine years. He was excise commissioner  for two years, and from the year 1865 to  the year 1870 he held the office of the first  supervisor of the town of Newburg, and in  1870 was chosen chairman of the board.

Emma,  married Arthur Meyers, of Newburg.     There are many old towns in the  RING British Isles having or having   had an open space or circus where  in former times bullbaiting and such like  pastimes took place and these are some-  times called rings. Possibly the name Ring  may have been assumed or bestowed on  families because of their proximity to such  places. The name Ring is known in Eng-  land, Wales and Scotland, and in those  countries the above derivation seems not  improbable. Ring is a surname fairly prev-  alent in Ireland also. But the Irish family  is a branch of the royal 'Line of Heber.'  the chief ancestor being Daire Cearb, son  of Olioll Flann-Beag, and brother of Lug-  haidh, who is No. 88 on the Heber line. The  ancient form of the surname in Ireland and  the Gaelic provinces of Scotland was O'Bill-  rian, meaning the 'descendant of Billrian,'  who was the son of Dubartach. The arms  of this family are: Argent, on a bend gules  three crescents of the first. Crest: A hand  vested sa. cuffed or. holding a roll of paper.  (I) Benjamin Ring, the first ancestor of  the Ring family here dealt with in America,  was born in Wales, died in Pennsylvania.  He emigrated to Pennsylvania about 1750  and erected mills on the Brandywme. The     battle of Brandywine was fought partly on  the farm of Benjamin Ring, whose house  served as headquarters for Washington and  his stafT, consisting of Lafayette, Pulaski,  Knox and others, when making themselves  accjuainted with the surrounding country  and deciding on the battle ground. Al-  though Benjamin Ring was a Quaker and  on that account prevented from taking an  active part in the war it was well known  that he was a strong sympathizer with the  patriot cause. Just before the battle an  American spy informed him that it would be  unsafe for him to remain with his family,  that they had better leave taking with them  what valuables they could carry. His wife,  daughters, and young son, who drove,  hastily left in a carriage, carrying with them  nine hundred dollars in gold, a quantity of  silver plate and other articles, in all amount-  ing to quite a large sum, which, the roads  becoming blocked by troops, they were  obliged to abandon, making their escape  across the fields. Benjamin Ring with two  companions joined them on horseback, and  after seeing them to a place of safety, re-  turned to Washington, who had just heard  that his retreat was likely to be cut off.  Hearing the conversation he rode up to  Washington and pointed out a way by tak-  ing which he would cut off nearly two miles.  He said that he would pilot them, but be-  ing stout and advanced in years would not  be so suitable as his friend, William Har-  vey, a young man and fine horseman, and  one in whom the general could feel every  confidence. By hard riding across fields  and over fences the balance of the army was  rejoined and the retreat made in safety. Ben-  jamin Ring's house, which was of stone,  was used as a fort alternately by the con-  tending parties. The roof was riddled with  grape shot, one si.x pounder going through  the gable and there was not a place on the  walls large enough to lay one's hand upon  that did not bear a mark. Everything in-  side the house was destroyed, the farm was  cleared of cattle, and not a fence left on the  place. Benjamin Ring married Rachel  James. They had eight children, among  them Nathaniel, mentioned below.   (II) Nathaniel, son of Benjamin and  Rachel (James) Ring, was born in 1767, at  Brandywine, Pennsylvania, and died in     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     95     1850. He left his native place at an early  age and emigrated to Cornwall, Orange  county, New York. He was a millwright  by trade, and was captain of a sloop that  ran between New York City and Cornwall,  Orange county, for a score of years. H'^  was elected a ruling elder of New Windsor  church, July 6, 1783. He married, January  6, 1793, Martha Clark, born April 30, 1770,  died February, 1854, daughter of Jeremiah  Clark, of Cornwall, Orange county, New  York, who was born in Bedford, Westches-  ter county, New York, in 1730, died May  30, 1808. He married Martha Newman,  November 27, 1752. He was elected a rul-  ing elder of New Windsor church. He was  a man of much influence and prominence  and a firm friend of liberty and national  union. He passed the greater part of his  life at Cornwall, Orange county. New York.  He was a member of the first provincial  congress from Orange county in 1775, of  the second provincial congress in 1775 and   1776, and of the fourth provincial congress  and representation convention in 1776 and   1777, at the last session of which the first  constitution of the state of New York was  formed at Kingston, April 20, 1777. He  was a member of the assembly of New  York from Orange county, beginning with  the first assembly of the state, which met at  Kingston. September i, 1777, and of the as-  semblies of later years. He also filled the  offices of sheriff and lay judge of Orange  county. New York.   (Ill) Thomas C. son of Nathaniel and  Martha (Clark) Ring, was born at Corn-  wall, Orange county, New York, October  21, 1804, di'ed May 8, 1889. His early life  was passed at home where he enjoyed the  advantages of a common school education.  At the age of thirteen he left the care of  his parents and with no other capital than  strong hands and an industrious and ambi-  tious spirit he started out to encounter the  duties of life. His first position was that of  clerk in a general store owned by Oliver G.  Burton at West Point, in which place he re-  mained for three years. He then returned  home and assisted his father in his brick-  yard. In 1821 he came to Newburg and  was a clerk for M. G. Miller, a general trader.  About 1825 he was appointed to a clerk-  ship in the Newburg Bank, a position which     he filled for about two years, and in 183 1  he was a clerk on the steamship 'Albany,'  and in 1832 on the steamship 'New Phila-  delphia,' running between New York and  Albany. In 1833 ^^ became cashier of the  Highland Bank of Newburg and served  until 1838, and in the following year he be-  came cashier of the Powell Bank, a position  which he held until 1864, in which year they  went out of business. In 1858 he was made  treasurer of the Newburg Savings Bank,  in which office he served until his death.  In 1858 and the years following until 1864  he was superintendent of the ferry between  Fishkill and Newburg. He was treasurer  for the village of Newburg from 1854 until  1868. He was a member of the first board  of education, and from 1867 until 1881 was  secretary of the Newburg Gas Light Com-  pany. He participated in the reception to  General Lafayette in 1826, and was a mem-  ber of the militia under Captain John D.  Phillipse. Mr. Ring was recognized as one  of the old, substantial citizens of Newburg  and was held in high esteem by all classes of  people. Starting out in life with small  means and at a tender age, he by close  application to duty and industrious regular  habits achieved success in various undertak-  ings in which he engaged and won for  himself a reputation as an upright and hon-  orable man. When he first entered the  Newburg Savings Bank the total deposit at  the institute aggregated about twenty-eight  thousand dollars. This amount, owing to  careful management, judicious investment  and the confidence of the public, increased  to many millions.   Mr. Ring married (first) Mary Ann Os-  borne, who died in 1833. He married (sec-  ond) Catherine Speir. Children: A. Smith,  mentioned below; Anna, married a Mr.  Muir; Clara, died in infancy.   fIV) A.

He was educated at the Newburg  Free Academy, and at an early age entered  the Powell Bank, where his father was em-  ployed and when the latter became treas-  urer of the Newburg Savings Bank he went  with him and was connected with that in-     96     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     stitution until a few years before his death.  He was a staunch Democrat. He was a  member of the Ringold Hose Company, was  treasurer of Washington's Headquarters and  trustee of the Newburg Skating Associa-  tion. In 1875 he was elected city treasurer,  serving for two years. Much of his time in  later life was devoted to philanthropic work  and he was much interested in the Board of  Associated Charities, being one of its mana-  gers. He was a man of more than ordinary  ability, and one whose liberality and kind-  ness will long be remembered by the re-  cipients of his bounty. He married, Oc-  tober 5, 1881, Frances Ludlow, born April  I, 1864, daughter of George W. Kerr, of  whom further. There was one son of the  m.arriage: Thomas Ludlow, who is unmar-  ried and is employed in the Newburg Na-  tional Bank.   George W. Kerr, father of Mrs. A. Smith  Ring, was born in Warren county. New Jer-  sey, February 15, 1810, died June 3, 1890.  He was for more than half a century an  officer of one of Orange county's strongest  financial institutions. His ancestors were  originally from Scotland, but Mr. Kerr's  father was born at Freehold, New Jersey.  His parents removed to Ithaca, New York,  where he obtained a position in the branch  of the Bank of Newburg. In 1830, when  the branch was withdrawn, and the Bank of  Ithaca established, Mr. Kerr entered the  new bank and remained there until Oc-  tober, 1831, when a position was offered  him in the Bank of Newburg, with the offi-  cials of which he had become acquainted  through his connection with the branch  bank. In 1836 Mr. Kerr was promoted to  the iiosition of cashier, and in 1854 he was  elected president to fill the vacancy caused  by the death of John Chambers. In 1864,  when the old Bank of Newburg was re-  organized under the National banking act  as the National Bank of Newburg. Mr. Kerr  was again honored with the presidency. He  continued in that position until his death,  having been cashier of the bank for eight-  een years, and president for thirty-seven  years. Mr. Kerr was a trustee and vice-  president of the village in 1856, and a mem-  ber of the board of education in 1852 and  the years following up to 1854. For forty-  seven years he was a vestryman of St.     George's Protestant Episcopal Church, and  for thirty-one years treasurer of the board.  Upon his death the directors of the bank  adopted the following minute:   'His sound judgment, perfect integrity, and emi-  nent ability, have been long recognized in financial  circles, and his e.xcellence in all the relations of life  will be long remembered in this community. By  us his immediate associates, and by all in any ca-  pacity attached to this bank, his memory will be  cherished. He has left to his family and to this  community, where he has spent so many years of  a long and useful life, a leeacy better than earthly  riches — a good name.'   The vestry of St. George's Church adopt-  ed resolutions recording their  'very high esteem for his character and life-  long devotion to the church and her interests. It is  with grateful feeling that we remember the steady  consistency of his Christian walk, his uprightness as  a business man, his value as a citizen, his zeal as a  churchman. We owe him no slight debt for his  faithful service as our treasurer for thirty-one years,  during which time his unflagging attention to the  affairs of the parish has contributed essentially and  in a large degree to its stability and prosperity.'   Mr. Kerr married (first) Emeline Ross;  (second) Margaret T. L., daughter of the  Rev. John Brown, D. D. There were twelve  children of the latter marriage, of whom  six daughters and two sons survive. The  two sons are John B., of whom further, and  Walter, who is vice-president of the New  York Life Insurance and Trust Company,  New York City.   John B.

This family sprang from  LEEPER French ancestors, said to  have gone from France to  Scotland in the train of Mary Queen of  Scots. The name has undergone radical  change, but may be identified through its  various changes from La Pierre Lapeare,  Leiper and in this branch as Leeper.

In the fall of 1861 he  commanded the guard which escorted the  first detachment of Confederate prisoners  sent to Camp Chase at Columbus, Ohio, and  in 1862 was promoted first lieutenant of  Company G, of his regiment. While a lieu-  tenant he was hotly engaged with his regi-  ment at the battle of Shiloh (Pittsburgh  Landing) and saw other hard service. He  then passed through an attack of typhoid  fever and on his recovery was transferred  to Company E, One Hundred and Fortieth  Regiment New York Volunteers, with the     98     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     same rank, first lieutenant. At the battle of  Fredericksburg he won a captain's commis-  sion 'For gallant and meritorious conduct.'  He was in constant service until Chancel-  lorsville, where he was wounded and again  at the battle of Gettysburg, where he was  seriously injured in the head, narrowly es-  caping sudden death. After recovery he  was traisferred to the veteran service as  captain of Company G, First Regiment,  First Army Corps (Hancock's). He was  honorably discharged at the close of the  war, in which he had borne so conspicuous  a part, and returned to New York.   He fir3t settled on a farm at Montgomery,  Orange county, where until 1889 he en-  gaged in farming. In the latter year he  moved to Newburg and again engaged in  legal practice, continuing in successful  practice until his death. He served three  years as recorded in Newburg, from 1858 to  1861, on the Democratic ticket, nevertheless  he cast liis vote for Abraham Lincoln. In  later years he served as justice of the peace  of Montgomery. He was breveted a colo-  nel. He was a member of Calvary Presby-  terian church of Newburg, of the Independ-  ent Order of Odd Fellows and Grand  Army of the Republic. He was a man of  influence in his community.

The Galbraith family is of remotest an-  tiquity, the name being derived from the  Celtic. It was in the Parish of Baldunoch,  county Sterling, that the Galbraiths of Bal-  dunoch, chiefs of the name, had their resi-  dence. In Frazier's statistical account of  the inhabitants of the Isle of Giglia the fol-  lowing occurs: 'The majority of them are  of the names Galbraith and McNeil, the for-  mer reckoned the more ancient.' The Gal-  braiths in the Celtic languages are called  Breatannieh, that is Britons, or the children  of the Briton, and were once reckoned a  great name in Scotland, according to the  following lines, translated from the Gaelic :  'Galbraiths from the Red Tower, Noblest  of all Scottish surnames.'   (I) The first of this branch of whom there  is definite mention is John Galbraith, who  probably died before the emigration of his  sons to America. Sons: i. James, of whom  further. 2. John, who married and left is-  sue. After his arrival in this country he  spent several years in Philadelphia, but lit-  tle is known of him.   (II) James, son of John Galbraith, of  Scotch parentage, was born in the North of  Ireland in 1666, died in Chester county,  Pennsylvania, August 23, 1744.

He was one of the founders of the old Derry  Church, a man of prominence and the  founder of a remarkable family. He is bur-  ied in the old churchyard at Derry. He  married Rebecca, daughter of Arthur Cham-  bers. Children: i. John, born in Ireland.  1690, died in Donegal township, Lancaster  county, Pennsylvania, in October, 1753 : he  was a miller by trade and in 1721 built a  grist and saw mill at the run along the  'Great Road'; kept an 'ordinary''; was  sheriff of Lancaster county in 1731, and a  member of the first grand jury drawn in  that county; he married Jane and left     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     99     issue. 2.

He took up a tract in  (now) Derry township, Dauphin county, on  Spring Creek, which was warranted to him  March 13, 1737. He became a man of note  on the frontier, and the early provincial rec-  ords of Pennsylvania contain frequent ref-  erences to him. He was elected sheriff in  October, 1742; was for many years one of  the justices of Lancaster county; served as  an officer during the Indian wars of 1755-  63. Prior to the revolutionary period he  moved to Cumberland county.

He received the best education  the schools of his day afiforded, and became  a proficient surveyor, following that profes-  sion for many years. During the French  and Indian wars Colonel Galbraith served  as an ofticer of a company of rangers, formed  for the protection of the frontier. From  1760 to 1775, acting in his professional ca-  pacity, he surveyed the greater portion of  the lands located in the present counties of  Dauphin, Perry and Juniata. He was a  member of the provincial convention of  January 23, 1775, delegate to the provincial  conference of June 18, 1776, and member of  the constitutional convention of July 15,  1776. During tliat same year he was elect-  ed colonel of one of the Lancaster battalions  of associators, and was on duty in the Jer-  seys during the greater portion of that year,  serving also as a member of the Pennsyl-  vania assembly, 1776-77. On June 3, 1777,  he was appointed county lieutenant, a very  responsible position; November 8, 1777, one  of the commissioners to collect clothing for  the army ; on December 16, 1777, appointed  by the assembly to take subscriptions to the  continental loan. He was one of the com-  missioners who met at New Haven, Con-  necticut, November 22, 1777, to regulate the     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     prices of commodities in the colonies. After  four years of hard and exhaustive labor he  was compelled to resign the office of county  lieutenant, but remained an officer of the  militia until peace was restored. In 1789 he  was appointed one of the commissioners to  view the Juniata and Susquehanna rivers  and mark the places where locks or canals  were necessary to make these streams nav-  igable. He was appointed state deputy sur-  veyor, November 4, 1791, and while acting  as such took up large tracts of land in  Lykens Valley. He died before patents  were issued to him and in the litigation that  followed his heirs lost all the magnificent  estate intended for them by their father.   Colonel Galbraith married (first) Ann  Scott, born December 26, 1741, died June  29, 1793. daughter of Joseph Scott, of Done-  gal.

September 28,  1820, George Reynolds Leeper (see Leeper  II).     James Edmonston, the  EDMONSTON founder of this family,   emigrated in 1720 from  Enniskillen, county Tyrone, Ireland, to  .America. He landed at Plymouth, Massa-  chusetts, where he remained for seven years  and then removed to New Windsor, Orange  county. New York, where he bought two  hundred acres of land located just west of  Vail's Gate. Here he built what has for  many years been known as the old stone  Edmonstone house, which with some of the  land purchased by him is still owned by his  descendants. For this property James Ed-  monston gave the Widow Ingoldsby twenty  shillings an acre. His first house was of  logs, and when built was the only house  between New Windsor and Washington-  ville. He married, in Ireland, Margaret  Smith, who with her nephew, Benjamin  Smith, the founder of the family of his name  in Newburg, accompanied her husband to  .America. Children : William, referred to  below ; Sally, married Patrick McDaniel.   dl) William, son of James and Margaret  (Smith) Edmonston, was one of the old set-  tlers of New Windsor township. Orange  county. New York, during the revolution,  and owing to his great acquaintance with  the country roundabout. General W^ashing-  ton selected him to accompany himself and  Colonel Pickering and help to select a suit-  able camp ground for the army. Edmon-  ston took the two along the old Indian path  until they came to the Square which was  chosen as the site of the camp. While here  the soldiers commandeered all except about  sixteen bushels of Edmonston's large field  of potatoes and shot down sixteen of his  hogs. The hospital stores, while the army  was encamped at the Square, were kept in  his house, which was also the headquarters  of Generals Gates and St. Clair. He mar-     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     ried Jane, daughter of David Sutherland, of  Canterbury, Cornwall. Children: Four  daughters, names unknown ; James, referred  to below; William, married Mary, daughter  of Daniel Tompkins, of Westchester; David,  married Margaret Dunning, of Scotchtown,  Orange county. New York.   (III) James (2), son of William and Jane  (Sutherland) Edmonston, was a farmer  near Newburg, New York, where he died in  1844. He served as a major in the revolu-  tion. He married Gertrude Harris, of  Poughkeepsie. Children : Samuel, a phy-  sician in New York City ; DeWitt Clinton,  a physician in Newburg; Harris, a physi-  cian, first at Washingtonville, and then at  Newburg; W^illiam H., a physician at Jack-  sonville, Florida ; Thomas, referred to be-  low.   (IV) Thomas, son of James (2) and Ger-  trude (Harris) Edmonston, was born on the  homestead near Newburg, New York,  March 13, 1804, died at Chester, Orange  county, New York, March 11, 1852. He  studied melicine with Dr. J. M. Gardiner,  of Newburg. and established himself in the  drug business there. January 20, 1820, he  was granted a license to practice medicine  by the Herkimer Medical Society and he  then settled himself at Chester where he  built up a large practice and became the  most prominent physician in that section of  the country. He was a member of the  Presbvterian church at Chester. He mar-  ried Drusilla, daughter of John and Chris-  tina (Welles) Decker, who on her father's  side was a descendant of the early settlers  of Esopus, Ulster county. New York, and  on her mother's side came from Sarah  Welles, the first white woman settler in the  town of Goshen, New York. Drusilla Deck-  er had one sister, Cornelia, wife of George  G. Mitchell, and one brother, Theodore  Welles Decker, a graduate of Rensselaer  Polytechnic at Troy, New York. Children  of Mr. and Mrs. Edmonston: John Decker  and Cornelia Mitchell, both of whom reside  in Chester.     There is an English sur-  GOODSELL name of Goodsell. but in   the case of the family here  dealt with the name is German in origin.  Tn this case it is possibly a modern form of     the German family name of Goetschel,  which is related to the other names Gotsch,  Gotsche, Gottsche, Goetsch and Goedschel.  The British name of Goodsell, which is not  very prevalent, is hypothetically deduced by  one authority from the local name of God-  shill in the Isle of Wight. By another ety-  mologist it is thought to be derived from  the personal name, Godesilus, the name of  an early Burgundian king, and may thus  quite likely have a Norman origin. The  name is now a well known American one.  One of the leading representatives in the  earlier records was Thomas Goodsell, of  East Haven, Connecticut, who is thought to  have been born in Somerset county, Eng-  land, in 1646, died in East Haven in 1713.  He was a graduate of Trinity College and  was for a time at Oxford University. He  married, June 4, 1684, Sarah, daughter of  Samuel Hemenway, the largest taxpayer,  elector of the colony, and selectman.   (I) Theodore Goodsell, the paternal an-  cestor in Germany of the Goodsell family in  America here dealt with, was born at Baden,  Germany, in 1801, died in Baden, Germany,  in 1848. He was a butcher by occupation,  l)Ut probably in a very large and prosperous  way, for he eventually held high ofifice and  public position. He was a burgomaster in  his native land, a position akin to that of  m.ayor in this country, but not usually elect-  ive, and one of great responsibility and  honor. He married Rosa Goodsel, born in  i8oi, died in 1884. They had ten children,  among whom were : Theresa, deceased ;  Rosa, died December, 1912, married George  Stevens, of Highland Falls, New York, who  is also deceased; Anthony, who belonged to  Regan's Battery, and was killed at the bat-  tle of Fair Oaks; Martha; Joseph, deceased;  Catherine, deceased; Louis F., mentioned be-  low.   (II) Senator Louis F. Goodsell, son of  Theodore and Rosa (Goodsel) Goodsell,  was born at Baden, Germany, January 30.  1846. He spent his first four infant years  in Germany and was brought to this coun-  try, July 4, 1850. He was educated in  Tracy's Military Academy, at Ossining,  New York. At the early age of seventeen  and while still attending school he enlisted  in Company F, Forty-seventh Regiment  New York \'olunteers, and was mustered     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     out in May, 1867. During the period when  lie saw active service in the civil war he was  present in the engagements at Bentonville,  bmithtield and Fort Fisher, lie was mus-  tered tiut on August 30, 1S65, and re-entered  sthool. In May, 1867, he graduated from  Eastman's Business College at Poughkeep-  sie. New York. The next two years were  spent in Omaha and Nebraska, and from  i^ih;; to 1S78 he was a resident of Newburg,  and then five years at Savannah, Georgia,  In 1885 he was' engaged in the oil business  in Chicago, and the lumber business at Ot-  tumwa. Iowa. In 1887 he returned to High-  land Falls, New York. There he was a  meniijer of the board of supervisors for  eighteen years, and in 1894 was elected a  member of the assembly first district,  Orange county, being re-elected in the years  1895-96-97. In 1898 he was elected state  senator from the twenty-third district, and  re-elected in 1900-02-04. He has always  been a firm believer in the principles of the  Republican party.   He married, October 19, 1869, Frances A.,  daughter of David and Mary (Gosling)  I arry, of Bucks county. Pennsylvania.  Children: Edith; Harry, born January i,  1887 ; he married Jennie Mandigo, born and  hving at Highland Falls, New York.     The family name of Rath-  RATIIBONE bone is derived from the   Saxon language, and sig-  nifies an early gift. There have been vari-  ous spellings of the name in this country,  but some of them result from mistake. It  is liest to speak only of tliosc who, belong-  ing to the same family by various lines of  descent, have adhered to definite forms. It  is declared, with good authority that the  smiilar name of Rabone (Rabun) was of the  s.imc origin, as were also Rawsbone and  Rathbun. In James Savage's 'Genealogical  Dictionary,' i)rominent mention is made of  George Rabun, and in Belknap's 'History  of New Hami)shire' it is stated that this was  probably a mistake for George Rathbone,  who was in Exeter in if\y). The year previ-  ous he haci sympathized with Rev. Mr.  Wheelwright, a man of considerable learn-  ing. ])icty and position, and the brother of  Mrs. Anne Hutchinson. With him Rabun  or Rathbone was banished from Boston for     defending his religious opinions. Having  been deprived of his privileges he combined  with some others suflfering the same fate,  about thirty-five in all, and set up an inde-  pendent government at Squamscot F'alls,  New Hampshire, naming the place Exeter.  The Rathbone arms consist of a shield ar-  gent three doves azure. Crest : A dove  proper hcjlding an olive branch. Motto:  Suaviter et fortiter.   Regarding the origin of the family in  America there were several accounts for-  merly current. It was asserted that this  family descended from Thomas Rathbone,  who came from England in 1621. A second  statement is to the effect that those of the  name came from John Rathbone, a member  of a Liverpool family, who came to America  in 1625. Another explanation is that they  are descended from an elder Ijrother of Colo-  nel John Rathbone, who was an officer of  the parliamentary army of 1658, noted for  his devotion to republican principles. The  earliest authentic records point to Rev.  William Rathbone as the first of the name  aj/pearing in America, and allusion is made  to him in a work published in 1637, which  item was reprinted in the 'Historical Col-  lections of Massachusetts.' This man was  an author. It is shown that his doctrinal  views were not in accord with those of the  members of the Massachusetts colony. It  is beliexed that he and his descendants were  not admitted into the New England church,  with the consequence that they were not  permitted to participate in general public  affairs. The Rhode Island colonial records  mention John Rawsbone, of New Shore-  ham, as one who w-as admitted to full politi-  cal rights as freeman on May 4. 1664, being  the same person whom the Block Island  records name John Rathbone. The latter  was one of those who met at the house of  Dr. Alcock on August 17. 1660, to confer  regarding the purchase of Block Island, and  was one of the original sixteen purchasers  of that island from Governor Endicott and  three others, to whom it had been granted  for public services ; hence, he will long con-  tinue to figure in the country's history.  John Rathbone was chosen in 1676 one of  the surveyors of highways. He occu])iL'(l a  place in the Rhode Island general assemblv  in 1682-83-84 as representative from Block     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     103     Island. He was one of the petitioners to  the king of Great Britain in 1686 in refer-  ence to the 'Quo Warranto,' and was one  of the Rhode Island grand jury in 1688. He  had an interesting experience during the  French and Indian wars, which has been  handed down with authenticity as family  history. In July, 1689, Mr. Rathbone had  a narrow escape from the French, who had  come in three vessels and were then pillag-  ing the island. They inquired of some one  or more of the people 'who were the likliest  among them to have money.' They were  told of John Rathbone as the most likely.  The French proceeded to capture him, as  they supposed, and demanded money. The  captive denied having any but a trifling sum.  They endeavored to make him confess that  he had more and to deliver it to them, by  tying him up and whipping him barbarous-  ly. While they were doing all this to an  innocent man whom they mistook for the  monied John Rathbone, the latter escaped  with his treasure. They had mistaken the  son, who by submitting to this crueltv in  the room of his father saved the latter from  being robbed.   That the lives of the early Rathbones who  settled on Block Island were fraught with  severe hardship and almost continuous dan-  ger may well be believed from all accounts.  In his history of Rhode Island Arnold  makes this reference : 'The local history  of Block Island, truthfully written, would  present an interesting study. The tradi-  tional history of the aborigines is full of the  romance of the war. Their authentic his-  tory in connection with the whites abounds  in stirring incidents, the peculiarities of the  English settlers and their posterity, their  customs, laws and domestic institutions are  among the most singular and interesting  developments of civilized life, while the  martial defense of a people, within and  around whose island there has been more  hard fighting than on any territory of equal  extent in America, and where the horrors  of savage and of civilized warfare have al-  ternately prevailed, almost without cessa-  tion from the earliest traditionary period  down to a recent date would altogether fur-  nish material for a thrilling history that  might rival the pages of a romance. The  dangers of the sea and the sterner perils of     war united to produce a' race of men whose  courage and hardihood cannot be surpassed.  It was out of such material that naval he-  roes were made.' Of this character were  the men, and women also, of the earlier  generations of the Rathbone family.   (I) John Rathbone, of Block Island, was  horn about 1634, died there between Febru-  ary 12, 1702, the day on which he signed his  will, and October 6, 1702, the date on which  Simon Ray, warden, took oath that William  Hancock Jr., James W'elch and Roger Dick-  ens appeared before him to testify 'that  they were testimony to the signing and  sealing.' It is an interesting family docu-  ment, and a portion of it is worth citing.  ■'I give and bequeath to my son Samuel  Rathbone the table and cubbard which  stand now in his house as for are lomes  (Heirlooms?) to the house, and I leave my  wife Margaret Rathbone my executrix of  all my movable and household goods, houses  and chattels, cattle, sheep and horse kind ;  and I leave (her?) the income of my house  at Newport for her lifetime, and at her de-  cease the westward (end?) of my house at  Newport, and the leanto of that end so far  as the post that the door hangs on, and the  shop to be left for my son John Rathbone's  son John, and his heirs forever; and the  eastward end of said house and the rest of  the leanto to be left for my son William  Rathbone's son John and his heirs forever,  and the yard to be equally for their use.  And I leave to my wife for her life-time the  twenty acres of land which I bought of  Henry Hall, and the running of two cows  and a horse and the end of the house which  I now live in ; and I leave that my four sons  shall pay to my wife during her life-time  forty shillings apiece a year. And I leave  to my wife during her life-time my nigger  man, and at her disposing, and at her de-  cease to my son Thomas Rathbone for three  years, and at the end of the three years, to  give him as good clothes as his mistress  leaves him, and then to set him free.' It  may be said in this connection that the fam-  ily lands at Newport greatly increased in  value, as did the estate situated on Block  Island, and while he gave evidence of abo-  lition tendencies by his provision for this  negro he did not care to put his ideas into  efl'ect while he yet lived.

(II) John (2). son of John (i) and Mar-  garet (Dodge) Rathbone, was born in Rox-  bury. Massachusetts, in 1658. He was ad-  mitted a freeman by the assembly of Rhode  Island, May 5, 1696. He received from his  father, just previous to his marriage, a deed  for sixty acres of land on Block Island, the  nominal consideration for which was 'one  barrel of ])ork on demand.' It may be con-  cluded that this farm was. therefore, a wed-  ding present or settlement. It is known  that the father some years before his death  settled his sons on farms on the island  where he lived, and entertained great hopes  that his descendants would dwell there for-  ever. Their grandchildren, however, scat-  tered, leaving Samuel Rathbone's descend-  ants the only ones of the name on that isl-  and. Tiie original settler's grandson Jona-  than, son of John Rathbone (2), removed to  Colchester. Connecticut, and is the ancestor  of the Rathboncs of Albany, New York, as  well as those of Otsego county. New York.  Joshua, another son of John (2). settled at  Stonington. Connecticut, and is the ancestor  of the Rathbones of New York City. Other  sons of the same, John, Benjamin. Nathan-  iel and Thomas settled in Exeter. Rhode  Island. Elijah, son of Samuel, settled in  Groton. Connecticut, and in this way the  family spread to various sections of the  country, while very few represented the old  stock at the place of original settlement.  On December 13, 1698 'Great James' and  Jane, his wife, two Indians, bound their  d.nughter, Betsey, to John Rathbone (2) and  his wife, as an indented servant for eighteen  vcars, the consideration being only one gal-  lon of rum and one blanket in hand, and five  years after one gallon of rum, and yearly  thereafter. If she remained five years then  the said Rathbone was to pay four blankets,  and one every third vc;ir thfrc.iftcr. John     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     (2) Rathbone married, January 10, 1688,  Ann Dodge.

He  came to reside in Albany, New York, in the  fall of 1822, as a clerk in his brother Valen-  tine W. Rathbone's wholesale grocery store,  on the corner of Hudson avenue and Quay  street, then the busiest section of the city.  Two years later he became associated with     his brother in the business. In 1827 as one  of the firm of Hermans, Rathbone & Com-  pany he commenced the wholesale stove  business. By reason of certain modifica-  tions and improvements in the patterns of  stoves made under his direction, he secured  a very large and lucrative business, which  became known all over the country, and  doubtless was the most important concern  of the kind then in America, destined to  make the name of Rathbone known for the  century or more. Following the death of  Mr. Hermans in 1829 Mr. Rathbone suc-  ceeded to the entire business, which he con-  tinued in his own name until 1841. At the  early age of thirty-five years with a well-  earned fortune he then retired from active  mercantile pursuits to the enjoyment of  country life. He purchased a large estate  bordering the southern end of Albany,  which he laid out and made beautiful.  'Kenwood,'' as it was named, became his  lesidence for a number of years. Although  retiring from business cares so early he was  still connected with many of the public en-  terprises of Albany, being vice-president of  the New York State Bank, the oldest insti-  tution in the city; president of the Ex-  change Company, doing business where the  Federal Building was located in 1910; and  an active cooperator in and generous con-  tributor to most of the benevolent enter-  prises of Albany.

He was appointed quar-  termaster by Governor Horatio Seymour in  1862. with the rank of brigadier-general.

The name of Brewster ap-  BREWSTER pears among the old fam-  ilies in the reign of Ed-  ward III., as ranking among the 'English  Landed Gentry.' John Brewster was wit-  ness to a deed in the parish of Henstead, in  Suffolk, in the year 1375, and not long after,  in the reign of Richard II., a John Brewster  was presented to the rectory of Godwich, in  the county of Norfolk. This Norfolk branch  became connected by marriage with the dis-  tinguished houses of DeNarburgh, Spelman,  Gleane and Coke, of Nolkham ; and, in the  county of Suffolk, Robert Brewster, of Mut-  ford, possessed also lands in Henstead, and  Robert Brewster, of Rushmore, died pos-  sessed of these estates prior to 1482. From  this Suffolk connection a branch became es-  tablished at Castle Hedingham, in Essex,  and formed connection with several knight-  ly families. Elder William Brewster was  probably of this connection. It is supposed  that Scrooby, a Nottinghamshire village,  was his birthplace, whither he went after  leaving a responsible position in the service  of Mr. William Davison, who was one of  Queen Elizabeth's ambassadors, and after-  wards one of her principal secretaries of  state.   (I) William Brewster Sr. lived in Scroo-  by, Nottinghamshire, England, as early as  1570-71, in which year he was assessed in  that town on goods valued at £3. In 1575-76  lie was appointed by Archbishop Sandys re-  ceiver of Scrooby and bailiff of the manor-  house in that place belonging to the bishop,  to have life tenure of both offices. Some  time in the year 1588, or possibly before, he  was appointed to the additional office of  postmaster under the Crown. He was  known as the 'Post' of Scrooby, and was     io8     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     master of the court mails, which were ac-  cessible only to those connected with the  court. He died in the summer of 1590. His   wife was Prudence . Child: William,   mentioned below.   (H) Elder William Brewster, who cama  in the 'Mayflower,' was born during the  last half of the year 1566 or the first half of  1567, the date being fixed by an affidavit  made by him at Levden, June 25, 1609, when  he declared his age to be forty-two years.  The place of his birth is not known, but it  is supposed to have been Scrooby. The  parish registers of Scrooby do not begin  until 1695, and no record of Brewster's  birth, baptism or marriage, has ever been  discovered. He matriculated at Peterhouse,  which was then the 'oldest of the fourteen  colleges grouped into the University of  Cambridge,' IDecember 3, 1580, but does not  appear to have stayed long enough to take  his degree. He is next found as a 'discreete  and faithful!' assistant of William Davison,  secretary of state to Queen Elizabeth, and  accompanied that gentleman on his embassy  to the Netherlands in August, 1585. and  served him at court after his return until  his downfall in 1587. He then returned to  Scrooby, where he was held in high esteem  among the people of that place, and did  much good 'in promoting and furthering  religion.' In 1590 he was appointed ad-  ministrator of the estate of hi.s father, who  died in the summer of that year, and suc-  ceeded him as postmaster, which position  he held until September 30, 1607. While in  Scrooby he lived in the old manor-house,  where the members of the Pilgrim church  were accustomed to meet on Sunday. When  the Pilgrims attempted to remove to' Holland  in the latter ])art of 1607, ^^^ey were im-  prisf>ncd at Boston. Brewster was among  those imprisoned and suffered the greatest  loss. After he reached Holland he endured  many unaccustomed hardships, not being  as well fitted as the other Pilgrims for the  hard labnr which was their common lot.  and spent most of his means in providing  for his children. During the latter part of  the twelve years spent in Holland he in-  creased his income by teaching, and by the  profits from a printing press which he set  up in Lcydon. When after the twelve years  i' was decided that the church at Levden     should emigrate to Virginia, Brewster, who  had already been chosen elder, was desired  to go with the first company. He was,  therefore, with his wife Mary and two  young sons, among the jnissengers of the  'Mayflower,' which landed in Plymouth  harbor, December 16, 1620. Here he bore  an important part in establishing the Pil-  grim repul)lic, was one of the signers of the  famous compact, and believed to have draft-  ed the same. He was the moral, religious  and spiritual leader of the colonj' during its  first years, and its chief civil adviser and  trusted guide until his death. His wife  Mary died .\pril 17, 1627, somewhat- less  than .sixty years old. Elder Brewster died  April 10. 1644, in Plj'mouth, and a final  di\ision of his estate was made by Bradford,  Winslow, Prence and Standish, between  Jonathan and I^ove, his only remaining chil-  dren. Children: Jonathan, born August  12, 1593, at Scrooby; Patience; Fear; child,  died at Leyden, buried June 20, 1609; Love;  Wrestling, came in the 'Mayflow-er' w'ith  his parents and brother Love, was living at  the time of the division of cattle. Mav 22,  1627.   (HI) Jonathan, son of Elder \\ illiam  Brewster, was born August 12, 1593, in  Scrooby, Nottinghamshire, England, and  came over in the ship 'Fortune,' 1621. He  married Lucretia Oldham, of Darby. April  10. 1624. doubtless a sister of John Oldham,  whri came to Plymouth about 1623. She  died March 4, 1678-79. He had married be-  fore at an early age, and buried his wife and  a child by this marriage in Leyden, May 10,  1619; one child surviving^ Nathaniel, men-  tioned below. He moved from Plymouth to  Duxbury about 1630, and from there was dep-  uty to the general court. Plymouth colony,  in 1639-41-43-44. From there he removed  to New London about 1649, and settled in  that part later established as Norwich, his  farm lying in both towns. He was admit-  ted an inhabitant there February 25, 1649-  50, and was deputy to the general court of  the colony in 1650-55-56-57-58. He engaged  in the coasting trade, and was master of a  small vessel plying from Plymouth along  the coast of Virginia. In this way he be-  came acquainted with Pequot harbor, and  entered the river to trade with the Invlians.  He was clerk of the town of Pequot, Sep-     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     109     tember, 1649, and received his first grant of  land in that town in the same month from  Uncas, Sachem of the Mohegans, with  whom he had estabhshed a trading house.  At this latter place, still called by his name,  Brewster's Neck, he laid out for himself a  large farm. The deed of this land was con-  firmed by the town November 30. 1652, and  its bounds determined. In 1637 he was a  military commissioner in the Pequot war,  in 1642 a member of the Du.xbury commit-  tee to raise forces in the Narragansett alarm  of that year, and a member of Captain  Myles Standish's Duxbury company in the  military enrollment of 1643. He was promi-  nent in the formation of the settlement of  Duxbury and in the establishment of its  church ; sometimes practiced as an attorney,  and was also styled gentleman. He died  August 7, 1659, and was buried in the Brew-  ster cemetery at Brewster's Neck, Preston.  A plain granite shaft, about eight feet high,  was erected in 1855 to his memory and that  of his wife. The original footstone is still  in existence, and leans against the modern  monument. No probate papers relating to  his estate have been found, but bills of sale  are recorded, dated in 1658, which conveyed  all his property in the town plot, and his  house and lands at Poquetannuck, with his  movable property, to his son Benjamin and  son-in-law John Picket. His widow was  evidently a woman of note and respectabil-  ity among her fellow citizens. She had al-  ways the prefix of Mrs. or Mistress, and  was usually recorded in some useful ca-  pacity as nurse or doctor, as a witness to  wills, etc. Children, the first three born in  Plymouth, the fourth in Jones River, the  others in Duxbury: William. March 9, 1625:  Mary, April 16, 1627; Jonathan. July 17,  1629: Ruth, October 3, 163 1 ; Benjamin, No-  vember T7, 1633: Elizabeth. May i, 1637;  Grace, November i, 1639, married Captain  Daniel \\^etherell, had child, Mary, married  George Denison ; Hannah, November 3,  1641.   (lY) Nathaniel Brewster, supposed to  have been a son of Jonathan Brewster by  his first marriage, was born about 1619. He  died at Setauket, Long Island, December  18, 1690. 'aged seventy years.' The ages  of people as stated in those early days are  notoriously inaccurate, and he was prob-     ably more nearly seventy-two than seventy  years of age at death. He graduated in the ,  first class of Harvard College in 1642, and  settled soon after at Abby, county Norfolk,  England, where he pursued studies in the-  ology. Going from England to Ireland, he  presented a letter from Oliver Cromwell to  Fleetwood, the Lord Deputy of Ireland,  dated June 22, 1655. In this letter Crom-  well said : 'Use this bearer, Mr. Brewster  kindly. Let him be near you; indeed he is  a very able and holy man. Trust me and  you will find him so.' He received the de-  gree of Bachelor of Divinity from Dublin  University, returned to America and was  minister of the First Church at Boston in  1663. In 1665 he became the first minister  at Brookhaven, Long Island, and thus con-  tinued thirty-five years, until his death in  1690, as above noted. He married Sarah,  daughter of Roger Ludlow, and had sons :  John, Timothy and Daniel.   (V) John, eldest son of Nathaniel and  Sarah (Ludlow) Brewster, lived in Brook-  haven, and but little is known concerning  him.   (VI) Samuel, son of John Brewster, was  born July 18, 1718, in Brookhaven, and died  in New W'indsor, Orange county. New  York. He was among the original pat-  entees of the town of New W'indsor in 175 1-  52, and was a member of the committee of  safety during the revolution. He was  buried in the old graveyard at New \Vind-  sor, overlooking Newburgh Bay. He built  a saw mill, forge and anchor shop, and as-  sisted in forging the chain which was  stretched across the Hudson river in the  hope of checking the movement of British  vessels up that stream. In 1775 he built a  residence which tradition says sheltered  Lafayette as a headquarters during the rev-  olution. His first wife bore the name of  Mary. He married (second) Mary Wood,  who survived him and died at New Wind-  sor, February 3, 1807. Children : Samuel,  Timothy ; Hannah, married Joseph Dubois ;  Abigail, married Jonas ^\'illiams; Susannah,  married Moores.   (VII) General Timothy Brewster, second  son of Samuel Brewster, was born Novem-  ber 3, 1746, in New Windsor, and during  the revolution removed to Basking Ridge,  New Jersey, and later to W'oodbridge, same     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     state, where he occupied large tracts of land  bordering on Staten Island Sound, now  called Kill-von-Kull. About 1812 he re-  moved from Woodbridge, and in 1823 he  settled near Coldenham, Orange county.  New York, where he died in 1831. He was  elected elder of the Good Will church, and  was active in local affairs. He married  (first) October 17, 1774, Phebe Wood, of  Woodhaven, born February 17, 1754. He  married (second) Phebe Youngs, of Long  Island. Children: Samuel, born July 12,  1775; John, August 15, 1777; Mary, April  7, 1782, married Clark Noe, two children,  Catherine and Albert Noe, a well-known resi-  dent of Xcwburg; Betty, born P^ebruary 27,  1785, died in infancy; Nathaniel, born Octo-  ber 27, 1786; Timothy, mentioned below.   (VHI) Timothy (2), son of Timothy (i)  and Phebe (Wood) Brewster, was born  April 22, 1789, in Woodbridge, and died  May 2, 1836. He settled in Newburgh in  1831, and carried on a lumber business at  the foot of Fourth street. After his death  his family removed to West Troy, New  York, and remained two years, returning  again to Newburgh, where they have since  resided. He married, November 9, 1813,  Juliet Wright. Children : Caroline, died  young; Mary, married Silas Martine, and  resided in Newburgh ; Richard W. ; Harriet ;  Eugene A., mentioned below ; Caroline, all  are now deceased.   (IX) Eugene Augustus, second son of  Timothy (2) and Juliet (Wright) Brew-  ster, was born April 13, 1827, in New York  City, and died December 14, 1898, in New-  burgh. His education was obtained in the  public schools, of Newburgh, including the  high school, where he was an assistant in-  structor in 1843. In the same year he en-  tered the law office of Hon. John W. Brown  and was admitted to practice as an attorney  and counsellor in 1848. In 1830 he formed  a partnership with Nathan Reeve, which  continued until 1855, and thereafter prac-  ticed independently until his death. He  served several terms as a member of the  board of almshouse commissioners, was  fourteen years a member of the board of  educatinn. and was a trustee of Washing-  ton's Headquarters. He drew up the orig-  inal charter of the city of Newburgh ; as-  sisted in the incorporation of the National     Bank of Newburgh and was its vice-presi-  dent. For more than thirty years he was  a vestryman of St. George's (Protestant  Episcopal) Church, and was four years a  warden. For many years he was a leading  lawyer of Orange county, and was promi-  nently connected with St. Luke's Hospital.  He was among the most liberal contributors  toward the establishment and support of  that institution. He married, June i, 1859,  Anna W., daughter of Rev. Dr. John Brown.  Of their children, two now survive, George  R., mentioned below, and Anna W., wife of  Eugene W. Harter, of New York City.   (X) George Richard, only surviving son  of Eugene A. and Anna W. (Brown) Brew-  ster, was born November 17, 1873, in New-  burgh, where he grew up and prepared for  college at Siglar's Preparatory College of  Newburgh, after which he entered Yale  University, graduating in 1894 with the de-  gree of Ph. B. Pursuing the study of law  in his father's ofifice, he was admitted to the  bar in 1896, and since that time has been  successfully engaged in the practice of his  profession in his native city, and in New  York and Westchester counties. He is a  member of the Democratic, Yale and Trans-  portation clubs of New York, and a director  of the City Club of Newburgh. He is a  warden of St. George's Church, and is a  director in numerous local corporations, in-  cluding the National Bank of Newburgh,  for which he is attorney. He is also largely  interested in the breeding of hacking horses,  and maintains for that purpose one of the  finest farms in this state.   He married, January 18, 1899, Margaret  Copley Orr. daughter of the late James Orr,  of Newburgh.     Like a large proportion  VAN CLEFT of the Dutch names in   New York, this is de-  rived from a place. The /Vmerican ancestor  came from the village of Cleef in the Neth-  erlands, hence the name Van (from) Cleef.  The name has many other forms in the  early Dutch records of New York, such as  Van Clyf, Van ClyfT, Van Clvft. Vander  Clyft— Cleef— Cleeft—Cleyft. The name has  been prominently identified with the busi-  ness interests and general development of     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     the state of New York down to the present  time.   (I) Jan Van Cleef, born 1628, came to  New Amsterdam (New York) in 1653, and  was a farmer at Gravesend on Long Island,  in 1656. In 1659 he resided at New Utrecht  in the same vicinity, and was in BushwicTi  in 1664. He received a deed December 23,  1662, from Albert Albertse Terhune of  twenty-four morgens of land in New  Utrecht, which he sold in 1669. He pur-  chased a pasture lot in New Utrecht, De-  cember 2'j, 1677, and owned lots Nos. 6, 7,  13 and 14 at Yellow Hoek (Bay Ridge). In  1677 he was a member of the New Utrecht  church; was constable of that town in 1678,  and took the oath of allegiance to the Eng-  lish government in 1687. He signed docu-  ments now in existence with a mark. He  was probably married before coming to New  York, as the records of the Dutch church  show that his son, Dirck, had a child bap-  tized in 1668. He married (second) before  March 10, 1681, Engelte, daughter of  Louwerens Pieterse. Children : Catherine,  baptized October 23, 1681 ; Benjamin, No-  vember 25, 1683; settled in New Jersey;  Joseph, settled in New Jersey; Angelica;  Ceytie, baptized May 13, 1688; Isebrant, of  whom further ; Nelke ; Cornelius, resided  in New Utrecht, Dirck, Rebecca. Probably  several of these were of the first marriage.   (II) Isebrant (also spelled in the records  Ysebrant and Eyzebrand), son of Jan Van  Cleef, resided in early life in New Utrecht,  where he was grand juror in 1699. He was  undoubtedly a child of the first marriage  since he must have been of age in 1699.  For some time he resided upon, or in the vi-  cinity of Staten Island, where he was wit-  ness to the baptism of a child, July 26, 1711,  and ultimately settled in Monmouth coun-  ty, New Jersey. The record of all his chil-  dren has not been found. He married in  Gravesend, Jannetie Aertse Vander Bilt,  baptized September 17, 1682, in New  Utrecht, granddaughter of Jan Aertsen  Vander Bilt, immigrant ancestor of all bear-  ing that name in New York. Jan Aertsen  Vander Bilt (from the Bilt) came from the  village of Bilt (Bilt meaning hill) in the  province of Utrecht, Holland, as early as  1650, to New Amsterdam. He married  (first) in New Amsterdam, February 6,     1650, Anneken Hendricks, from Bergen,  Norway, (second) Derber Cornelis, and  (third) December 16, 1681, Magdalena  Hanse, widow of Hendrick Jansen Spier of  Bergen, New Jersey. He resided at New  Amsterdam, Flatbush, and lastly at Ber-  gen, where he owned lands in 1694, and died  February 2, 1705.   Aris, son of Jan Aertsen Vander Bilt,  born about 165 1, died after 171 1. He mar-  ried, October 6, 1677, Hillagonde Remsen,  daughter of Rem Janse Vanderbeek. Their  children found of record are: Marretje,  baptized January 25, 1716, in New Y'ork ;  Benjamin, April 19, 1715, at Port Richmond,  Staten Island; Janneke, March 8, 1720, in  Freehold, and another of the name Benja-  min, January 7, 1724, in Freehold. It is  probable that the first Benjamin died in in-  fr.ncy.   (HI) Cornelius Van Cleft, undoubtedly a  son of Isebrant Van Cleef, was born about  1710, and resided on Staten Island, where  he married Sara Marschall. No record of  the marriage or her birth or parentage can  be found.   (IV) Jan, or John, son of Cornelius and  Sara (Marschall) Van Cleft, was baptized  April 26, 1736, in the Dutch church of Port  Richmond, Staten Island, and settled about  the time of his majority in the Minnisink  district, which included parts of the present  Orange county. New York, and of New  Jersey. He had five sons and one daugh-  ter. The sons were : John, Cornelius,  Jesse, Joseph, of whom further, and Benja-  min (twins). The daughter, whose name  has not been preserved, married an Ives.   (V) Joseph, son of John Van Cleft, was  born at Minnisink, where he lived. He was  by trade a millwright; died in 1814. He  married Elizabeth Dunning, who died Jan-  uary 27, 1848, and had two sons and four  daughters : Hector, Lewis, of whom further ;  Ann Eliza, Sarah, Jane, Katura.   (VI) Lewis, son of Joseph and Elizabeth  (Dunning) Van Cleft, was born March 4,  1805, at Minnisink, and died in July, 1870,  at New Windsor, Orange county, New  Y'ork. In early life he was employed in a  woolen mill at Phillipsburg, New York, and  after his marriage settled on a farm of one  hundred acres, which he purchased in the  town of New Windsor, Orange county,     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     there ending his days. He married in  Blooming Grove, same county, Henrietta  Woodruff Cooper, February 19, 1834. Chil-  dren: Henry, Joseph, of whom further;  Sarah E., Lewis A.   (V'H) Joseph (2), second son of Lewis  and Henrietta W. (Cooper) Van Cleft, was  born June 17, 1836, in New Windsor, and  attended the district schools of the neigh-  borhood until 1852. At the age of sixteen  years he was employed as a clerk in a hard-  ware store at Middlctown, New York, and  was subsequently engaged in the same ca-  pacity in New York City, and still later in  Kansas City, Missouri, where he remained  two years. In 1863 he settled at New-  burgh. New York, and established a hard-  ware and agricultural implement business,  having a partner. Three years later he pur-  chased the interest of his partner and con-  ducted the business alone until 1887. when  he was joined by his brother, Lewis A. Van  Cl'^t't, under the style of Joseph Van Cleft  & Company. In 1909 he purchased the in-  terest of his brother and soon after closed  out the business. Upon the organization  ot the Columbus Trust Company of New-  burgh in 1893, Mr. Van Cleft was chosen  vice- president, and since 1897 has been pres-  ident of the institution. This is one of the  institutions for jjromoting the business ad-  vancement of Newburgh in whose organiza-  tion Mr. Van Cleft was active. He has been  ar. extensive dealer in real estate in the city  and is now the owner of the Van Cleft  block, one of the most prominent structures  in the city. He was interested in the build-  ing of the Palatine Hotel in 1892-93 and a  director of the company when it was organ-  ized. Many of the financial interests of the  place owe something to Mr. Van Cleft's aid  and good business judgment. He is a mem-  ber of the American Reformed church and  of the Newburgh Bay and Highlands His-  torical Society, in whose work he takes a  deep interest. A man of genial nature, can-  did mind and most courteous demeanor, Mr.  \'an Cleft wins and holds friendship \vith  many of his contemporaries.   He married. May 5. i86(), Edwina Storey  Smith, youngest daughter of O. M. Smith,  a school teacher of pnmiinence in the Hud-  son River Valley, and a granddaughter of  Jonas Storey, a well known lawyer of early     days, in Newburgh. She died April 24,  1S91, leaving five children: Josephine, Ed-  win L., Augusta ^L, Alberta, Barclay.     This name is said to have been  REEVE of Welsh origin. It appears on  Long Island as early as 1660,  w hen Thomas and James Reeves settled at  Mattituck in the present town of Southold,  New York. Many descendants from a very  early date have used the name without the  final 's' and some in Orange county, New-  York, use the form Reeve. Certain it is  that those bearing the name have been peo-  ple of high respectability, much endeavor  and general worth in the communities  where they have resided. The family seems  to have been very patriotic in the war for  independence. In 1776 a company drafted  out of Colonel Perry's regiment was under  the command of Captain Paul Reeves and  had among its privates: Ishmael, James,  Luther, Jonathan and William Reeves.  Captain Paul Reeves held that rank in the  minutemen of Mattituck. He died in 1822  at the age of ninety years.   (I) Thomas Reeve arrived in Snuihuld.  New- York, about 1660, and in 1667 removed  to Southampton on the south side of the  i.->land, where he died, August 28, 1685. He  married Rebecca Davis of Southampton,  probably a daughter of Faulk Davis (a pio-  neer of that town) by his first marriage.  Children: John; Rebecca, born March i,  1676; Thomas, October 3, 1679; Hannah,  February 9, 1681 ; Abigail, September 22,  1684.   (II) James Reeve was undoubtedly a son  of Thomas Reeve by a former marriage,  which is not recorded in this country. He  resided in Mattituck in the town of South-  old, where he died in 1692-3, leaving sons:  James (2). mentioned below; Isaac, Thom-  as and Daniel; and daughters: Hannah and  Deborah.   (III) James (2), eldest son of Jatnes (i)  Reeve, resided in Mattituck, where he died  at the age of sixty years. Sons : James,  Selah, mentioned below ; Nathaniel and Ebe-  nczer.   (IV) Selah, second son of James (2)  Reeve, was born March 21. 1741, and died  at Newburg, New York, February 21, 1796.       e      ^'      ^'rfyr///,r- 9/, ,/r/: , r ■ // . '//,rrr     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     He was commissioned second lieutenant of  the Third Long Island Regiment, June 27,  1776, and after the occupation of the island  by the British forces he was obliged to flee  with his family and such of his property as  could be readily removed. These were  transported on a scow across Long Island  Sound, and he remained in Connecticut un-  til 1784, when he settled in the town of New-  burg, New York, about three miles north  of the then village of that name. A plain,  brown stone slab marks his resting place in  the old town cemetery. Another slab re-  cords that his wife, Katurah, born January  23, 1745, died January 21, 1829, surviving  him almost thirty-three years. His sons  were: James, Selah (2), mentioned below,  and Joseph.   (V) Selah (2), second son of Selah (i)  and Katurah Reeve, was born October 21,  1767, in Southold. and died at Newburg,  April II, 1837. He resided in early life in  Newburg and served as trustee of the vil-  lage. In 1797 he was a member of the fire  company and resigned the next year on his  removal to Hunting Grove on the Otterkill,  where he engaged in the milling business.  In 1802 he returned to Newburg and es-  tablished a new industry, that of manufac-  turing brown earthenware. At this time he  had a partner in the person of Nathan Burl-  ing, and soon after added crockery and glass  to the wares in which they dealt. Follow-  ing this Mr. Reeve was for many years en-  gaged in the freighting business. In 1814 in  association with Hiram Falls, he purchased  a store, dock and freight business at the  corner of Third and Water streets, New-  burg, and operated the sloops 'Patriot' and  'Washington'. In 1825 his sons, Christo-  pher and George, purchased the interest of  Mr. Falls and thereafter the business was  conducted under the name of Reeve & Sons.  In 1830 Selah Reeve retired from the busi-  ness and in 1832 it passed into the hands of  his son George. Selah Reeve was a mem-  ber of the board of trustees of the village of  Newburg in 1802, 1810, 1818-19-20-21 and  1828-29. From 1818 to 1821 inclusive, he  was president of the board. He married in  1795, at Newburg, Elizabeth Tusten Van  Duser, born 1776-7, died May 4, 1854. There  were eleven children; Millicent, Christo-  pher, Chas. F. v., Julia Ann, George, men-     tioned below ; Eliza, Jane, Nathan, Harriet  M., Mary E., and Selah.   (VI) George, son of Selah (2) and Eliza-  beth T. (Van Duser) Reeve, was born in  1800, at Newburg, and died October 31,  1854. For many years he was associated  with his father in business and with his  brothers succeeded to the business. For  some time before his death he lived a quiet  and retired life. In 1840 he built a mansion  on Grand street, Newburg, which is still oc-  cupied by his eldest daughter, Mrs. Mead.  The family were members of St. George's  Episcopal Church of which Mr. Reeve was  a vestryman. He married Caroline, daugh-  ter of Stephen Ingersoll, of Dutchess coun-  ty. Mr. and Mrs. Reeve were the parents  of three children : Maria W., mentioned be-  low ; Arianna Somerville and George Henry.  The last named died at the age of twenty  vears.   (VII) Maria AV., eldest daughter of  George and Caroline (Ingersoll) Reeve, is  the widow of Obediah Mead of New York  City. Mr. Mead was a member of the firm  of Ralph Mead & Company, importers of  sugar and tea, of New York City.     The Olcotts of Albany, New  OLCOTT York, descend in direct un-  broken male succession from  Thomas Olcott, the immigrant ancestor of  the Connecticut branch of the family, who  was among the first settlers of the town of  Hartford, and one of the founders of the  trade and commerce of the colony of Con-  necticut. He came from England with the  Winthrop Company in 1630. There is rea-  son to believe that he was one of the 'good-  ly company' of men, women and children,  who in June, 1635, left Newton and other  settlements in Massachusetts to plant a new  colony in the- Connecticut valley. They  came through the wilderness until they  reached the mouth of the Chicopee river,  near what is now Springfield, and followed  down the banks of the Connecticut to the  s])ot, where in the autumn before the settle-  ment was begun, which is now Hartford,  but then called Suckiange. Mr. Olcott had  been educated in England, was a merchant,  and brought with him the experience and  fruits of successful enterprise. In common  with Edward Hopkins, Richard Lord, \\'i\-     114     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     liam Whiting and others he engaged in  trade, for which the Connecticut was sup-  posed to afford great facilities, especially in  the traffic of furs. Mr. Olcott first located  himself on a lot on the east side of the pub-  lic, now State House, square. He subse-  quently became the purchaser of one of the  lots assigned to Edward Hopkins in the  original distribution of the town among the  first settlers. This lot comprised the whole  square, fronting on Main street and bounded  by Pearl, Trumbull and Asylum streets. On  the southeast corner he erected a dwelling  for his own occupation, which continued in  the family for several generations. Thomas  Olcott died in 1654, aged about forty-five  years. His wife, Abigail, died May 26, 1693,  aged seventy-eight years. Children : Thom-  as (2), of wiiom further ; Samuel ; John, bap-  tized Eel)ruary 3, 1639; I'^lizal^elh, Decem-  ber 7, 1643; Hannah.   (H) Thomas (2), son of Thomas (i) and  .Abigail Olcott, was born about 1635. There  seems to be no record of his death. It ap-  pears by the land records of Hartford that  lie lived to advanced age, and until the year  1719. A deed of land from him to his son,  Thomas Olcott (3), is dated February 14,  1719. His wife, Mary, died May 3, 1721, at  \\indsor, Connecticut. Children: i. Abi-  gail, died March 14, 1688, at Springfield,  Mas.sachusetts. 2. Mary. 3. Thomas (3),  of whom further. 4.

New York, January 24. i860, in the  one hundredth year of his age. He was edu-  cated in New England, but settled in Hudson.  Columbia county. New York, then a thriving  city with a large fleet of sea-going vessels,  largely engaged in the whaling industry,  that annually brought to the city many tons  of whalebone and many thousand barrels of  whale oil. In 1785 he engaged in the manu-     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     115     facture of cordage with Thomas Jenkins,  built a rope-walk six hundred feet in length,  and did an extensive business in the making  and wholesaling of rope of all kinds and  sizes. After the death of his partner he con-  tinued the business alone. He was a shrewd  and capable business man of energy and di-  rect purpose. The qualities that made his  own life a success were transmitted to his  posterity, as will be seen in the following  generations. His long and useful life ended  in Hudson, and covered a century which  saw the colonies emerge from dependencies  into a great united independent nation. The  second war with Great Britain and the war  with Mexico had terminated and he died  just as the nation was plunging into the  great civil war.   He married Deborah, daughter of Thom-  as and Deborah Worth, of Nantucket,  Massachusetts, June 7, 1794. Children: i.  Thomas Worth, of whom further. 2.

(VI) Thomas Worth, son of Josiah and  Deborah (W^orth) Olcott, was born in Hud-  son, New York, May 22, 1795, died March  23, 1880, in Albany. He was educated in  the Hvidson schools, and began his long and  successful career in finance as a clerk in the  Columbia Bank of Hudson, where he re-  mained two years. He rapidly grasped the  fundamental principles governing mone-  tary laws. His active mind and cjuick, de-  cisive character made him an unusually  valuable employee, and when the Mechan-     ics' and Farmers' Bank opened its doors for  business, July 29, 181 1, he was one of the  clerical force. On that date began his  remarkable connection with that institution,  a connection lasting nearly seventy years,  the last forty-four years of which were spent  in the president's chair. His rise was rapid.  Six years after the bank opened its doors  for business, he became cashier. Nineteen  years later, in June, 1836, he was elected  president. The Mechanics' and Farmers'  Bank, whose success in a large degree must  be, and is by general consent, credited to  the genius of Thomas Worth Olcott, was  the third bank incorporated in Albany, and  was chartered ostensibly for the benefit of  the mechanics and farmers of Albany coun-  ty. Its charter provided that none but me-  chanics and farmers should be elected as  bank officers, but some years later was  amended so as to authorize the president  and directors without reference to their oc-  cupation or business. It is a noted fact and  one that created considerable discussion and  comment that the entire first board of di-  rectors were Democrats. It had been un-  derstood that two Federalists would have a  place on the board, and they were later sub-  stituted. Thomas W. Olcott was the fifth  president, and at his death he was succeeded  by his son Dudley, who is the present in-  cumbent (1910).   The first period of the bank's history end-  ed by the expiration of charter in 1833. At  the expiration of the second charter in 1853  the bank closed up its affairs, when the  stockholders received one hundred and fif-  teen per cent., besides their stock in the  new bank, which renewed the charter for  twenty years and went into operation again  with the same officers. During the civil  war the hank closed up its affairs and re-  organized in 18^5 under the national bank-  ing laws, having previously operated as a  state bank. In 1868 they again chartered  under state bankingr laws, abandoning tlie  national system. The career of the bank  has been one of unvarying prosperity, ex-  cept only a short period in 1817 when the  capital became impaired, owing to the finan-  cial trouble growing out of depression fol-  lowing the war with Great Britain in 1812-  14. In 1855 the Mechanics' and Farmers'  Savings Bank was incorporated with Thorn-     n6     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     as W. Olcott as the first president, succeed-  ed in 1880 by his son Dudley.   While Mr. Olcott was eminently the man  of affairs and held a position in the financial  world second to none and was recognized  as a great banker, his obligation to his city  as a citizen did not rest lightly upon him.  He was an active, as well as a leading mem-  ber of the boards of several of the public  charitable and educational associations that  have made Albany famous. His private  benevolences were many and cannot be re-  corded ; his public service can. He was vice-  president of the first board of directors of  .Mbany Law School, organized in 1851, the  fourth' school of its kind in the United  States. In 1833 he was elected president of  the board, continuing until his death in 1880.  He was president of the first board of di-  rectors of Dudley Observatory, a scientific  institution founded through the munificence  of Mrs. Blandina Dudley, widow of Charles  E. Dudley, with the co-operation of leading  citizens of Albany. The observatory prof-  ited greatly through the generosity of Mr.  Olcott and his sons, the latter furnishing the  funds for refitting Olcott Meridian Circle  (named for its donor), housing it in a suit-  able building and remounting it on the new  site. He was president of the Albany Agri-  cultural and Arts Association ; president of  Albany Hospital, in which he took a deep  and lasting interest; trustee and president  of Albany Girls' Academy ; trustee of the  Boys' .Vcademy ; president of Albany Ceme-  tary .Association. In addition to these in-  stitutions, all of which he served faithfully,  giving largely of his rare executive ability  and unerring judgment, his purse was ever  open for all good causes, earning him the  title of the 'most charitable man in Albany.'  Returning to liis business life he was  president of the Albany & West Stock-  bridge Railroad Company, afterwards merged  into the Boston & Albany system, and later  trustee of the sinking fund commission, ap-  pointed to retire the bonds issued by the  city of Albany to aid in the construction of  the road. The retirement of these bonds  was successfully accomplished under the  guidance of Mr. Olcott, and is still referred  to as the 'greatest piece of financiering ever  accomplished in Albany.' When Secretary  Chase wH'; perfecting plans for a national     bank system he held frequent interviews  with Mr. Olcott and was largely guided by  his wise counsel. In 1863 he declined a  flattering offer from President Lincoln of  the position of first comptroller of the cur-  rency, and declined all public ofifice except  such as related to the promotion of educa-  tion or other local interest. During his  business life he developed a wonderful qual-  ity of quick, decisive action. Strong in his  opinions, yet he was always open to convic-  tion and ready to accept the views of oth-  ers. His ability to judge human nature and  read men was another marked quality. His  courage was another attribute that rendered  him conspicuous; nothing daunted him. and  failure was a word with which he was un-  acquainted. He was identified with the  Christian life of Albany as member and  trustee of the Second Presbyterian Church.  His political life was inconspicuous. In  early life and up to i860 he was a Democrat ;  then for the remainder of his life a Repub-  lican. He W'as strongly Union in his senti-  ments, and served on the committee having  in charge the recruiting and equipping of  the One Hundred and Thirteenth New  York Regiment (Seventh Regiment, New  York \'olunteer Artillery). His only other  public ofifices that can be construed as politi-  cal were his position as bridge commissioner  to select the site of the lower bridge across  the Hudson at South Ferry street, and his  appointment to the state board of regents.  His home in Albany was in the midst of a  plot of about three acres of ground and  there he gratified his love for flowers and  plants to the fullest extent and spent his  hours of leisure in their cultivation. He was  quiet, unostentatious and domestic in his  tastes and habits, giving little evidence of  being the wealthy and distinguished finan-  cier. He died at his home in Albany in his  eighty-fifth year, continuing his active busi-  ness life until his last illness.   He married Caroline, daughter of Daniel  Pepoon, of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, .Xu-  gust 17, 1818. She died March 12, 1867.  Children: i. Frederick Worth, born Au-  •gust 10, 1820, died November 2, 1822. 2.  Thomas, December 31, 182 1, died August  27, 1873: married (first) April 3. 1844.

Dudley, of  whom further. 11. Frederick Pepoon, of  whom further.   (VII) Dudley, son of Thomas Worth and  Caroline (Pepoon) Olcott, was born in Al-  bany, New York, September 21, 1838. He  was educated in the Albany Boys' Acad-  emy, and afterwards attended the Rensse-  laer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, where  he took a course in civil engineering. In  1858 he became connected with the Mechan-  ics' and Farmers' Savings Bank of Alljany,  as accountant. This position he held for  seven years, when he became assistant cash-  iei' of the Mechanics' and Farmers' Bank,  and later cashier. For thirteen years he  was cashier of this bank, until December  31, 1878, when he was chosen vice-president  dent. In March, 1880, he was elected presi-  dent, succeeding his father. Under his wise  and able management the bank has contin-  ued its successful life, and is one of the  strong, conservative financial institutions of  the state. He is thoroughly versed in the  laws governing finance, is devoted to the  institution over which he presides, and is  recognized everywhere as one of the clear-  est-headed and ablest financiers of the state.  He was at one time president of the Albany  Bankers' Association, and represented the  Mechanics' and Farmers' Bank in the lead-  ing bank associations of the country. In  1861 he toured Europe, since which time his  service has been continuous, saving only his  annual summer vacation, which is spent in  Canada. The connection of the Olcotts, fa-  ther and son, now covers the period of a  full century, 1811-1911. Seventy-five of  these years have seen them occupying the  president's chair. This is both a wonderful  and unusual record, and probably un-  equalled in point of continuous ser\'ice.   Mr. Olcott has no outside business in-     terests, although he is devoted to the wel-  fare of many of the leading public institu-  tions of Albany. He is a member of the  board of governors of the Albany Hospital,  president of the Albany Cemetery Associa-  tion, trustee of the Home for Aged Men,  trustee of the Albany Orphan Asylum, trus-  tee of the Albany Academy for Girls, and  aids other good causes by his influence and  liberality. He served his state one term as  paymaster-general, appointed by Governor  Fenton in 1867. He served the city of Al-  bany as park commissioner, was treasurer  and later president of the commission dur-  ing its entire existence. Politically he is a  Republican, but his devotion to business pre-  cludes all idea of public atTairs. He is a  member of the Fort Orange and Country  clubs, Albany, and of the Metropolitan Un-  ion League and Down Town clubs, of New  York City. He is fond of the solitude of  the great woods, and for the past thirty-one  years has spent each summer vacation at  Restigouche river, Canada, where his favor-  ite sport, salmon fishing, is his daily occu-  pation. Mr. Olcott's home is the old fam-  ily mansion in Albany, in the midst of the  beauties created and loved by his father,  which he perpetuates and continues in lov-  ing remembrance. He is unmarried.   (\TI) Frederick Pepoon, son of Thomas  Worth and Caroline (Pepoon) Olcott, was  Ijorn in Albany, New York, February 23,  1841, and died at his home, 'Round Top,'  near Bernardsville, New Jersey, April 15,  1909. Upon graduation from the Albany  Academy he entered the bank of which his  father was president and there secured the  training and knowledge in financial matters  which characterized his business career, and  placed him in the highest rank of modern  conservative financial men. For a time he  was engaged in the lumber business, also a  partner with Blake Brothers & Company,  liankers and brokers. In 1882 he accepted  the nomination and was elected comptroller  of the state of New York, which position  he occupied for a term of two years. In  1884 he declined the Democratic nomination  for governor, and accepted the presidency  of the Central Trust Company, of New  York City, where he remained until 1905 ;  retiring in that year on account of ill-health  to his favorite residence and farm, 'Round     ii8     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     'lop,' Bernardsville, New Jersey. In addi-  tion to his connection with the Central  Trust Company Mr. Olcott was president  oi the Galveston, Houston & Henderson  railroad, a director of the Delaware, Lacka-  wanna & Western railroad and other rail-  roads, of the Bank of America, and of the  iMorristown Trust Company of New Jer-  sey.   Personally Mr. Olcott was known as a  man of broad, philanthropic tendencies, tak-  ing personal interest in the political and  social welfare of the community, and ever  ready to assist those less successful in the  battle of life. A few years before his death  he provided an endowment of fifty thou-  sand dollars for the Albany Academy. He  was greatly interested in horticulture, and  his gardens were famous for the production  of choice plants and rare flowers. He was  also a breeder of trottinsj horses. Mr. Ol-  cott was a member of the Union League,  New York Yacht, Metropolitan, Manhattan  and Down Town clubs, of New York, and  of the Morristown Club.   Mr. Olcott married Mary Esmay, by  whom he is survived, together with chil-  dren: Diftlley, of whom further; and one  daughter.   (VHI) Dudley (2), son of Frederick P.  and Mary (Esmay) Olcott, was born in  New York City, May 14, 1874. He was edu-  cated in his place of birth, and his business  career has been conducted in connection  witii the Central Trust Company. He now  resides in Morristown, New Jersey. Mr.  Olcott has taken membership in the follow-  ing clubs : Metropolitan, Tuxedo, Morris  County Golf, New York Athletic, Morris-  tnwn, Whippany River, Automobile of  America, and Grolier.   He married, at Bernardsville, New Jer-  sey, August 18, 1903, Sarah Crozer L. Le-  vick, born at Philadelphia. March 10, 1875,  daughter of Thomas Bowin and Elizabeth  Shippen Buckley (Grubb) Levick. Chil-  dren of Dudley (2) Olcott: Gladys Grubb,  horn at New York City, December 29, 1905 ;  Jeanette Grubb. Morristown, New Jersey.  May 7,0, 1907.     This old Dutch name  \'AN DEUSEN is derived from a ham-  let of about five hun-     dred people in Noord Brabant or North Bra-  bant, Holland, called Deursen. The immi-  grant ancestor of the family came from  Deurse, the 'Van' being used in the ordi-  nary sense of 'from,' indicating that the  immigrant ancestor or the original ancestor  who first bore the surname that became  hereditary to his descendants came from  that place. It was thus that the surname  arose, as is the case in a great number of  Dutch surnames in this country. Previous  to arrival in America the Dutchman was  usually designated by the baptismal name  of his father with the affi.x 'sen'' attached,  and it was a universal custom for one hun-  dred and fifty years to use the father's name  as a middle name among the Dutch fami-  lies. This usage has made it possible to  trace many lines that would otherwise be  undiscoverable.   (I) Matthew or Teuwis Abrahamse Van  Deusen, immigrant ancestor of the Van  Deusen family, was born in Holland, and  was one of five brothers, sons of Abraham  \'an Deusen, who came to America about  the middle of the seventeenth century. The  names of the five sons of Abraham Van  Deusen were : Lsaac, Melchert, Matthew,  Jacob, Peter. Matthew resided in the vil-  lage of Beverwyck (Albany) in 1659, and  he was the owner of a lot there from 1656  to 1667. This lot had a frontage of thirty-  five feet on Broadway, extending back to  James street. December, 1677, I^aulus .Mar-  tense Van Benthuysen conveyed by deed  to Harme Janse Lyndrayer the same prop-  erty in Rensselaerwyck formerly conveyed  to him by Mattheus Abrahamse Van Deu-  sen. by deed declared June 26. 1677. This  property was situated in the city of Albany  on the west side of and fronting on Broad-  way, north of Maiden Lane, extending back  to that street and lying between Maiden  Lane and Steuben street. At a sale in  Albany, July 5. 1664, he purchased a cow  for one hundred and eighteen florins. For  the payment of this sum Cornells Teunisse  Bos went his surety and principal, and Mat-  thew on his part pledged himself as surety  for Cornelius Bos on the same day for the  payment of one hundred and twelve florins  for the purchase of the running works of a  horse mill. Matthew was still living in Al-  bany in 1700, and no record of his death     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     iiy     appears. His wife bore the name of Helena.  Children: i. Lysbet (Elizabeth), married  Johannes Benson, February 2, 16S0; died in  1746. 2. Robert, mentioned below. 3.  Tryntje (Catherine), married Samson Ben-  son about 1673. 4. Jan, married Maritje  Martense Van Buren, March 14, 1695. 5.  Isaac, married Bata Van Ysselsteyn, Octo-  ber 9, 1706. 6. Helena, married Harpert  Van Deusen, November 7, 1707.   (H) Robert, eldest son of Matthew or  Teuwis Abrahamse and Helena \'an Deu-  sen, was a resident of Claverack, Columbia  county. New York, in 1720, and probably  spent most of his life in that town. He  married (first) about 1689, Cornelia Mar-  tense, daughter of Martin Cornelis and  Maritje \'an Buren, who probably died be-  fore 1718. His brother, Jan, married Mar-  itje Alartense, the sister of Cornelia Martense  Van Buren. He married (second) August  21. 1718, Gertruyd Van Benthuysen. In the  will of Martin Cornelis \'an Buren, of Rens-  selaerwyck Colony, registered April 10,  1710. he devised his property to his daugh-  ter, Cornelia Martense, wife of Robert Van  Deusen. Children of Robert and Cornelia  Martense (Van Buren) Van Deusen: i.  Johannes, born July 13, 1690; married  Styntje (Christina) Van Alen, August 16,  1712. 2. Mattheus, born November i, 1691,  died before 1756. 3.

(IV) James, son of Robert (2) and Chris-  tina (Roorbach) Van Deusen, was baptized  September 30, 1733, at Germantown, Colum-  bia county. New York. He owned a farm  about a mile north of Johnstown, Columbia  county, New York, on the road leading to  Hudson, and another farm at West Tagh-  kanie. The latter farm he gave to his son  Nicholas. The Johnstown farm he gave to  his son, Robert, which farm was afterwards  owned by Henry du Bois (in 1894 by Aus-  tin Hodskins). James Van Deusen and his  wife are buried on this farm, near the old  hay barn. A Bible record owned by Mrs.  Mary E. Briggs-Kells, of Sheffield, Massa-  chusetts, gives the date of his death as June   7, 1820. James Van Deusen was a man of  unusual strength and vigor and exceeding-  ly tall. On account of his height he was  called 'Foyer' by the members of his fam-  ily. He died very suddenly at the home of  his son, Nicholas Van Deusen, on the farm  at West Taghkanie, Columbia county. New  York, his dead body being found in his bed  by the family slave, named Dunn. His wife,  Elizabeth, daughter of Jonas Smith, origi-  nally Smidt, who came from Germany, and  settled at Johnstown, became blind in the  latter years of her life ; she died at the home  of her son, Robert, near Johnstown.

As a young man looking about to se-  cure a position to better himself, he fur-  nished a man to assist his father in his store  and undertook the teaching of a school in  the neighborhood where he was born. He  afterwards served as a clerk in the store of  Forrest & \'an Deusen at Johnstown. He  entered into the flour mill and general mer-  chandise business with Abram F. Miller as  partner in the town of Ancram. When Mr.  Miller retired from business Mr. Van Deu-  sen secured the store and mill on Punch  brook, built by Livingstone in 1775, which  was situated at Scotchtown. Afterwards as  a result of exposure his health failed to  .such a degree as to incapacitate him for  business. He married Catherine Best. Chil-  dren: I. Edwin Holmes, mentioned below.  2. Margaret Ann, born July 27, 1830. 3.  Ellen, born September 20, 1832, married  William Pierson Ilazleton, of Tarrytown,  New York.   (VH) Dr. Edwin Holmes Van Deusen,  son of Robert Nicholas and Catherine  (Best) Van Deusen, was born August 29,  1828, in Columbia county. New York, died  in 1910. at Livingston, New York. He was  educated at Williams College, graduating in  the class of 1848. He attended the College  of Physicians and Surgeons in New York  City, and graduated in the class of 1850. In  1853 he was appointed first assistant physi-  cian at the State Lunatic Asylum, Utica.  New York. In 1855 he was appointed su-  pcrmtendent of the Michigan State Asylum     at Kalamazoo, where he remained as super-  intendent for the next twenty years. He  retired owing to failing health and lived in  Kalamazoo until a short time before his  death, which occurred at Goshen, New  York. He was an active churchman and  vestryman of the Presbyterian church, and  he was also a member of the State Board of  Charities and Corrections, Michigan. Dr.  \'an Deusen belonged to the Free Mason  Society, being a member of the Lodge at  Utica, New York. He married Cynthia,  daughter of John T. and Cynthia ( \'an  Slyck) Wendover, of Stuyvesant Landing,  New York, in 1858. They had two chil-  dren, a daughter who died in infancy, and  Robert Thompson, mentioned below.   (VllI) Robert Thompson, only son of  Dr. Edwin Holmes and Cynthia (\\'end-  over) \*an Deusen, was born at Kalamazoo,  Michigan, April 26, 1859. He was educated  in Kalamazoo, and spent his life there until  tlie age of twenty. At that age he began  to travel and has kept on doing so up to the  present time. He has been a member of the  Holland Society and of the Society of the  Sons of the American Revolution, but re-  signed some time ago. He married, June  6, 1899, at Hartford, Connecticut, Harriet  Louise Mosher, of Albany county. New  York, daughter of Leonard Mosher. Chil-  dren : Harriet Huj'ck, born in 1900, and  Robert ^\'., born in 1903.     Of this surname in its English  ROE forms of Row and Rowe is said by   Lower to be possibly derived from  the word 'row', applied to a street or rather  a detached row of houses. In some cases,  he thinks, it may be derived from a parish  of the same name in Dumbartonshire, Scot-  land. Or again he thinks it may be taken  from the Gaelic word 'rhu', signifying a  low, detached, narrow peninsula. Rowe  without any prefix is found in the Hundred  Rolls of England. The name has also been  fancifully derived from Roo or Rollo, the  famous leader of the Danes in the ninth  century. Whatever may be said about the  English name of Rowe. however, there is  no question concerning the derivation of the  patronymic of the Roe families of Ireland  who have in many cases preserved their  pedigrees n\cr a period of two thousand     I     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     years. The Roes of Ireland are a branch  of the O'Neills of Tyrone, who were mon-  archs of Ireland for over five hundred years,  Princes of Tyrone, and Kings of Ulster.  The name itself is taken from Niall Ruadh  ('ruadh' in Irish or Gaelic means 'red',  applied to a warrior with red flowing locks),  who is one hundred and eleven on the pedi-  gree of the O'Neills of Ulster, and the chief  ancestor of the Roe family. The old form  of the name in Gaelic was O'Ruaiadh, and  has been anglicised into Rowe and Roe, 'd'  when followed by an aspirate in Gaelic re-  maining silent. This Niall Ruadh was a  Prince of Ulster, and was married to Nuala,  who died in 1226. the daughter of Roderic  O'Cnncubhair or O'Conor. the hundred and  eighty-third monarch of Ireland. The son  of Niall Ruadh was Brian Catha Dun, in the  direct line of the Roes, who is reckoned as  the one hundred and eighty-fourth monarch  of Ireland. Under the date A. D. 1258 the  'Annals of the Four Masters' says of this  Brian : 'Hugh, the son of Felim O'Conor  and Teige O'Brian, marched with a great  force to Caol Uisge (near the present New-  ry) to hold a conference with Brian O'Neill,  to whom the foregoing chiefs granted the  sovereignty over the Irish, and they agreed  that the hostages of Hugh O'Conor should  be given to him as sureties for the fulfiH-  ment of tliis compact, and the hostages of  the O'Reilly's people and also those of the  Hy-Bruin, from Kells to DrumclifT, should  be likewise given to Hugh, the son of Felim  O'Conor.' After tliis Brian's death on the  battlefield of Drom Deirg at Dunleathglas  (now Downpatrick), commanding the Irish  forces against the English, he was succeed-  ed in the Principality of Ulster by the cele-  brated Hugh Buidhe, son of Donal Oge, son  of Hugh Dubh, the ancestor of the O'Neills  of Clanaboy.

Some etymologists hold that the name was  originally Tournoire, meaning 'black tower,'  a connection by which perhaps some well  known landmark endowed the ancestral fam-  ily with its name. Another possible origin is  the term 'tourneour', Norman French for one  who took part in a tournament. In a mediae-  val controversy respecting the right of bearing  arms. Azure a bend or, it was testified that  Monsire le Scrope was in his time le plus fort  tourneour de tout notrc pays, translated, 'the  bravest tourneyer of all our country.' One  witness testified moreover that he always wore  the blue with the golden bend, as did his kins-  man, Goefifrey le Scrope, when he tourneyed  at the various tournaments. The Tourneurs  or Turnures of New York were one of some  thirty French families, about a third of whom  were from Picardy, who made their home in  Harlem in the seventeenth century. Of Pic-  ard descent were the Tourneurs or Turnures,  Cressons, Demarests, Casiers and Disosways,  members of all of which except the last served  as magistrates. The Turnure family has al-  ways played an influential part in the history  of state and nation. Some of its members  have been men of the highest repute in public,  professional and commercial life.     126     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     (1) Deacon Daniel Tourneur or de Tour-  neur, immigrant ancestor of most of those in  America bearing the name or its variations,  was born at Amiens in Picardy, France, about  1025, died at Harlem, New York, in 1673.  Being charged with the death of Tilic Alaire,  whom he had killed in self-defence during a  brawl occasioned by the religious quarrels of  the period, he left France, going through Bel-  gium to Holland. He finally halted at Ley-  den, and settling down pursued for a time the  business of draper, eventually marrying. Al-  most two years later Tourneur sailed with his  wife and infant son for New Netherland in  America, probably in the ship with Dr. Samuel  Drisius, of Leyden, which left Holland April  4, 165Z. Jean le Roy, a kinsman of Tourneur,  appears to have accompanied him with his  wife, Louise de Lancaster. On coming here  he first lived at I'^lathush where a daughter  was born, who died in infancy. Here Tour-  neur, with some military prestige it would  seem, was made corporal of a company formed  April 7, 1654, for protection against maraud-  ers. Soon after he was granted a lot in New  Amsterdam, with a view to putting up a house,  but a year or more passing before the timber  was ready he renewed his request, April 11,  1657, for leave to build. He afterwards built  a house on the Prince's draft, where he bought  a lot, May 31, 1660, and on August 16 of the  same year was appointed a magistrate for  Harlem. He probably continued in business  at New Amsterdam, as on October 15 ensuing  he was made one of the 'sworn butchers'.  The next winter he put up a barn on his vil-  lage plot at Harlem, where he had already  built a house, and whither he soon removed,  serving in the magistracy at various periods  ajid serving also for several years as deputy  sheriff. He was repeatedly chosen deacon, be-  si<lcs which he was a delegate to the general  assembly of 1664. and also one of the Nicholls  patentees. He left a goodly estate. He mar-  ried.

(11) Deacon Jacques Tourneur, son of  Deacon Daniel and Jacqueline (Parisis) Tour-  neur, was born at Harlem about 1655, died  about 1720. He served as deacon and also as  constable and overseer of the town, succeed-  ing in 1 691 to that part of his father's lands  on Van Keulen's Hook known as lots 17 and  1 8,' but in quantity three lots, and since the  Bussing or Storm farm. He bought August  7. 1 69 1, from Peter van Obliensis, for six  hundred gl.. the old Jacques Cresson residence,  which became his home.

After leaving school  Mr. Turnure engaged in mercantile and finan-  cial afifairs showing great initiative and energy.  He was for several years connected with bank-  ing companies, occupying responsible posi-  tions. For a long time he was associated with  Moses Taylor, a well known merchant and  banker of New York, and much of Mr. Tay-  lor's success, in the various undertakings in  which he engaged, was due to the great ability  of his partner. Subsequently Mr. Turnure  founded the great banking firm of Lawrence  Turnure & Company, of which he was many  years the head. Mr. Turnure was a member  of the Tuxedo, ALinhattan and Democratic  clubs, the Downtown Association, the Ameri-  can Geographical Society, and many of the  leading artistic and benevolent organizations  of the city.

SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Dcstfiulants of Henry Mel-  CA.M.MANN cliior Muhlenberg, the Penn-  sylvania minister, are numer-  ous, and among them are members of the  Cammann family. Genealogical and heraldic  works in (k-rmany state that the von Muhlen-  bcrgs were recognized before the Thirty  Years' War, 1618-48, as among the baronial  families of the empire, and that they derive  their origin from Ziracka, a prince of the  Wendish and Sorbic tribes, who about the  year 950 A. D. was converted to Christianity,  and iiad his residence near the present Muhl-  enberg, on the right bank of the Ell)e river, in  the Merseburg district of Prussian Saxony.  In the neighborhood of this town Muhlenberg  the electoral prince, John Fride, after an un-  fortunate battle fell, April 24, 1547, into the  hands of the Emperor Charles V. Mills  Oiiuhlen in German) erected in that locality  gave name to the town and subsequently to  the family residing there, which increased and  in course of time acquired large possessions  in Saxony, Austrian Silesia and other parts.  In the escutcheon of the family were two  wheels, and the members of the family signed  themselves 'of the Muhlenberg'. Various  members of the family made themselves emi-  nent in war and peace, and in the beginning  of the sixteenth century the family was still  counted among the prominent and wealthy.  During the wars of the sixteenth century and  especially the Thirty Years' War some of its  branches died out, and others were reduced in  circumstances. After the middle of the sev-  enteenth century the name is no longer found  on rolls of nobles of the empire, and the fam-  ily never made any attempt to have their title  acknowledged and entered by the imperial  court of heraldry in Vienna.   (I) Rev. Henry Melchior Muhlenberg, im-  migrant ancestor of the family of that name,  as well as of the branch of the Cammann fam-  ily here dealt with, was born at Eimbeck, in  tlie kingdom of Hanover, Germany, Septem-  ber 6, 171 1, (lied at Trappe, Pennsylvania, Oc-  tober 7, 1787, aged seventy-six years. His  father died while he was quite young, and at  an early period he had to rely on his own  exertions as a teacher for support. He en-  tered the University of GiJttingen March 19,  1735, and made rapid progress in his studies.  In 17.^7 he was received into the theological  seminary, and after graduating thence entered     the University of Halle for the purpose of  fitting himself more worthily for the ministry.  About 1740 the early Lutheran settlers of  Pennsylvania having become tired of those  who officiated among them as clergymen, and  whom they described as impostors, wrote to  the professors of the University of Halle for  a regularly ordained and commissioned min-  ister to take charge of the feeble flocks. For  this purpose Mr. Muhlenberg was selected.  Accordingly in the spring of 1742 he left Halle  for London. From there he embarked, and  after a perilous voyage landed, September 22,  at Charleston, South Carolina, whence he  journeyed to Philadelphia, arriving November  25. Three days later he preached his first  sermon at the swamp in New Hanover town-  ship. He found but three organized Lutheran  congregations ; one at Philadelphia, one at  Trap])e and one at New Hanover. The last  congregation had a log church and one hun-  dred and twenty members. At Trajjpe there  were about fifty members, who worshipped in  a barn. Churches were soon built and during  his labors they prospered abundantly. His  services were divided between the three con-  gregations and, as may be supposed, were  very arduous, requiring him to travel in regu-  lar journeys many miles through the wilder-  ness on horseback. In 1745 he received the  assistance of several other brethren, who ar-  rived as pastors and teachers from Germany.  After his marriage in 1745 he settled immedi-  ately at Trap]ie, where he continued to reside  till October, 1761, when he moved to Philadel-  phia to take charge of the church there. In  1776 he returned again to Trappe to take  charge of the congregation, and there con-  tinued to reside for the remainder of his life.  He was buried in the Trappe graveyard, where  also repose the remains of several members of  his family. He has been styled by several  writers the father of the Lutheran church in  America, and also the first regularly ordained  minister sent here. However, long before he  was born, the Swedes had built Lutheran  churches and had regularly ordained minis-  ters, not only in Pennsylvania, but in several  of the adjoining states. Mr. Muhlenberg  knew Latin, German, Dutch and English well,  besides having a knowledge of several other  languages. He married. April 30, 1745.

SOUTHERN NEW YORK     This surname, if English in ori-  BIRCH gin, may be derived in some cases  from the tree bearing the name.

The family bearing this sur-  \'.\XAMEE name is Holland Dutch in  origin and the name was orig-  inally spelled with an additional 'a'. and with-  mit the final 'e' \'an Naame. The fam-  ily was of early settlement on Staten  Island, New York. It was one of the  oldest of the Dutch families of that coun-  ty, though not the oldest. The earliest men  lion of the name occurring in a church record  is as follows : 'Evert and Wyntie ( Wilhel-  mina) Benham had a son Joseph, baptized  A])ril 22, 1709, and a daughter August 3,  1718'. There is another record in the public  archives at Kingston, Ulster county. New  York, to the effect that Jochem \'an Namee  was a trustee of the freeholders and common-  alty of the town of Kingston in 1695. Accord-  ing to such tradition as comes down to us it  would seem that this Jochem was the immi-  grant ancestor. The available evidence points  in the same direction, for it is clear, among  other things, that Jochem must have been a  man well on in judgment and years to have  been made the holder of a position in the pub-  lic affairs of the town usually filled by men of  responsible station and of mature years.   ( I) Jochem Englebert Van Naame, the pro-  genitor of the well known family of New  York bearing the name, was born probably in  Holland, and died at Kingston, Ulster county.  New York, after the year 1695. He was a  trustee of the freeholders and commonalty of  the town of Kingston in 1695. He probably  engaged in farming chiefly as an occupation,  the work at that early date in that region be-     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     ing almost exclusively of the pioneer kind,  clearing and cultivating the ground and build-  ing up an ordered community. Nevertheless  he seems to have been a man of education and  character, possessing a certain recognized po-  sition among the members of the municipality  in which he lived. He married Lysbeth Pels.  Children : Evert, who married \V'yntie Ben-  ham, having a son Joseph, baptized April 2:,  1709, and a daughter, who was baptized Au-  gust 3, 1718 ; Simon, mentioned below.   (II) Simon, son of Jochem Englebert and  Lysbeth (Pels) Van Naame, was born about  the year 1685. He was a farmer, though fol-  lowing in his father's footsteps in so far as  his interest in general public affairs extended.  He married Sarah Prall. Children : Aaron,  mentioned below ; Moses.   (III) Aaron \'an Namee (the name changed  to its modern form about this time), son of  Simon and Sarah ( Prall) Van Naame, was  born August 17, 1718. There is no record giv-  ing his occupation or any details concerning  his life. He ijrobably followed the occupation  of both his father and grandfather, devoting  most of his time to the cultivation of the land  and to the construction of houses and their  appurtenances. In those days a man had to  be a master of many trades, involving both the  development of properties and the transactions  or barter connected with their passage from  one hand to another. Aaron \'an Namee mar-  ried Mary McLean, thus signalizing the grad-  ual mixture of the old Dutch with the other  and somewhat later elements in that region,  coming from the British Isles. Their children  were : Aaron, Simon, mentioned below ; Wil-  liam, Ann. Moses, Charles.   (IV) Simon (2), second son of Aaron and  Mary (McLean) Van Namee, was born some-  where between 1740 and 1750, died after 1790.  He was engaged for the most part in agricul-  tural pursuits and settled in Norway, Herki-  mer county. New York. He married, but the  name of his wife does not appear in any rec-  ord. He was numbered in the census of 1790,  and there he is stated to have five sons and  two daughters, the names of three of the sons  being .Aaron. Stephen. John, mentioned below.   (V) John, son of Simon (2) Van Namee,  was born in Norway, Herkimer county. New  York, about the year 1785, died in Ogdens-  burg. New York. The name of his wife is  not known.     SOUTHERN NEW Y(3RK     133     (VI) Simon (3), son of John Van Namee,  was born at Ogdensburg, New York, in 1814,  died at Kingston, New York. He was a phy-  sician by profession and practiced for a num-  ber of years in Albany and Kingston, in both  of which places he was well known. He mar-  ried Anna, daughter of a Mr. Graham, who  belonged to a family that had come originally  from Scotland.   (VH) William Vanamee, son of Simon (3)  and Anna (Graham) Van Namee, was born in  Albany, Albany county. New York, January  9, 1847. While he was yet a child his parents  removed from Albany to Kingston, Ulster  county, New York, where he received an edu-  cation at the Kingston Academy. In 1886  Hamilton College conferred on him the degree  of Master of Arts. When he was nineteen he  went to Middletown, Orange county, New  York, for the purpose of studying law with  Judge Groo. Two years after he was admitted  to practice at the general term of the supreme  court, held at Poughkeepsie, Dutchess county.  New York, in May, 1868. He began the prac-  tice of the law in Middletown, Orange county,  and he remained there until 1895, when he re-  moved to Newburg. He was in active prac-  tice and associated in the trial of many im-  portant cases during his entire professional life  until 1906 when trouble with his eyes caused  his retirement from trial work. Mr. Vanamee  during this period was frequently called to  other counties as counsel in the trial of im-  portant cases. Some idea of the scope and  character of his work may be gathered from  the report of a trial which appeared in the  Nezvhurg Journal on the 12th day of Novem-  ber, 1903, in which it is said: 'The jury was  addressed for the plaintiff by Mr. Vanamee,  who made one of those impressive, pathetic,  eloquent and verdict-getting addresses for  which he has become so famous on the Hudson  River.'' In 1902 Mr. Vanamee was appointed  the general counsel of the state excise depart-  ment at Albany, a position which he held until  he was compelled to resign on account of the  demands of his general practice. He has never  been a candidate for public office except upon  one occasion when in 1888 he was the candi-  date of his party for county judge of Orange  county.   The place occupied by Mr. \'anamee in his  profession has been described in the Neiv-  burg Journal which, upon the conclusion of a     series of articles upon the Bench and Bar con-  tributed to it by Mr. Vanamee, said of him :   'Mr. Vanamee, in discussing so generously the  leaders of the bar of Orange County, forgot to men-  tion one who has long been in the forefront of the  profession — ^himself. In justice to him, then, it falls  on a layman to add him to that constellation of  legal luminaries of which he wrote so well. From  1868, Mr. Vanamee's voice has been heard in the  courts in this and other states in important litiga-  tions. Aside from his admitted knowledge of the  law, Mr. Vanamee has the advantage of unusual  gifts as an orator and public speaker. A natural  fluency of speech he developed by close and constant  study of language, of the best literature, of the  masterpieces of the masters of all ages. Hence it  is that when Mr. Vanamee approaches a subject, be  it a legal argument, a lecture on Burns, a political  address or an after dinner speech, he puts into it  the thought and the finish of the scholar. It is this  habit of the student that has given Mr. Vanamee  that elegance of diction, that grace of rhetoric and  that command of ornate and correct English which  lovers of English pure and undefiled so much admire  in his public addresses and in his writings.   'Mr. Vanamee's articles have been widely read  and extensively reprinted in the press of the county.  They have formed a valuable series of intimate and  personal sketches which have been a delight to  read, and which have added to the reputation of Mr.  Vanamee as a graceful writer and accurate observer  of men.   'When about fifteen years ago Mr. Vanamee re-  moved from Middletown to Newburg, he at once  took a position at the head of the Bar and when  it is know'n that Mr. Vanamee is to sum up a case  for the jury, the Court room is invariably filled with  attorneys, who in this manner pay a tribute to his  eloquence that is sincere and voluntary. In a case  some years ago, in which the reputation of a Mid-  dletown lawyer was at stake, Mr. Vanamee was  brought into the case to present it to the jury and  his address on that occasion is still referred to as  one of the most masterly addresses ever made at  the Newburg Court House. With an eloquent and  keen analysis of the testimony he laid bare the weak  points of the opposition and secured a verdict of  acquittal for his client.'   Mr. Vanamee is frequently called upon for  lectures and addresses. He was the orator of  the day upon the occasion of the Fiftieth An-  niversary of the mustering in of the One Hun-  dred and Twenty-fourth Regiment — the fa-  mous 'Orange Blossoms', held at Goshen on  the fifth of September, 1912, the Middletown  Argus saying of it : 'It was a gem and sur-  passed all of Mr. Vanamee's previous oratori-  cal efforts.' In referring to the address of  Mr. Vanamee delivered on the first of De-  cember, 1912', at the Memorial Service of the  Middletown Lodge of Elks the Middletoivn  Times-Press said : 'It was a masterpiece, not     '34   only ill its delivery, but in construction and  composition.'   Mr. \anamee married (first) in 1871, his  cliildrcn being Dr. Talcott O. Vanamee, now  practicing in Newburg : Rev. Parker Vanamee,  rector o{ the Episcopal church at Burnt Hills,  Saratoga county, and Theodora, wife of Percy  V. D. Gott. Esq., a prominent lawyer of  Goshen. Mr. X'anamee's second marriage oc-  curred in 1009.     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Baylies appears to he allied  B.WLH'^S to the surname Bailey or  Baily, which is usually re-  garded as being Norman in origin. In Bar-  ber's 'British Family Names' the name  Baylies is said to be derived from tlie Flem-  ish Bellis, a personal name.   (I) Thomas Baylies, the first American  ancestor of the family, was the son of Nich-  olas Baylies, of Worcester, England. He  was born, it is thought, in Worcester, Eng-  land, 1687, died at Uxbridge, Massachusetts,  March 5, 1756. He arrived in Boston, Mas-  sachusetts, in June, 1737, accompanied by  his son Nicholas and daughter Esther, but  soon returned to England for his wife and  two other daughters, returning to this coun-  try in 1738. He did considerable work as a  pioneer, for in those days the colonists were  versatile men, able to turn their hands to  almost any trade, and there were few of  them who did not assist in cultivating the  land as well as engage in commercial and  industrial pursuits. He finally settled at  Uxbridge, where he owned land and en-  gaged in farming and other occupations.  His training seems to have been largely  commercial and manufacturing, and he es-  tablished iron works, at Uxbridge, which  developed to a considerable size. He mar-  ried, June 5, 1706, Esther. dauglUcr of  Thomas Sargent, of Fullfonl 1 loath, War-  wickshire, England.   (H) Nicholas, son of Thomas and Esther  (Sargent) Baylies, was born in England  May 10. 1710. diefl at Taunton. Massachu-  setts, July 26. 1807. He resided for a num-  ber of years in Uxt)ridgc, Massachusetts,  from whence he removed to Taunton about  (he year 1757, and became interested in iron  works there. He was a noted patriot at the  time of the revolutionary war, during which  he took part in several stirring incidents.     He married, in 1738, Elizabeth Parks, and  had a son Hodijah, of whom further.   (HI) Judge Hodijah Baylies, son of  Nicholas and Elizabeth (Parks) Baylies,  was born at Taunton, Massachusetts, Sep-  tember 17, 1756, died at Dighton April 26,  1843. He was graduated from Harvard Col-  lege with the degree of Bachelor of Arts in  1777, and in the same year enlisted in a  company. Then he was appointed aide-de-  camp to General Benjamin Lincoln, one of  the most famous soldiers of the revolution-  ary war, and served with him at the siege  of Charleston and the capture of Yorktown.  He was ajjpointed aide-de-camp to General  George Washington, May 3, 1782. He set-  tled at Dighton about the year 1785. He  occupied various civil positions of ])rnmi-  nence, including that of collector of the port  of Dighton, to which he was appointed Au-  gust 4, 1789, and from February 20, 1810,  to December 20, 1834, was judge of prol)ate  in Bristol county. He was a member of  the Society of the Cincinnati and of sexeral  other patriotic societies.   Judge Baylies married, in 1784, Elizabeth,  daughter of General Benjamin Lincoln, of  Hingham, who was delegated to receive the  sW'Ord of Cornwallis at the battle of York-  town. General Lincoln's family were  among the earliest settlers of New England.  From one branch President Abraham Lincoln  descended, while another produced Levi  Lincoln, a leading revolutionary patriot and  prominent lawyer of Massachusetts in the  years following the war. His equally fa-  mous son, General Levi Lincoln, born in 1782,  died in 1868, was foremost among statesmen  of the earlier j)eriod of the nineteenth cen-  tury. General Benjamin Lincoln, born at  Hingham, Massachusetts, 1733, was a mem-  ber of the colonial assembly, and as colonel  of the militia was active in organizing troops  at the outbreak of the revolution and at the  siege of Boston. He became major-general  in 1776 and served throughout the war. He  was wounded at Bemis Heights in the Sara-  toga c;inii)aign, while acting as second in  command under General Gates. He was in  command of the southern department, and  became secretary of war under the confed-  eration from 1781 to 1784. He suppressed  the famous Shay's rebellion in Massachu-  setts. He was lieutenant-governor of the     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     135     state in 1787, and held many offices of promi-  nence, including that of commissioner to  various Indian tribes. Among the children  of Hodijah Baylies was Edmund, of whom  further.   (IV) Edmund, son of Judge Hodijah and  Elizabeth (Lincoln) Baylies, was born at  Hingham, Massachusetts, September 22,  1787. died at Taunton, Massachusetts, May  10, 1878. He was a merchant at Boston for  a number of years, achieving success along  that line. In 1838 he removed to Taunton  and established a country home, which is  still occupied by members of the Baylies  family. He was a member of the Massa-  chusetts Society of the Cincinnati. He mar-  ried, in 1819, Elizabeth, daughter of Philip  and Ruth Payson, of Charlestown, Massachu-  setts, and had a son Edmund Lincoln, of  whom further.   (V) Edmund Lincoln, son of Edmund  and Elizabeth (Payson) Baylies, was born  at Boston, Massachusetts, May 18, 1829,  died at Geneva, Switzerland, November 28,  1869. He was graduated from Harvard  University with the degree of Bachelor of  Arts in 1850. He lived during his early life  in Boston and Taunton, Massachusetts, and  after his marriage made his home in New  York City. He married, November 27,  1856, Nathalie, daughter of Robert Ray, of  the New York family of that name, which  has given a number of distinguished men in  public and commercial life to the city and  state.   (VI) Edmund Lincoln (2), son of Ed-  mund Lincoln (i) and Nathalie (Ray) Bay-  lies, was born in New York City December  2, 1857. He was graduated from Philip's  Exeter Academy in 1875, and from Harvard  University in 1879 with the degree of Bach-  elor of Arts, and in 1882 with the degree of  Bachelor of Laws. This was supplemented  by a course at the Columbia Law School,  from which he also received the degree of  Bachelor of Laws. He was admitted to the  bar in 1882, and on his return from a trip  around the world he began the practice of  law. He is now a memloer of the law firm  of Carter, Ledyard & Milburn. In 1902 he  was appointed secretary to the special embassv  of the LTnited States to the coronation of King  Edward VII. of England. He is vice-presi-  dent of the Mexican Telegraph Company,     trustee of the New York Life Insurance  and Trust Company, and of Greenwood  Cemetery. He is a member of the Associa-  tion of the Bar of the City of New York,  the Society of the Cincinnati, the Century,  Knickerbocker, University, Down Town,  City and New York Yacht clubs.   Mr. Baylies married, January 18, 1887,  Louisa, daughter of the late Alexander \'an  Rensselaer, and granddaughter of Stephen  A'an Rensselaer, of Albany, New York, pa-  troon, thus becoming connected with one  of the very foremost old families of New  York, if not of the country.     The family of this name is not  SHOVE very numerously represented  in New England, but has fur-  nished many e.xcellent citizens, and has or-  namented the work of the clergy in several  localities, especially in Taunton and Dan-  bury, Connecticut. The earliest records  show that there was a widow. Margery  Shove, at Rowley, Massachusetts, in 1643.  She was possibly the mother of Rev. George  Shove, whose birthplace has not been lo-  cated after much research by genealogists.  (I) Rev. George Shove was the third min-  ister at Taunton, Massachusetts, where he  was ordained pastor, November 17, 1665,  and died April 21, 1687. It is probable that  the minister was not substantially support-  ed as we find that he was an extensive dealer  in real estate which was due perhaps to the  necessity of his finding other means of sup-  port than that afforded him as a minister.  He was one of the original proprietors of  the Taunton North Purchase which includ-  ed what is now the towns of Norton, Easton  and Mansfield. He married (first) July 12,  1664, Hopestill, daughter of Rev. Samuel  Newman of Rehoboth. Massachusetts. She  died March 7, 1673, and he married (sec-  ond) February 18, 1675, Hannah, daughter  of Rev. Thomas Waller. She died Decem-  ber 22, i68q, and he married (third) De-  cember 8, i(S86, Sarah, daughter of Thomas  Farwcll. Children of the first marriage:  Edward, died young; Elizabeth, born Au-  gust 10, 1666; Seth, mentioned below; Na-  thaniel. January 29, 1669; Samuel, June 16,  1670; Sarah, July 30, 1671. Of second mar-  riage: Mary, born August ti, 1676; Jo-  hanna, September 28, 1678; Edward, Octo-     536     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     ber 3, 1680; Yetmercy, Noven-oer 7, 1682.  The last is usually spoken of in the records  as Mercy Shove.   (IIj Rev. Seth Shove, second son of Rev.  George and Hopestill (Newman) Shove,  was born September 10, 1667. He gradu-  ated at Harvard College in 1687, and taught  school in Newbury, Massachusetts, and at  Danbury, Connecticut. He was ordained  clergyman at the latter place October 13,  1697, was the first minister of the church  in Danbury and spent the remainder of his  life engaged in the ministry there ; he died  October 3, 1735. His house was occupied  as a garrison during the Indian troubles in  early days. When the British burned Dan-  bury in 1777, all its records were destroyed,  and consequently no record of his marriage  or children appears, but tradition states that  for several generations the line of descent  was continued through sons named Seth.   (V) Herman K. Shove, a descendant of  Rev. Seth Siiove, was born 1794 and died  1866. He married Olive Blakely and had  issue. Levi Shove, a brother of Herman  K. Shove was born in Danbury, married  Abigail Weed of that town and was among  the early settlers of Warren, Connecticut,  where he lived and died.   (VI) Henry Shove, born about 1830, son  of Herman K. and Olive (Blakely) Shove,  resided in Warren, where he was a farmer,  an active member of the Methodist church,  and a \\hig in politics. He married Fanny  Lane and their children were: John W.,  Frank D., Edward II., Garwood, Jennie and  Levi A. The daughter became the wife of  Harlcy Beeman.   (V'll) Levi A., youngest son of Henry  and Fanny (Lane) Shove, was born May  4. 1855, in Warren, and died at Brewster,  New York. November 22, 1906. In 1875  he settled in Brewster where for many years  he conducted a successful livery business.  He was an ardent Republican in political  principle, and served as a trustee of the vil-  lage of Brewster, being also a member of  the fire company of that place. He married,  October 18. 1876. Flora Eliza, born October  8, 1856, in Kent, Connecticut, daughter of  Ralj.h and Harriet M. (Benedict) Howland,  of that town. Ralph Howland was born  May 31, 1S17, in Kent, and died there, Jan-  uary 2. i8r.o. Ilarri, t \I I'..nedict was born     December 2},, 1816, and died April 20, 1897.  They were among the active and useful  members of the Methodist church. Their  children were: Justina Maria, born October  13, 1843, married Lehman T. Peet ; Sherman  William, August 11, 1844; Mark Benedict,  October 29, 1846; Mary Frances, December  18, 1853, became the wife of Charles T.  Chase; Flora Eliza, of previous mention;  Eveline Amanda, October 11, 1857, died  September 10, 1875. The only child of Levi  A. Shove is Florence Howland Shove, born  January 8, 1880, in Brewster; she was edu-  cated in the Brewster public schools and  Lyndon Hall, Poughkeepsie. She is one of  the active members of the Brewster Metho-  dist Church, and is connected with the Ce-  cilian Society, and the Women's Christian  Temperance Union.     The surname Van Du-  VAN DUZER zer is Dutch in origin,   and in its original form  is said to be derived from a word or appel-  lation meaning 'a place of many waters'.  Its probable derivation is from the name of  a hamlet of about five hundred inhabitants  in Noord Braband, in the Netherlands,  called Deursen. This was according to one  method adopted by the Dutch emigrants  who came to these shores in the establish-  ment of surnames, such a name indicating  that the emigrant to whom the name w'as  later applied, was originally from ('van')  Deursen in the Netherlands. This method,  as well as that of deriving the family name  from the name of the father or grandfather  with some prefix or suffix indicating de-  scent attached, prevailed in New Amster-  dam or New York during the Dutch occu-  pation and for some time after. This par-  ticular name, \'an Deursen or \'an Duzer,  was in early days spelled in a variety of  ways that have continued to this day. This  was nearly the case with every type of sur-  name, Dutch as well as English, German  and the like in origin, in the early days of  colonial settlement. The name was written  down phonetically, that is it was written  down as it struck the hearer's ear and as  the writer at the moment chose to render  its orthography, and this confusion of sound  and orthography resulted in an absolute ab-  sence of rule, the same writer or copyist     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     137     often rendering the same name with differ-  ent orthography, a number of times in the  same document. The result of this may be  seen in the name here dealt with, perhaps  as well as in any other. Thus it has been  rendered and is found to-day as Van Deusen,  Yandeusen, Van Duzen, Van Dense, Van  Deussen, Van Dorsen, Van Dozer, Van  Duce, Van Duesen, Van Dueser, Van Due-  son, Vanduens, Van Dusan, Vanduse, Van  Duersen, \'an Deuzer, Van Duzer, Van Deur-  sen and Van Deurse.   (I) Abraham Pietersen Van Deursen, the  immigrant ancestor in America of the Van  Duzer family here dealt with, was born at  Haarlem, Holland, baptized there November  II, 1607, and died in New Amsterdam or  New York in some year following 1644,  when his youngest child was born. He  married in 1629 and a few years later came  to America. He is recorded as being in New  Amsterdam in 1636 and lived in the Heere-  wegh Straat or Broadway, carrying on the  occupation of miller and innkeeper, trading  also in land and cattle. He married, in  Haarlem, Holland, December 7, 1629,  Tryntje Melchiors. Children: Teunis, born  in 1631 at Haarlem, Holland; Marytje, born  in 1632 at Haarlem, Holland; Isaac, men-  tioned below ; Jacob, born in 1638 in New  Amsterdam; Pieter, born in 1642 in New  Amsterdam ; Melchior, born in 1644 in New  Amsterdam.   (H) Isaac, second son of Abraham Pieter-  sen and Tryntje (Melchiors) Van Deursen,  consequently bearing the sobriquet after the  Dutch fashion of Abrahamszen, was born in  New Amsterdam in the year 1637, died in  New Amsterdam some time after 1677. He  was a resident of New Amsterdam the  greater part of his life. He married, April 5,  1659, Jannetje Jans. Children: Abraham,  born in New Amsterdam in 1659; Jacobus,  born in New Amsterdam in 1662; Geer-  truyd, born in New Amsterdam in 1665,  died young; Geertruyd (2), born in 1666;  Isaac, mentioned below; Sarah, born in  1677.   (HI) Isaac (2), youngest son of Isaac (i)  and Jannetje (Jans) Van Deursen, and con-  sequently bearing the Dutch sobriquet of  Isaacsz, was baptized May i. 1670, died in  New York some time after 1727, the year in  which his youngest child was born. He     was made a freeman, August 30, 1698. He  married, April 24, 1697, Metje Christaens.  Children : Isaac, mentioned below ; Chris-  tian, baptized in 1700; Catryna, born in  1702; Jenneke, born in 1705; Lea, born in  1715; Shadrach, born in 1727.   (IV) Isaac (3), eldest son of Isaac (2)  and Metje (Christaens) Van Deursen, and  consequently bearing the sobriquet of  Isaacsz, was born in New York, baptized  in New York, February 6, 1698, died in  Cornwall, Orange county, New York, March  30, 1792. On the military roll of Orange  county. New York, in 1715 his name appears  as Ysack Van Dures, and in his will, dated  June 14, 1783, as Van Duzer, which spelling  has since been followed by his descendants.  He resided at Tappan, New York, in 1718.  From there he appears to have gone to  Ramapo, where he lived from the year 1724  to the year 1748. Later he settled in Corn-  wall, Orange county. New York. At Corn-  wall he figured as a large landowner, pos-  sessing one thousand acres. He married  (first) in 1718, Argenetie Laroe. (second) in  1723, Elizabeth Rosenboom, of New York.  Children by first marriage : Wiberech, bap-  tized in 1720; Isack, baptized in 1721, both  this child and the first being baptized at  Hackensack, New Jersey. Children by sec-  ond marriage: Augneitje, born in 1724;  Tjerck, born in 1726: Martha, born in 1728;  Marrytje, born in 1730; Elizabeth, born in  1732; Catherine, born in 1734; Leah, born  in 1736; Antie, born in 1738; Jannetje, born  in 1741 ; Christopher, mentioned below; Ma-  ria, born in 1749.   (V) Christopher Van Duzer, youngest son  of Isaac (3) and Elizabeth (Rosenboom) Van  Deursen, was born in 1743. He passed his  youth and a great part of his adult life at  Cornwall, Orange county, New York.

The original ancestors  GANSEVOORT of the Gansevoort fami-  lies of the Hudson and  Mohawk Valleys in New York state lived  in a town called Ganzfort, which was situ-  ated on the borders of Germany and Hol-  land. Wesselius Gansefortius. otherwise  known in his own day as Wessel Ganse-  voort and also as John Wessel Gansevoort,  was born at Groningcn. Holland, in the year  1419, in a house standing in the Heerestraat,  near the Caroliweg, and which can be rec-  ognized by the family arms which re-  main to this day in the front stone. The  arms themselves appear to present an em-  blem of agriculture and commerce, from  which it may be assumed that the Ganse-  voorts of early times were engaged in those  avocations. And besides the family name  of Gansevoort (doubtless derived from the  village of Ganzfort, in Westfalen), he bore     i      1      l/yy^My;     //ZA^yAJ/yiy^ ^^^     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     139     in later times among men of eminent learn-  ing the name of Basilius, and the title of  Lux Mundi {light of the world), and also  the name of Magistcr Contradictionis (Mas-  ter of Contradictions or Debates). For this  • latter title he is probably indebted to his  continued attacks against tlie errors and  abuses of the church. He also has been re-  ferred to and mentioned as the forerunner  of Luther, and he favored the school of  absolute nominalism in philosophy. He was  a leader in the pre-Reformation movement  in Hollaiul, and ranked among the most  learned men of his time; was an intimate  friend in early life of Thomas a Kempis,  studied at several of the great schools of  Europe, and was offered and declined a pro-  fessorshij) at Heidelberg. At Paris he was  the instructor of two men who afterward  achieved wide fame, Reuchlin and Agricola,  and subsequently he visited in Rome when  Sixtus IV. was Pope. He had been on  terms of intimacy with Sixtus when the lat-  ter was superior-general of the Franciscans.  It is related that he was asked by Sixtus  what favor he could do for him, and in an-  swer Wessel asked for a Greek and Hebrew  Bible from the Vatican library. 'You shall  have it,'' said the Pope, 'but what a sim-  pleton you are ; why did you not ask for a  bishopric or something of that kind?' 'Be-  cause I do not want it,' replied Wessel, a  reply truly characteristic of his high tone  and independent spirit. On religious sub-  jects his views were broad and deep, and he  promulgated with boldness the doctrines of  the Reformation forty years in advance of  Luther, who held his character and attain-  ments in high esteem and who published an  edition of part of his works. His name, still  retained by the family in this country, is  reverenced in Groningen, his native city,  where in 1862 an ancient tablet to his mem-  ory was restored by the authorities of the  city and placed in the large church with  demonstrations of public regard.   The Hon. Harmanus Bleecker, when min-  ister to The Hague, stated that there was  no doubt of the descent of the family from  this philosopher, and papers in possession  of the family of the late Judge Peter Ganse-  voort, of AUiany, show the fact more clear-  ly. In i860 his tomb at Groningen was vis-  ited by Judge Gansevoort and his son, and     a few days previous to their arrival the re-  mains had been disinterred and were lying  in the cloister of the Holy Virgins, to which  place they had been removed from the  chapel of the University to make room for  modern improvements. His tomli also had  been removed and was lying in pieces ready  to be reerected. It was of the medieval  style and surmounted by a bust of Wessel,  such as was usually placed over tombs of  that description. The bust was of marble,  but, like that of Shakespeare at Stratford,  it had been painted in different colors. It  showed him to be a man of intellect and  benevolence, and the inscription on the tomb  was elaborate and magniloquent. The  bones of the body were in perfect preserva-  tion and were regarded by those in charge  with great reverence, and they were rein-  terred with ceremony. It is a somewhat  singular fact that at the time of the arrival  there of Judge Gansevoort and his son, the  house of their ancestor Wessel Gansevoort  was being demolished to make room for a  more modern building. It contained above  the front door a marble slab on which was  carved the same coat-of-arms as that borne  by the family in America, viz. : 4 quarters,  a ship and wagon.   Wesselius Gansefortius died October 9,  1489. It is said that during his last sickness  he complained that through various consid-  erations and reflections he felt his belief in  the great truths of the Christian religion  shaken, but not long before his death he  was heard to exclaim with great thankful-  ness, 'I thank God, all these vain thoughts  have gone, and I know nothing but Christ  and Him crucified.' Such then are some-  thing of the qualities and characteristics of  the great scholar and philosopher, who,  without doubt, is the remote ancestor of the  family of the Gansevoort surname purposed  to be treated in these annals. It is not  known in what year the first Gansevoort  emigrated to the Low Country of Holland,  but it is known that the first of the surname  on this side of the Atlantic Ocean appeared  in New Netherlands in the year 1660.   fl) Harme Van Ganzvort (he so wrote  his name in all of his business and family  transactions so long as he lived) came to  America and settled at Catskill, on the Hud-  son river, in 1660. There he had an ex-     140     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     ttnsive manor, doubtless acquired from the  Indians, but afterward his lands were grant-  ed to others. It is related by one chronicler  of the family history that Harme lived for  some time at Catskill, on an estate more re-  cently owned by the Van Vechten family,  and that he was unjustly deprived of his  property by one of the Dutch governors who  went by water from New Amsterdam to  Albany and on his passage up the river an-  chored his vessel opposite Catskill creek.  There the governor went ashore with his  secretary or aide, walked up to the Ganz-  vort dwelling, and was hospitably enter-  tained by the proprietor. The secretary ex-  pressed his admiration of the estate, solic-  ited a grant of it from the governor, and  secured it. In consequence of this, Harme  \'an Ganzvort, who had no other title to the  land than that of possession and the consent  of the Indian owners, was compelled to  leave and locate elsewhere. From Catskill  he removed with his family to Albany,  v.here, having been brought up to the trade  of a brewer, he set up in that business and  continued it so long as he lived. His home  and brew house were at the corner of Mar-  ket street and Maiden lane. This property  has been kept in the family and on the site  now stands Stanwix Hall.   Harme Van Gansevoort (or Van Ganz-  vort) died July 23, 1710. He was a man of  character and ability, a member of the Lu-  theran church. Of his means he gave to  the society of that church a lot of land on  which to erect a house of worship, and be-  neath the puli)it in the church his remains  were buried. The lot is on South Pearl  street, where the market house was built in  later years. His wife was Marritje Lien-  darts, who died in 1742. Children: i. El-  sie, married, 1689, Francis Winne. 2. Maria.   3. Auguitie, married, i(So8. Tennis Williams.   4. Anna, married, 1692, Jacobus De \\'arrien.   5. Lysbeth, married, 1701. Johannes De Wan-  dclaer. 6.

(II) Leonard Gansevoort (Liendart Van  Ganzvort), son of Harme and Marritje  (Liendarts) Van Ganzvort, was born in Al-     b'any, in 1681, and died there November 30,  1763. He succeeded his father in the own-  ership of the brewery and its business, and  continued it as his principal occupation. He  is remembered as a man of small stature, of  placid and serene countenance, and of up-  light character. He married, in 1712. Cath-  erine De Wandelaer, who survived him,  and it was in a large measure through her  strong character and superior business abil-  ities that her husband was enabled to ac-  cumulate a comfortable fort .ne. One of  her descendants writing of her said that  'her activity of mind made her quite a busi-  ness woman and rendered her a great bless-  ing to her husband, who was a quiet, mod-  erate man.' Children: Harme, born 1712,  (see post) ; Henry, born 1716, died 1746;  John, died young; Sarah, born 1718, died  1731 ; Johannes, born 1719, died 1781, mar-  ried (first) 1750. Marritje Douw (born 1725,  died 1750), married (second) Elsie Beek-  man, daughter of Jacob; Maria, born 1723,  died 1739; Peter, born 1725, died 1809, mar-  ried, 1751, Garritje Ten Eycke; Elsie, born  1728, died 1753; Aguitie, born 1730, died  1731 ; Elsie, died 1761.   (Ill) Harme, son of Leonard and Cather-  ine (De Wandelaer) Gansevoort, was born  in Albany, and baptized there April 20,  1712, and died there May 7, 1801. He was a  merchant in Albany and carried on an ex-  tensive business, importing his goods from  Europe. He inherited from his father the  brewery property and continued it in con-  I'.ection with his other business interests.  He also appears to have been somewhat en-  gaged in public affairs, and it is evident that  he was a man of excellent understanding  and business capacity. From September 25,  1750, to 1760, he was clerk of the county  court and of the court of common pleas,  clerk of the peace and of the sessions. In  1763 he purchased and caused to be brought  over from England what probably was the  second hand fire engine ever used in Al-  bany, paying therefor the sum of $397.50.  He married. May 29, 1740. Magdalena  Douw, born August i, 1718, died October  12, 1796, daughter of Petrus and Anna (\'an  Rensselaer) Douw. Petrus (sometimes  written Pieter) Douw, was born March 24,  1692. died August 21, 1775. son of Jonas  Volkertse Douw of Manor Rensselaerwvck,     I     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     141     who married (first) November 14, 1683,  Magdalena Pieterse Quackenboss, and mar-  ried (second) April 24, 1696, Catrina Van  Witbeck, widow of Jacob Sanderse Glen.  Jonas Volkertse Douw was the eldest son  from Frederickstadt and was in Beverwyck  as early as 1638. He died in 1686. He had  his house on the west corner of State street  of Captain Volkert Janse Douw, who came  and Broadway, which property is now  owned by his descendants. He was a trader  and brewer, and in connection with Jan  Thomase he dealt quite largely in real es-  tate. Their brewery was located on the east  half of the Exchange block lot and extended  to the river. This they sold in 1675 to Hai'-  men Rutgers, son of Rutger Jacobsen. In  1663 they bought of the Indians, Schotack  or Apjen's (Little Monkey's) island and the  main land lying east of it. Captain Douw  also owned Constapel's island, lying oppo-  site Bethlehem, half of which he sold in  1677 to Pieter \Vinne. In 1672 he owned  Schutter's island, below Beeren island,  which he sold to Barent Pieterse Coeymans.  He married, April 19, 1650, Dorotee Janse,  from Breestede, Holland. She was a sister  of Rutger Jacobsen's wife, and died Novem-  ber 2, 1681. He died in 1686. Anna Van  Rensselaer, wife of Petrus Douw, was born  January 4, 1719, daughter of Killian and  Maria (Van Cortlandt) Van Rensselaer,  granddaughter of Jeremias and Maria (Van  Cortlandt) \^an Rensselaer, and great-  granddaughter of Killian Van Rensselaer,  merchant of Amsterdam, Holland, who mar-  ried (first) Hillegonda Van Bylet and (sec-  ond) Anna Wely. Killian Van Rensselaer,  son of Jeremias, was the first lord of the  Manor of Rensselaerwyck. Children of  Karme and Magdalena (Douw) Gansevoort:  I. Sarah, born 1741, married John Ten  Broeck. 2. Peter, born 1742, died 1743. 3.  Anna, born 1744, died 1794; married, 1778,  Cornelius Wyncoop. 4. Catherine, born  1747, died 1749. 5. Peter, born 1749 (see  post). 6. Leonard, born 1751, died 1810,  married, 1770, Hester Cuyler, born 1749,  died 1826. 7. Henry, born 1753, died 1755.  8. Hendrick, born 1757. 9. Catrina, died  1 761.   (IV) General Peter Gansevoort Jr., son  of Harme and Magdalena (Douw) Ganse-  voort, was born in Albany, in 1749, where     Stanwix Hall now stands, and died in his  native city, July 2, 181 2, at the age of sixty-  three years. On July 2, 1775, he was ap-  pointed by congress a major in the Second  New York Regiment. In August of that  year he joined the army which invaded Can-  ada under Montgomery. In March, 1776,  he was made lieutenant-colonel, and on No-  vember 21 following became colonel of the  regiment. In July, 1776, he was colonel com-  manding at Fort George, on Lake George.  In April, 1777, he took command of Fort  Stanwix (afterward called Fort Schuyler),  on the present site of the city of Rome, and  made a gallant defence of the post against  the British under St. Leger, which was the  first blow to their great scheme to sever  New York from the residue of the confed-  eracy, and by thus preventing the coopera-  tion of that ofiicer with Burgoyne, contrib-  uted most essentially to the great and de-  cisive victory at Saratoga. For this gallant  defence the thanks of congress were voted  to Colonel Gansevoort. In the spring of  1779 Colonel Gansevoort was ordered to join  General Sullivan in an expedition against  the Indians in the western part of New  York. At the head of a chosen party from  the army he distinguished himself by sur-  prising, by the celerity of his movements,  the lower Mohawk castle, and capturing all  the Indian inhabitants of the vicinity. In  1781 the state of New York appointed him  brigadier-general, and afterwards he filled a  number of important ofifices, among which  was that of commissioner of Indian affairs  and for fortifying the frontiers. He also  was military agent and a brigadier-general  in the United States army in 1809, sheriff of  Albany county from 1790 to 1792, a regent  of the University of the State of New York  from 1808 until the time of his death, and  one of the first board of directors of the  New York State Bank in 1803.   The foregoing account is hardly more  than a very brief outline of the career of  one of the bravest and most determined sol-  diers and patriots of the revolution, an ofifi-  cer whose courage never was doubted,  whose achievements as a commanding offi-  cer were fully appreciated, but whose splen-  did service never was more than half re-  warded. And it has remained for one of his  descendants, a granddaughter, to cause to     142     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     be erected an appropriate memorial of his  noble record and unselfish patriotism; and  all honor is due iMrs. Catherine Gansevoort  Lansing for the gift which marks the place  of old Fort Stanwix— 'a fort which never  surrendered,' and tiie fort from which the  first American flag was unfurled in the face  of the enemy. The 'General Peter Ganse-  voort Statue,' in bronze, stands in the circle  in the East Park, Rome, New York, facing  the west. The figure is in full uniform,  heroic in size, seven feet two inches tall,  standing at ease in military position, the  left foot slightly forward. In the right hand  is held the letter of St. Leger demanding  the surrender of the fort, while the left hand  rests on the hilt of the sword. The pedestal  weighs nearly three tons and stands on a  base weighing twenty tons, and the whole  lests on a solid concrete foundation nearly  four feet thick. On the outer edge of the  Hag walk around the monument is a stone  toping of Barre granite, rock finish, the  same material on which the statue rests, the  coping being a foot wide and a foot thick.  On the front tablet of the monument ap-  pears this inscription ;   Brigaelicr-Gcncral Peter Gansevoort, Jr., Colonel  in the Continental .Army. He served under Mont-  gomcrj- in Canada in the campaign against Quebec  in 1775, and in 1777 he successfully defended Fort  Stanwi.x against the British forces and their Indian  allies under St. Leger, thus preventing their junc-  tion with Burgoyne at Saratoga. 1 le took part in  the campaign of 1770 under General Sullivan. He  was in active command at the outbreak of the War  of 1812, and died on the second day of July of that  year at the age of 63.   On the rear tablet tiiis inscription ap-  pears :   Erected near the site of   FORT ST.\NWIX   at the request of Peter Gansevoort,   Henry S. Gansevoort, U. S. A.,   and .'Xbraham Lansing, all of   Albany, N. Y.   Presented to the City of Rome by   Catherine Gansevoort   Lansing.   A. D. 1906.   General Gansevoort married, January 12,  1778, Catherine (Catrina) Van Schaick, bap-  tized August 16, 1752, died December 30,  1830, daughter of Wessel Van Schaick, who  was ha|)tizcd February 10, 1712, and mar-  ried, November 3, 1743, Maria Gerritse, who  died January 31, 1797. Wessel Van Schaick     was son of Anthony (or Antony) Van  Schaick, Sybrant, filius, glazier, born 1681,  married, (J)ctober 19, 1707, Anna Catherine  Ten Broeck, who died in December, 1756.  In 1704 Anthony Van Schaick's house lot  was at the south corner of State and Pearl  streets, Albany. He was a son of Sybrant  Van Schaick, born 1653, who married Eliza-  beth Van Der Poel, and died about 1785.  In 1678 his step-mother agreed to sell him  her half of the brewery on the easterly half  of the Exchange block for one hundred  beavers. He was a son of Captain Goosen  Gerritse Van Schaick, brewer of Albany.  In 1664 he and Philip Pieterse Schuyler  were granted permission to purchase Halve  Maan of the Indians, to prevent 'those of  Connecticut' from purchasing it. In 1664  also he bought of his stepfather, Ryner El-  bertse, a lot on the north corner of Colum-  bia street and Broadway, and in 1675 he and  Pieter Lassingh bought Harmne (or  Harme) Rutgers brewery on the Exchange  block. 'In 1657, being about to marry his  second wife, he made a contract in which  he reserved from his estate 6,000 guilders  for his four eldest children by the first wife,  that being her separate estate; and in 1668  he and his second wife made a joint will, he  being about to depart for Holland.' Cap-  tain Van Schaick married (first) in 1649,  Cieertie Brantse Van Nieuwkerk, who died  about 1656; married (second), 1657, An-  natie Lievens, or Lievense.   General Gansevoort's children: i. Her-  man, born 1779, died 1862; married, in 1813,  Catherine Quackenboss, born 1774, died  1855. 2. Wessel, born 1781, died 1862. 3.  Leonard, born 1783, died 1821 ; married,  1809, Mary A. Chandonette, born 1789, died  1851. 4. Peter, born 1786, died 1788. 5.  Peter, born December 22, 1788, (see post).  (. Maria, born 1791. married, 1814, Allan  Melville, born 1782, died 1832.   (V) Judge Peter Ciansevoort, son of Gen-  eral Peter and Catherine (Van Schaick)  Gansevoort, was born in Albany, December  22, 1788, and died at his home in that city,  January 4, 1876. His higher literary edu-  cation was acquired at the College of New  Jersey. Princeton, where he graduated, and  afterward he attended the celebrated Litch-  field Law School ; still later read law in the  office of Harmanus Bleecker, and was ad-     i      <^^Z-^z:^-g^'2.<^      SOUTHERN NEW YORK     143     mitted to the bar about 181 1. His practice  for many years was very considerable, and  he ranked among the prominent members  of the profession. For some time he acted  as private secretary to Governor DeWitt  Clinton, and then on his military staff as  judge advocate general from 1819 to 1821.  In 1830-31 he was a member of the assem-  bly, and then a senator for four years, 1833  to 183C inclusive. In all matters of public  interest he took an active part, and was  thoroughly attached to all that concerned  his native city. He was a trustee of the  Albany Academy for fifty years, and for  twenty years was chairman of the board.  In 1840 he was one of a committee, with  Stephen Van Rensselaer, John A. Dix and  others, to organize the Albany Cemetery  Association, and to select grounds for the  cemetery. He was a trustee of the ceine-  tery until his death, and took a warm in-  terest in arranging and beautifying the  grounds. For many years he was a direc-  tor of the New York State Bank, and occu-  pied other positions of trust. Although his  military service was short, he took a warm  interest throughout life in military matters.   Among the public positions held by Gen-  eral Gansevoort was that of first judge of  the county court of Albany county from  1843 *^o 1847, the duties of which office he  discharged with great fidelity and to the  entire satisfaction of the legal profession  and the public. He carried marked traits  of his ancestry with him through life, and  was a most thorough representative of the  Dutch element of his native city. He was  the very embodiment of high-souled honor  and integrity, pure in private life, and de-  votedly attached to his country and its in-  stitutions. On more than one occasion he  visited the countries of the Old World in  search of health and instruction, but always  returned home with his love for his own  government strengthened by comparison  with those abroad. He was a man of court-  ly manners and commanding presence, and  ill society was very genial and engaging.  His kind heart and generous impulses made  him a favorite with all classes of men, and  he lived without enemies, and no one is left  of all who knew him who does not mourn  his death and honor his memory. The ill-  ness of Judge Gansevoort was long and try-     ing; but he retained his mental powers to  the last and sank quietly and peacefully to  his rest, just as his country had entered on  the centennial year of its independence, in  achieving which his father had rendered  such important service. His funeral took  place on Saturday, January 8, 1876, and was  largely attended by public officers as well  as by fainily friends and citizens. The offi-  cers of the Albany Burgesses Corps, with  the patriotic spirit which always marked  that organization, attended in military un-  dress as a guard of honor ; and the cadets  of the Albany Academy, to the number of  nearly one hundred, were also present in  their drill uniform. Religious services were  performed at the house by the Rev. Dr.  Clark of the North Dutch (Reformed)  Church, of which church Judge Gansevoort  was a member in communion ; and his re-  mains were conveyed to that cemetery for  which he had done so much.   In 1833 Judge Gansevoort married (first)  Mary Sanford, born 1814, died 1841, daugh-  ter of Hon. Nathan Sanford, chancellor of  this state, and subsequently senator in Con-  gress. He married (second) December 12,  1843, Susan Lansing, who died in October,  1874, daughter of Abraham G. Lansing, of  Albany. Children: Henry Sanford (see  post); Mary; Catherine, married Abraham  Lansing, and survives him ; Herman.   (VI) Colonel Henry Sanford Gansevoort,  U. S. A., son of Judge Peter and Mary (San-  ford) Gansevoort, was born in Albany, New  York, December 15, 1835, and died April 12,  1871, on board the steamer 'Drew,' in the  Hudson river, opposite Rhinebeck, on the  passage home from Nassau, New Provi-  dence. His earlier education was received  at the Albany Academy and Phillips An-  dover Academy, where he fitted for college,  then entered the sophomore class at Prince-  ton College, where he soon became a mem-  ber of the same literary society to which his  father harl belonged many vears before, and  was graduated in 1855, with distinguished  honors; his collegiate course having been  highly successful, not alone in mere schol-  arship, but in having secured to him a fixed  position among his associates as the pos-  sessor of leading and brilliant qualities of  mind. This general success as a student cul-  minated well at the close of his college life.     144   when his display of oratorical ability at  commencement was regarded as showing  the possession of powers of a high order.  Leaving college he entered Harvard Law  School, and afterward became a student in  the law office of Spragiie & Fillmore, Buf-  falo, New York, and still later with Bow-  doin, Barlow & Larocque, New York City;  and while with the latter firm he accom-  panied his father, mother and sister to Eu-  rope, and remained abroad about fifteen  months. On his return he became law part-  ner with George H. Brewster, in New York,  and as a member of that firm engaged in  active practice at the beginning of the civil  war.   Many incidents of his life thoroughly  prove that while emulous of civil distinction  he nevertheless had a strong inclination for  the military service; and with tastes and  predilections of this character it is not  strange that in the public incidents at this  time occurring his active mind should at  once seek employment in a new and con-  genial career. He had joined the Seventh  Regiment of New York militia, which was  among the first to be sent to Washington  at the outbreak of the war, and at a time  when that city was cut off from all com-  munication with the North. He served as  private with the regiment until its return ;  but what was to some of his comrades the  termination of a dangerous service was to  him but the beginning of an active public  duty to which he became solely devoted,  and to which he finally gave up his life.  He accordingly applied himself to obtaining  a commission in the regular service, for  which purpose he went to Washington, and  after many delays and disappointments he  was rewarded by receiving a commission as  second lieutenant in the Fifth Regiment of  regular artillery, U. S. A. After receiving  his commission and while General McClel-  lan was moulding the material under his  command into the Army of the Potomac,  Colonel Gansevoort was under orders as sec-  ond lieutenant in a camp of instruction at  Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, fitting himself  for the duties of an artillery officer. He  joined McClellan on the Peninsula, and was  with the Potomac army throughout the  I'cninsular campaign after it left Yorktown.  He was in the second battle of Bull Run,     SOL-TllERN NEW YORK     and afterward at Antietam, where his bat-  tery was placed in a position near the fa-  mous cornfield, by Hooker's orders, and sus-  tained heavy loss in men and horses. He  was with his battery throughout the battle,  and for a time was in command.   Obtaining a leave of absence from the  regular army to take a command in the vol-  unteers, Colonel Gansevoort was appointed  by Ciovernor Seymour, lieutenant-colonel of  the Thirteenth Regiment New York Volun-  teer Cavalry, took command of his regiment  soon after his appointment, and was almost  immediately ordered to take it to Washing-  ton. This was about the time when Lee  was advancing to the Potomac and just  previous to the battle of Chancellorsville.  His command, new, undisciplined, and never  before in the field, was put on duty in the  defenses of Washington. It is stated in  Colonel Gansevoort's letters that after he  had obeyed orders to report at Washington  and had reported the strength of his com-  mand, he received an immediate reply that  there were an equal number of horses and  saddles awaiting them, and orders to go for-  ward to the defense of the capital. In these  embarrassing circumstances, with a regi-  ment secured in the advanced period of en-  listing, with untried and to a great extent  turbulent and insubordinate soldiers. Colo-  nel Gansevoort's conduct was worthy of the  highest commendation. After Lee's retreat  the Thirteenth was stationed in \^irginia and  at other posts with troops engaged in watch-  ing the actions of Mosby, and in seeking to  effect his capture, a feat at one time actually  accomplished by a detachment acting under  Colonel Gansevoort's immediate orders.  The escape of Mosby after capture, by his  feigning to be badly wounded and dying,  was an incident of peculiar interest among  the many adventures that attended his  sphere of service. At another time, through  a well-conceived and successfully executed  plan, Colonel Gansevoort was rewarded for  his patience and energy by the capture of  Mosby's artillery, which crippled him and  in a measure defeated his further raids on  the troops stationed in that vicinity. The  duties of this service demanded constant  vigilance and activity, and he discharged  them with zeal and fidelity, at the time fully  acknowledged by the government. His reg-     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     145     iment was among the very last mustered  out of service, and its condition at that time  was not inferior to any other cavalry regi-  ment in the volunteers.   Colonel Gansevoort was brevetted briga-  dier-general of volunteers and lieutenant-  colonel in the regular service, and held at  the time of his death the rank of captain of  artillery in the regular line of promotion in  the United States army. After the close of  the war he was ordered to Fortress Monroe  and thence to Barrancas, Florida, and from  the latter place to Fort Independence, Bos-  ton Harbor. During his long period of ser-  \ ice he was several times prostrated with  fever, the germs of which appeared to re-  main in his system and to cause at intervals  new attacks. He was thus prostrated anew  in the fall of 1870, and when the fever had  nearly abated he sought his home at Al-  bany, where he arrived with a bad cough  which constantly increased upon him. Not  long after his return he insisted on going  back to Boston, and although his strength  seemed not to warrant it he had so de-  terminedly made up his mind to go that  remonstrance was without avail ;' and it is  evident that his chief purpose was to ar-  range such affairs as he had been unable to  attend to during his illness. His visit to  Nassau, New Providence, which failed to  give him any hopes of a restoration to  health ; his yearning for home and its com-  forts and consolations: his homeward jour-  ney in company with his sister who could  not be kept from his side; his gradually  wasting strength as he neared that home,  the goal of his earthly hopes, on the bosom  of his beloved river; his consciousness of  the death soon to close over him ; and his  readiness to meet his end, firm in his honor  as a soldier and humble in his faith as a  Christian — these scenes follow in sad but  quick succession upon all that was earthly  of the beloved object of this sketch.   Colonel Gansevoort had taste in drawing  and painting and was a devoted lover of  history; and his inclination for oratory was  very strong. He also had a taste for writ-  ing, and from boyhood he was distinguished  for his readiness in debate and the facility  with which he could express his thoughts.  When he left Albany Academy he delivered  the salutatory oration, and his address at     Princeton when he graduated is remem-  bered as conspicuous among the exercises of  the day. On one occasion at Allentown,  Pennsylvania, he delivered an Independence  Day address which was spoken of in terms  of warm commendation. While in the army  he was frequently called upon to act on  courts-martial, where his powers were thor-  oughly tested and his ability conspicuously  exhibited, and he was undeviatingly honor-  able, and the possession of this admirable  trait was fully recognized by all who came  in contact with him. Notwithstanding his  decided political convictions, it was a part  of his creed that the duties of a soldier were  incompatible with any active participation  in political strifes ; and as he never was  troubled with misgivings when the path of  duty lay clear before him, the adoption of  this article of faith without hesitation was  followed by a strict adherence to its injunc-  tions from which he never departed.     The Pruyn arms : Shield, a  PRUYN field of gold or saffron, on  which are placed three mart-  lets of natural color, without beaks or feet,  turned to the fore part (dexter side), one in  the base of the shield and the remaining two  in chief, at either side ; crest, a barred or  tournament helmet adorned with a mantling  of gold or saffron and black, on the top of  which, on a twisted band (wreath) or dia-  dem of the ancient kings, of the same col-  ors, between two wings of yellow or gold,  is placed a martlet like those on the shield,  but having feet and beak, looking toward  the dexter side, like all of these are seen de-  picted. (The last phrase refers to a draw-  ing given on a Dutch parchment of 1527).   (I) Johannes (John) Pruyn, a Hollander,  was the progenitor of the family in America.  It is believed that his immediate family was  confined to two sons, Francis, see forward,  and Jacques, Jacus or Jacob. The latter  was enrolled among the 'Small Burghers'  of New Amsterdam, April 18. 1657. He pur-  chased a house and lot 'outside of the Gate  of this city,' February 19, 1659, from Sy-  bout Classen.   Those of the first three generations in this  country varied at times the spelling of the  fpmily name, appearing as Pruyn. Pruyne,  Pryne and Pruen.     146     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     (II) Francis Pruyn (who frequently  wrote his name Pruen) was called Frans  Jansen, because the son of Johannes (John)  Pruyn, and he was in Albany, New York,  with his wife, Aeltje (or Alida), as early as  1665, when he was a tailor. It is recorded  that in 1668, representing Jacques Cornelise  Van Slyck, he conveyed a piece of property  in the colony of Renssclaerswyck (later Al-  bany) to one Jan Labatie, and later in the  same year bought for himself a lot at the  northwest corner of Maiden Lane and James  street, in that city. On February 19, 1686-  87, he bought from Johannes Clute and wife,  Bata, for which he paid the sum of two and  twenty beavers, a lot on Broadway, Albany,  about' the third south from Steuben street,  running through to James street. His son,  Johannes, afterwards occupied the same  house built thereon. Being a Papist, in Jan-  uary, 1699. he refused to take the oath of  allegiance to King William, but expressed  himself as willing to swear fidelity. How-  ever, his son, Johannes Pruyn, subscribed.  His wife, Alida, joined the Reformed Prot-  estant Dutch church in 1683. She died Sep-  tember 20, 1704, and he died May 6, 171 2.

In  1703, he was one of those 'who furnished  labor or materials for the Dominie's house.'  In 1720 his name appears on the list of-  freeholders in the old third ward of Albany.  He lived, between 1703-27, at the northeast  corner of Maiden Lane and James street.  Albany.

W'hen thirteen years old he entered  the office of the Van Rensselaer estate, his  uncle. Robert Dunbar, being the agent to con-  duct affairs of the extensive property. When  Mr. Dunbar resigned, in 1835, he was ap-  pointed agent for the Manor. It was a posi-  tion requiring considerable executive ability,  and he filled the post with satisfaction. When  General Stephen Van Rensselaer, the Patroon,  died January 26. 1839, the estate was divided,  that portion on the east shore of the Hudson  river going to William Paterson Van Rens-  selaer, so Mr. Pruyn removed across the river  to Bath. Rensselaer county, to be in the vi-  cinity, and became the agent of what was  called the 'East Manor,' continuing as such  until the autumn of 1844, when he resigned.  He died February 11, 1846.

(\TII) Hon. Robert Hewson Pruyn, son of  Casparus Francis and Ann (Hewson) Pruyn,  was born in Albany, New York, February 14.  181 5. and was baptized by the Rev. John  Melancthon Bradford, pastor of the 'North'  Dutch Reformed Church. His home life in  childhood trained him in reverence, patriot-  ism and industry, attributes which gave him  prominence in after years. In 1825 he en-  tered the Albany Academy, where his classic-  al education under Dr. Theodoric Romeyn  Beck and his education in the sciences under  Professor Joseph Henry, the eminent scientist-  discoverer, was most thorough. He then en-  tered Rutgers College, from which he was  graduated in 1833. On leaving college he be-  came a law student in the office of Hon. Abra-  ham Van Vechten, a jurist of recognized abil-  ity, city recorder, senator, assemblyman, at-  torney-general and member of the constitu-  tional convention of 1821. Mr. Priiyn was  admitted to the bar in 1836, and shortly after  was appointed attorney and counselor for the  corporation of Albany, holding office for three  years, and for a like period was a member of  the city council, in which body he w^as one  of the most active members in public affairs.  He was judge-advocate from 1841 to 1846, on  the staffs of Governors William H. Seward,  W'illiam C. Bouck and Silas Wright Jr. ; mem-  ber of assembly in 1848-49-50 from the third  district of Albany county, a member of the  WHiig party. In 1850 he was the Whig candi-  date for speaker of assembly. The Demo-  crats had a tie vote with the Whigs, but it  having become apoarent to Mr. Pruyn that one  of the Whig members could not properly hold  his seat. Mr. Pruyn abstained from voting,  and the Democratic candidate was chosen.  The appreciation of this high-minded course  was shown shortly afterward. The speaker  was called home by family affliction, and  the Democrats elected Mr. Pruyn speaker     148     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     pro tempore. In 185 1 Mr. Pruyn was again  appointed judge-advocate general, this time  by Governor Washington Hunt. In 1854  he was again an assemblyman and chosen  speaker. In that office he displayed courage  and such marked justice that never was there  a single one of his rulings in the chair ap-  pealed from. Governor Myron II. Clark, on  March 5, 1855, appointed him adjutant-gen-  eral, and in i860, when there was intense ex-  citement in politics, he came within sixty-two  votes of being elected to the assembly, al-  though the Lincoln electoral ticket liad ten-  fold that majority, in that district alone,  against it.   President Lincoln appointed Mr. Pruyn  United States minister to Japan, as successor  to the Hon. Townsend Harris, in September,  1861, who was the first diplomatic rejjrcscnta-  tive of any country to that isolated kingdom.  It was at a time when it was most essential for  this country to be represented by a man of  firmness and possessing strong convictions of  his own in order to maintain an equality among  the great powers. There being no cable com-  munication, nor even steamship intercourse at  that time, the minister was largely left to exert  his own resourcefulness and responsibility  more largely rested on him than on the diplo-  mats sent later by this country. It was com-  mon occurrence that if an inquiry regarding  the policy to be pursued on a certain feature  were sent to Washington, the reason for it  might have so changed by the time of receiving  the reply that the minister found it necessary  to act along a far difTerent course. He was  thus forced to contest for influence among the  trained diplomats of the world, and while the  task was undoubtedly enormous, even so much  higher in the public's estimation did he rise.   In 1863 two naval expeditions were under-  taken against the transgressing Daimio of  Chosu. whose vessels had fired on the Ameri-  can merchant steamer 'Pembroke.' The  allied forces in the latter engagement demol-  ished the fortifications of Chosu. and Mr.  Pruyn demanded an indemnity of three mil-  lion dollars or, in lieu, the onening of new  ports. Later on the sum of $1,300,000 was  turned over to the state department at Wash-  ington, and the effect of the .American repre-  sentative's insistence was so salutary that it  exerted a lasting benefit, opening the eyes of  Japan as a nation to white men's methods so     as to be the true initiative of its desire for  education and the modern methods of the  powers. Minister Pruyn became an authority  for all America on the arts and institutions  of Japan, and in apprising the state depart-  ment through his voluminous reports on his  observations and reasons for his acts, fur-  nished much beneficial information. On his  return to the United States in 1867, Minister  Pruyn was the candidate for lieutenant-gov-  ernor but was not elected, and an attack of  diphtheria at that time caused him to retire  from public life for a few years. In 1872  Governor John T. Hoffman appointed him on  a non-partisan commission to frame amend-  ments to the state constitution, and this im-  portant body made him its presiding officer.   Mr. Pruyn was chosen the president of the  National Commercial Bank of Albany, an in-  stitution noted for its soundness throughout  the civil war, when it afforded great aid to  the government, and for more than half a  century it continued to be a depository for the  general funds of the state of New York. He  was vice-president of the Albany Savings  Bank ; a trustee of the Metropolitan Trust  Company, of New York City ; trustee of  Rutgers' College ; president of the board of di-  rectors of the Dudley Observatory; vice-  president of the board of trustees of the Al-  bany Medical College, and on the executive  committee of the State Normal College ; mem-  ber of The Albany Institute, and of the Young  Men's Association, being its president in  1838, and a governor of the Fort Orange  Club. He was made a Mason in Master's  Lodge. No. 5, before he left for Japan, and  upon his return was connected with the An-  cient and Accepted Scottish Rite, delivering  the oration at the dedication of the Temple  in September, 1875.   Mr. Pruyn brought from Japan a great  number of rare art treasures, and his collec-  tion of carved ivories is regarded as one of  the finest in the world. He received the de-  gree of M. A. from Rutgers in 1865, and of  LL.D from Williams. He was devoted to his  church and advanced its work very materially,  and all who knew him bear witness to his  honor, charity and unusual qualities of intel-  lect. He died Sunday, February 26, 1882, of  embolism of the brain, and was buried in the  Pruyn family lot in the Albany Rural ceme-  tery on the 28th.

(IX) Robert Clarence, son of Hon. Robert  Hewson and Jane Ann (Lansing) Pruyn, was  born in Albany, New York, October 23, 1847.  His early education was received at the Al-  bany Boys' Academy, following which care-  ful preparation he entered Rutgers College,  graduating in the class of 1869. For a time  he was an attache to the American legation at  Tokio, while his father was the United States  minister to Japan. Governor John A. Dix ap-  pointed him upon his stafif. On February 13,  1901, the legislature elected him a regent of  the University of the State of New York, on  which prominent board he served until its  reorganization in 1903, along the lines of new  legislative enactment. Mr. Pruyn was for a  long time president of the board of commis-  sioners of Washington Park of Albany, until  the park system became a bureau in the de-  partment of public works. He was one of the  commissioners appointed te erect the new City  Hall at Albany, the corner-stone of which was  laid in 1 88 1. He is a member of St. Peter's  Episcopal Church, and for many years has  been a vestryman, participating most actively  in all affairs concerning the good of that  church, and has served a number of times as     delegate to national conventions of the Epis-  copal church in America.   Mr. Pruyn was chosen president of the Na-  tional Commercial Bank of Albany, May 23,  1885, to succeed Hon. Daniel Manning, ap-  pointed by President Cleveland that spring on  his cabinet as secretary of the treasury, and  who had in turn succeeded Mr. Pruyn's  father as president of the bank. It was during  the officiate of Mr. Pruyn that this bank  erected its own building at Nos. 38-40 State  street, on the line of plans executed by Archi-  tect Robert W. Gibson, but the remarkable ex-  pansion of its affairs soon necessitated the con-  sideration of acquiring much larger quarters,  and on May 2, 1904, this bank removed to its  new, handsome granite and marble building at  No. 60 State street. The exterior of this  edifice is a chief adornment of Albany's prin-  cipal business street, and the interior, com-  modious and replete with all modern methods  for convenience of customers and officials, is  a subject of unstinted admiration because of  its refined beauty combined with a certain  amount of ornateness. Equally as good a  barometer of its success and progressiveness  under the executive guidance of Mr. Pruyn is  the fact that the stock of this bank has en-  hanced in value.   For several years Mr. Pruyn was vice-presi-  dent of the Municipal Gas Company, of Al-  bany, and the president of the Albany Rail-  way Company, the two largest corporations  operated in the Capitol City. He is a director  of the Union Trust Company, and was one of  its leading organizers ; member of the board  of governors of the Albany Hospital : director  of the Albany Institute and Historical and Art  Society; member of Philip Livingston Chap-  ter, Sons of the Revolution ; of the Holland  Society; the Albany Chamber of Commerce;  Century Association ; of the University and  Metropolitan clubs of New York City; the  Fort Orange, the Albany, the University and  the Country clubs of Albany, and also the  Jekyl Island Club.   Mr. Pruyn's residence is at No. 7 Engle-  wood place, fronting on the most beautiful  portion of Albany's famous Washington Park.  The interior exhibits a peculiar charm of re-  finement in its furnishings, and one of its  most admired features is the collection of  ivories brought to this country from Japan by  his father, which is ranked as one of 'the finest     150     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     in this country. He spends his summers on  his Adirondack preserve, known as Camp  Santanoni, attractively located on Newcomb  Lake, and reached by a drive of about thirty  miles northward from North Creek station.  It is here that Mr. and Mrs. Pruyn surround  themselves with their family, and from ten to  twenty or more guests at a time. They de-  light in the pleasure of entertaining, and are  true to the dictum of the old Dutch hospi-  tality. In the winter it has been his custom  to spend several weeks at Jekyl Island, as a  member of that southern club. He is espe-  cially concerned in everything pertaining to art  in its best form; enjoys riding, books and  travel.   Robert C. Pruyn married, at Albany, Octo-  ber 22, 1873. Anna Martha, born in Albany.  May 7, 1853, daughter of Chauncey Pratt  Williams, late president of the National Ex-  change Bank of Albany, and Martha Andrews  (Hough) Williams.

(X) Robert Dunbar, son of Robert Clar-  ence and Anna Martha (Williams) Pruyn,  was born in .Albany, New York, October 11,  1879. He was educated at the Albany .\cad-  emy, then at St. Paul's School of Concord,  New Hampshire, 1894-98, after which he en-  tered Harvard University and graduated in  1902. He entered the employ of the Con-  solidated Car-Heating Company at Albany,  in 1902, of which his father was the presi-  dent, but the family inclination for the bank-  ing business determined a change, and since  1004 he has been located in New York City  with the banking firms of Redmond &• Com-  pany, at first, and latterly with Kidder, Pea-  body & Company, of Wall street. He is a  Republican and Episcopalian ; has traveled,  and is fond of the refined pleasures. He is  a member of The Brook Club, Racquet &  Tennis Club and the Harvard Club. His resi-     dence, since removing from .\lbany, is at Mt.  Kisco, New York. He married, in the Church  of the Ascension of New York City, Decem-  ber 15, 1903, Betty Metcalf, born at Erie,  Pennsylvania, September 30, 1880, daughter  of Frederic Wilder and Ruth (Moorhead)  Metcalf. Children: Robert Lansing, born at  New York City, November 5, 1904; Ruth,  Ijorn at New York City, May 5, 1907.     The name Calvert is an his-  C.-\L\'ERT toric one in Yorkshire, Eng-  land. It has been a well-known  name in York since the eleventh century.  Some authorities claim that Calvert was a  name brought into England at the time of the  Norman Conquest, and others that it ante-  dated in York the date of that conquest.  There are a number of families bearing the  Calvert name now living in York, and moss-  grown tombstones of their ancestors are to be  found in the burying grounds. The Calverts  of .'\rmagh, county of Armagh, province of  Ulster, Ireland, are descendants of Rev. Hen-  ry Calvert, a Presbyterian minister who mi-  grated from Yorkshire, England, or from  over the border in Scotland, in 1623, and set-  tled in county Down. One chronicler says  he migrated from Scotland. He was probably  English with an infusion of Scottish blood. He  married a Miss Blair, of Scotland, whose  brother was a Presbyterian clergyman, at  Bangor, coimty Down. He refused to con-,  form to Episcopacy and was put out of his  church in 1636. Under James I., and later  under Charles II., because of a strong policy  of religious repression, I'lster received large  immigration of Scottish and English settlers,  as America in more recent years received a  large influx from Ireland. Lord Baltimore  (Leonard Calvert), who with his brother  Cecil came to America and founded the city  of Baltimore, was born in Kepling. Yorkshire,  in 158::. The Calverts who migrated from  Yorksliire to .'\rma,gh and the Lord Baltimore  Calverts were presumably of the same stock.  There is a tradition handed down by the Cal-  verts of Central New York that the families  sustained friendly relationship and exchanged  visits in the mother country. The Calverts  now living in .Vrmagh and Dublin are children  of John Calvert, who died in .Krmagh. No-  vember 19. 1873, lineal descendant of the Cal-  verts, of Yorkshire.     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     151     (I) John Calvert, the head of the Cortland,  New York, branch of the Calvert family,  came to America from Armagh in 1792. His  wife having previously died he brought with  him his seven children, six sons, John, Na-  thaniel, \\'illiam, Robert, Alexander, Thomas,  and one daughter, Margaret. After their ar-  rival the family remained in New York City  for a few years. The father was a Scotch  Covenanter of extreme type and in order to  be in close proximity to the Scotch Cove-  nanter and Presbyterian colonies, in Galway,  and other towns of Washington county, he  sailed up the Hudson with his family and lo-  cated on a farm in that county. \\'ith the  opening of the new century, borne along by  the tide of immigration that had been moving  westward from New England since the close  of the revolutionary struggles, John Calvert  purchased in 1800 a Soldier's Land Claim,  known as Lot 82, a plot of three hundred acres  of thicklv wooded land inclufling the present  site of Virgil, Cortland county, and moved on  to it. He was among the earliest settlers of  Cortland county. The hardships and priva-  tions which the family had to endure were  those incident to the life of all pioneers of a  hundred or more years ago.   After clearing away the forests, building a  log house, and making other needed improve-  ments, the farm was sold and a tract of land  purchased, including what has been long  known as the LeRoy Gillett farm, southwest  ■ of Cortland. Here again a house was built  and improvements were made, after which the  place was sold to advantage, and purchase was  made in about 1806 of one hundred and fifty  to two hundred acres situated a little south of  South Cortland, forming a part of what is  still known as the 'Calvert Homestead.' The  remnants of an old orchard at the right of  the road across the field shows where the old  log house formerly stood. In this house,  which he built, John Calvert lived only about  two years, for his end came peacefully in  1808. after a laborious, honorable and highly  useful life. He was a man much esteemed  for his good judgment, integritv, nobility and  exalted standards of life. He sleeps in the  little cemetery at South Cortland.   Upon the death of his father, John Calvert  Jr.. mentioned below, succeeded to the head-  ship of the family. William and Nathaniel  found homes in Crawford countv, in western     Pennsylvania. Nathaniel had sons by the  names of John and Joseph. Robert settled in  Livingston county. New York. He had sons  by the names of John, William and Joseph.  Alexander lived and died in Cayuga county.  Thomas with his son John and daughter Mar-  garet went to Illinois some time about 1840.  The only daughter, Margaret, married Thom-  as McKee and lived in Cayuga county. John  was a family name, and the eldest son was  usually named John.   (H) John (2), son of John (i) Calvert, was  seventeen years of age when he landed with his  father in New York and was consequently  thirty-three when he succeeded to the head-  ship of the family. He had married Isabella  Story, a woman of rare good sense, great  strength of character and earnest piety, and  being equally yoked together, they looked out  upon life with resolute courage and faith.  Shortly after assuming his new responsibili-  ties, he purchased an adjoining farm, making  with what he already possessed a choice tract  of from three hundred and fifty to four hun-  dred acres. Subsequently other additions  were made until he had about six hundred  acres. Some of this land remains in the hands  of his descendants until this day. In 183 1 he  built the large frame house south of South  Cortland which the- family occupied until all  the children were married. He accumulated a  large property for his day. After a brief ill-  ness he died June 6, 1846, in the seventy-  second year of his age. His widow, who sur-  .■ived him. died July 22, 1858. and now sleeps  by the side of her husband in the Cortland  Rural cemetery. They lived and died in the  strict religious tenets of the Scotch Cove-  nanter faith and in the fellowship of the  Covenanter church of Sterling, New York.

On December 22, 1846, he married  Olive Adaline Betts, second daughter of  Hiram and Lydia (Blodgett) Betts, of Cort-  land. She was of hardy Connecticut ancestry,  her family being American in the sense in  which Richard Grant White said the word  should be used, as her ancestors had come to  New England before the revolution. A daugh-  ter, Mary M., was born on the Calvert home-  .stead. In the early fifties the homestead was  sold, and the family moved to a newly pur-  chased farm in Preble. The son, John B., men-  tioned below, was born there. In the spring of  1854 the family moved to Homer, where they  resided on various farms until the spring of  1864, when they took up their residence in  Cortland. While in Homer three daughters,  Ella M., Emma L., Anna M., were born,  making five children altogether. Because of  the father's ill health, necessitating a milder  climate, the family, in the spring of 186S,  moved to New Brunswick, New Jersey. In  that city the mother died on September 23,  1869, and in the December following the fam-  ily moved back to Cortland. On September  3, 1872, James A. Calvert was married in  I?rooklyn, New York, to Emily Haviland,  sister of James and Henry Haviland, of that  city. He continued to reside in Cortland un-  til his death, April 13, 1887. He inherited an  honored name and he honored it by his pure  and godly life. Like his father he was es-  teemed for his integrity, exalted character,  right living and his fraternal and peace-loving  spirit.   Children: i. Mary M., married Dr. A.  Gaylord Slocum.

(IV) John Betts, only son of James Alex-  ander Calvert, was born in Preble, August 29,  1852. After studying at various schools, he  was principal of the high school at McLean,  1871-72. He entered the University of Roch-  ester, at Rochester, New York, in the fall  of 1872, and was graduated in 1876. In Sep-  tember, 1876, he entered the Union Theologi-  cal Seminary in New York City, from which  he was graduated in May, 1879. The degree  of A. M. was conferred upon him the follow-  ing June by his alma mater. He was licensed  to preach by the First Baptist Church of Cort-  land. New York, ]\Iarch 20. 1875. During the  last two years in the seminary he supplied the  Baptist church at Graniteville. Staten Island.  He also contributed quite frequently to The  Examiner. Zioii's Advocate, and The Stand-  ard. Although designed for the ministry, he  got a taste for newspaper work and formed  acquaintanceships which finally led him into  journalism. In October, 1879. he was chosen  secretary of The Baptist Missionary Conven-  tion of the State of New York, a society that  for more than a century has been aiding Bap-  tist churches in the state. He served as sec-  retary for seven years, five of which he was  also assistant pastor of Calvary Church, New  York. He was ordained in Calvary Church,  October 19, t88o. When he resigned the sec-  retaryship of the Convention at Poughkeepsie,  in October, 1886, he was unanimously chosen  president, which position he filled for twenty-  one years. He is still a member of the board.  On December 10, 1885, he married Mary  Dows Mairs, of New York. In February,  1888, he purchased The Baptist Weekly and  changed the name to The Christian Inquirer.  He was editor of the paper and president of  the publishing company seven years. In 1894  he received the degree of D. D. from Shurtlefif  College. In March, 1895, The Christian In-  quirer was consolidated with The E.vamincr.  and he became one of the stockholders of  The Examiner Company and one of the edi-  tors of The Examiner. He continued in this  relation until he went abroad for an extended  trip in 1910. He still has his office with The  E.raminer.   He has traveled extensively in his own     country, his journeys extending from Florida  to Alaska and from Nova Scotia to Southern  California. His travels in Europe embrace  the chief points of interest from Great Britain  to Egypt and Palestine. He is deeply inter-  ested in the cause of education, and has been  a trustee of the University of Rochester since  1899. He served for ten years as trustee of  Cook Academy, and for five years as presi-  dent of the board. He served as president of  the New York Alumni Association of the  University of Rochester for two years, and  as president of the Phi Beta Kappa of the  University during 1S99-1900, and is now a  member of Phi Beta Kappa Alumni of New  York. He has also served as president of the  Baptist Social Union and of the Cortland  Cotmty Society, of New York. On the oc-  casion of the celebration of 'Old Home  Week' in Cortland in 1908, he preached a  Home Coming sermon at the Baptist church  on Sunday morning, and made one of the ad-  dresses at the public celebration. He is presi-  dent of the board of trustees of the Metropol-  itan College of Music, and president of the  American Seamen's Friend Society of New  York.     The historv of the Bench  HIRSCHBERG and Bar of the State of   New York is one of bril-  liancy and honor, and nobly has the prestige  established by the judges and counsellors of  the past been maintained by their successors  of the present day. Among the foremost of  these stands Michael Henry Hirschberg, judge  of the appellate division, second department  of the supreme court of the state of New  York. Judge Hirschberg resides in Newburg,  and for many years prior to his elevation to  the bench was a recognized leader of the bar  of the Empire State.   (T) Henrv M. Hirschberg. father of Mich-  ael Henry Hirschberg, was born July 21, 1814,  in Poland. He received an academic educa-  tion in his native land. At the age of twenty  he went to England, where for six years he  was employed as a commercial traveller. In  1841 he emigrated to the United States, land-  ing in New Orleans, November 13, of that  year, and remaining until the following spring,  when he removed to New York. In that city  he secured employment as a clerk in a cloth-  ing store, and in 1843 returned to England.     154   In 1845 he came once more to the United  States/setthng this time in Newburg, New  York, where he engaged in the clothing busi-  ness on his own account. The enterprise  prospered, and until a few years prior to his  death Mr. Hirschberg conducted a flourishing  establishment. He became a man of promi-  nence in the community, was associated in  politics with the Democrats, and served for  three years as commissioner of excise, _ for a  portion of that time holding the position of  president of the board. In 1875-81-83 he  served as supervisor, and was also appointed  local civil service commissioner. For twenty-  five years Mr. Hirschberg was one of the  trustees of the Newburg Savings Bank. In  1854 he was elected a member of Newburg  Lodge. Free and Accepted Masons, in 1858  was chosen master, and in 1876 was elected  treasurer, holding the latter position to the  close of his life. He was for seventeen years  president of Congregation Beth Jacob. Mr.  Hirschberg married, in 1844, in England,  Frances Francks, of Newcastle, Staffordshire,  and among their children was a son. Michael  Henry, mentioned below. Mr. Hirschberg  filed .August 16, 1886, in Newburg, leaving the  memory of an able business man and an up-  right, public-spirited citizen.   (II) Michael Henry, son of Henry M. and  Frances (Francks) Hirschberg, was bof'  .'\pril 12, 1847, in Newburg, New York. He  received his education at the Free Academy,  graduating in 1862. After his admission to  the bar in May, 1868, he began practice in his  native city, his steady and rapid advancement  speedily proving his possession, in full meas-  ure, of the essential qualities of a successful  lawyer. From 1873 to 1878 he was special  county judge of Orange county, and in i88g  he was elected district attorney of that county,  serving until 1895. Intense application, pro-  found and comprehensive knowledge of his  profession and unusual facility in grasping  and even anticipating the points advanced by  his adversary made his record a brilliant one  and caused his tenure of ofiice to be memora-  ble in the legal annals of the county. In i8g6  Mr. Hirschberg was elected justice of the su-  preme court of the state of New York, and  in iQoo was assigned to the appellate division,  second department. Brooklyn. In January,  1004, he was appointed presiding justice for  a term expiring December ,v, 1910. The     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     qualifications of Judge Hirschberg for his ex-  alted position have never been questioned and  are universally acknowledged to be of the  highest order, chief among them being the  judicial mind which he possesses in an extra-  ordinary degree. His decisions are remarka-  ble for knowledge of the law, lucidity of ex-  pression, depth of insight and vigor and origi-  nality of thought. On February 10, 1910,  Judge Hirschberg received the tribute of a  nomination on the Republican, Democratic  and Independent-League tickets for judge of  the supreme court, being subsequently given  the further tribute of an election. In 191 1 he  was reappointed by Governor Dix to the ap-  pellate (iivision, second department, which of-  fice he now holds. Judge Hirschberg's pro-  fessional career, now in its fifth decade, is  filled with achievement to a degree not always  found in records of even fifty years' service  on the bench and at the bar, but to a man of  his type, in the full maturity of his powers,  the future always holds promise of greater  things to come. In 1894 Judge Hirschberg  was state delegate to the constitutional con-  vention. His club membership includes the  Republican, Manhattan, Lawyers', Hamilton,  Brooklyn. Powellton and Newburg City. In  everything pertaining to the welfare and prog-  ress of his community he takes an active in-  terest, and the educational and charitable in-  stitutions which constitute so vital an element  in the life of every city have received the  benefit of his influence and co-operation.  From 1 87 1 to 1883 he was a member of the  board of education of the City of Newburg,  and for several years its president.   Judge Hirschberg married, March 16, 1878.  Lizzie, daughter of Thomas S. and Mary  (Robinson) McAlles, of Newburg, and they  are the parents of the following children :  Henry, born February 12, 1879; Stuart Mc-  Alles, May 8, 1886: Mary Frances, April 23,  1887, married Abner M, Harper: David Scott,  September 8. 1893. Judge Hirschberg and his  family are prominent and popular in the social  circles of their home city and also in those of  New York.     The family name of Kings-   KINGSBURY bury takes us back to the   days of the .Saxon Kings,   — as the name of a place.

The Kingsbury arms: Several different  coats are associated with the name. One ac-  tually in use in this country at the end of the  eighteenth century was : Argent, a fesse azure  between three eagles displayed of the same.  Another confirmed in 1742 to Dr. Thomas  Kingsbury, descended from the Kingsburys of  county Dorset, was : Azure, a chevron or, be-  tween two doves in chief, proper, and a ser-  pent in base, nowed of the last.

Crest, a demi lion ram-  pant, or. Motto: Viiicit amor patriae.   The ancient name of the place in Somerset-  shire referred to was Kingsbury Episcopii, and  the manor was held by the Bishop of Bath  and Wells. Kingsbury in Warwickshire be-  longed to the famous Countess Godiva, and in  the Domesday Book is called 'Chinesburie.'  Leofric, Earl of Mercia, her husband, was de-  scended from the Saxon Kings of Mercia, and  inherited their ancient seat. Leofric's grand-  daughter married Turchil de Arden, one of  the Conqueror's Norman knights, and their  granddaughter married Peter de Bracebridge.  in whose family the lordship of Kingsbury  remained until the time of Queen Elizabeth.  A daughter of this race married Sir John  Arden, of Arden, who was either the grand-  father or crreat-uncle of Mary Arden, Shakes-  peare's mother. The Bracebridges lived at  Kingsbury Hall, and in the church in Kings-  bury their arms may be seen impaled with  those of the family of Francis, which are a  chevron argent, between three eagles dis-  played gules. These charges are nearly the  same as those of the old Kingsbury coat-of-  arms used by Hon. Andrew Kingsbury of  Hartford, about one hundred years ago, but  in those azure is substituted for gules. Kings-  bury Hall is described as 'a house of Henrv  VII. 's time, built with its great manor-court  chamber within a fortress, of which the cur-     tain wall and the octagonal towers remain,  probably of the time of King John.'   The Alanor of Kingsbury in the Hundred of  Caishoe, county Herts, was so termed from the  Sa.xon Kings, who were the ancient possessors  thereof, and often resided and kept their Court  there, among whom Bertulph, King of the Mer-  cians, celebrated a Parliamentary Council there on  Friday after Easter, in the year of Christ 851.  * * * There was a stately Pallace that belonged  to the Castle of Kingsbury, situated at the west end  of the Town of St. .'Mbans, where the Saxon Kings  delighted much, and their Nobles and Officers so  often resorted thither that they became a great  Burden and Charge to the Abbot and Monks of  St. Albans, which induced them to purchase it ;  and after they had made many Addresses to the  King for it. -Alfric, who had been Chancellor to  King Etheldred, whilst he was a Secular, prevailed  with the King to sell to them all the royal Mannor  of Kingsbury, with the Parks and Woods belonging  to it, e.xcepting one small Fortress near the Mon-  astery, which the King would not sufifer to be de-  molisht, that the Marks of his Royal House might  not be forgotten ; and the Abbot and Monks bought  and enjoyed it till the time of the Dissolution, when  it returned to the Crown. Through various hands  it passed to Sir Francis Bacon, Viscount Verulam,  Keeper of the Great Seal (the great Lord Bacon),  but when the Seal was taken from him, and he  retired from the Court, he sold it. — (Historical an-  tiquities of Hertfordshire bv Sir Henrv Chauncv,  Kt,. II, 314.)   King Edward the Confessor gave to West-  minster Abbey a third of the forest growing  in his wood at Kyngsbury, lying in the Hun-  dred of Goare, about six miles northwest of  London. The name is also found in Domes-  day Book in the form 'Chingesberie,' as a  manor in the Hundred of Plelstine, Middlesex,  held by Ernulf de Hesdings.   The first individual of the name that is  known to us is Gilbert de Kingsbury, who was  the incumbent of St. Peter's Church. Kings-  bury, W'arwickshire, about 1300. He prob-  ably derived his surnaiue from the place. In  1 368 we find a William de Kingsbury men-  tioned in the will of Gervase de Wyllesford,  Rector of Barnak, in Northamptonshire, and  there are a nutnber of ecclesiastics of the  name, such as David Kynnesbury, Vicar of  Cheshunt, Herts, appointed April 12, 1480,  died in 1503. That there were so many of  the name occupying positions calling for edu-  cation and refinement, proves that the family  must have been of some conseqtience, and es-  pecially as several of them were Benedictines,  who were called 'the gentlemanly monks,'  then the most learned in all Europe and re-  cruited from the higher classes of society.     156     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     In the fourteenth century record appears of  a family of Kingsburys in Little Cornard,  county of Suffolk, who appear to have been  substantial landholders, and from whom the  original Kingsbury emigrants to this country  are undoubtedly descended. James Kings-  bury of Boxford, county of Suffolk, married  Anne ffrancis, and died in 1622, leaving eight  children, James. Henry, John, Elizabeth,  Sarah. Joseph, Thomas and Alyce. Of these,  three. Henry. John and Joseph, came to New  England, and a fourth, Thomas, agreed to  crime, but apparently did not do so (Win-  throp's New England I. 369, 375; H, 340).  The first to arrive was Henry, who came on  the 'Talbot' in Governor Winthrop's fleet in  1630. Governor Winthrop wrote to his wife  'From aboard the Arabella, riding at the  Cowes March 28. 1630,' just before the de-  parture from England, 'Henry Kingsbury  hath a child or two in the Talbot sick with  the measles, but like to do well.' Henry  Kingsbury married Margaret, widow of  Thomas Alabaster, a relative of Governor  Winthrop. He settled in Boston, but appar-  ently returned later to England. Henry  Kingsbury of Ipswich and Haverhill, from  whom the following genealogy is traced, ap-  pears to have been either the son of Henry,  the first emigrant, by an earlier marriage, or  the son of Thomas who remained in England,  probably the latter. The records are not whol-  ly clear or conclusive on this point. The fam-  ilv record in America thus begins with Henry  Kingsbury of Ipswich.   d) Henry Kingsbury was at Ipswich in  1638, according to Felt's History, and the  'Hammatt Papers' state he was a commoner  in Ipswich in 1641. He was a subscriber to  the Major Denison fund, December 19. 1648,  in the sum of two shillings. On February 8.  1648. according to records, he sold his farm  in Ipswich, consisting of 32 acres, for 25 Eng-  lish pounds, to Thomas Safford ; but this does  not signify that he then left that place, for  during the same year be bought 'house and  land on High St, in Ipswich', from Daniel  I^dd of Haverhill, which he sold August 30,  1660. to Robert Lord, obtaining two oxen in  hanrl. five pounds to he paid Robert Paine, and  forty shillings to Edmund Bridges. That  .■?amc year he also sold six acres to Reinold  Foster. He was one of the residents of Ips-  wich who on May 17. iG:,R. signed a petition     stating that they had taken the oath of fidelity,  but were not freemen, yet they claimed the  right to vote in town affairs. In 1661-62-63,  he was overseer 'for Pentucket side,' for  fences and highways in Rowley. His farm  was on the Merrimack, in that part of Rowley  afterwards Bradford. On March 3, 1667-68,  'it was voted and granted that Henry Kings-  bury shall have ten acres of land which is to  be laid out unto him, adjoining to Mr. Ward's  farm, to the west of Hawke's meadow path,  not prejudicing any other man.' In 1669 he  gave a deposition in court, stating that he was  fifty-four years old, hence it is determined that  he was born in 1615. and he died in Haverhill,  October i, 1687. The inventor}- was taken  October 10, 1687, and amounted to 40 pounds,  19 shillings, 6 pence.   Henry Kingsbury's wife was named Susan-  na, and she died in Haverhill, February 21,  1678-9. Children: i.

(II) Lieutenant Joseph Kingsbury, son of  Henr\' and Susanna Kingsbury, was born in  1656, died April 9, 1741. He resided in Hav-  erhill, where he took the oath of allegiance,  November 28. 1677. As Sergeant Joseph  Kingsbury, he was chosen constable for the  west part of Haverhill, March 2, 1702-03;  tithingman, March 4, 1 700-01 : selectman.  March, 1697-98-9Q. 1700-01-03-06: viewer of  fences from the Mill brook westward to the  ^^'estbridge river and northward. He was a  surveyor, or capable of performing such du-  ties, for on September 17, 1685, he testified  that he and \^'^illiam Neff were desired by  Thomas Woodbery and Josiah Beason to  measure 'a certayne parcell of upland and  meadow' in Ipswich, and further, 'ye meas-  ure or work above named wee did according to  O'r best skill and judgment.' On May 12,  1702. the town by vote made choice of 'Sergt.  Joseph Kingsbury to appear at the next in-  ferior court, to be holden at .Salem on the last  Tuesday of June next, on the behalf of the  Town of Haverhill, to answer the said Town's  presentment for not being provided with a  school-master according to law.' He was em-  ployed by Captain Simon Wainwright. a mer-  chant in Haverhill, when the captain was  killed by the Indians and his house burned, in  1708. Later in the same, year he moved his  family to Norwich. Connecticut, leaving his  Haverhill home June 14, 1708. He settled in  that portion which was then known as West  Farms, now Franklin, and erected a dwelling  on Middle or Center Hill, property which re-  mained in the Kingsburv name until 1870.  when bought by John G. Cooley of New York  for his son, who had married a daughter of  Colonel Thomas H. C. Kingsbury. He was  chairman of the meeting at which the ecclesi-  astical society of West Farms was organized,  in 1716, and one of the eight pillars of the  church. He and his son Joseph were among  the eight men who drew up the covenant of  the church in 1718. He and his wife were  admitted to the church by letter. January 4,  1 7 18. and he was one of the first two deacons  of the church, chosen October 8. 1718. He  was appointed eii=itrn of the trainband in the  West Society in Norwich, in 1719, and lieu-  tenant in October, 1727.   Lieutenant Joseph Kingsbury married.

Cuff and Phillis, whom he bequeathed to his  wife. Ruth, and she gave them their freedom  in December. 1773.

(VH) Oliver Richmond Kingsbury, son of  Oliver and Cynthia (Wing) Kingsbury, was  born in Worcester, Massachusetts, March 15,.  1809, died in New York City, December 11,  1889. He was brought up in Coventry, Con-  necticut, in the family of his grandfather, and  at the age of thirteen, in March or April, 1822,  removed to New York City, and lived there  the remainder of his life. He entered the ser-  vice of the American Tract Society, where his  uncle, Harlan Page, was engaged, from his  first coming to New York, until the end of his  days ; he became assistant treasurer in 1834,  and was treasurer of the society for many  years before his retirement in 1887. He was  connected with the Presbyterian church for  many years, successively ruling elder in the  Sixth Street, Fourteenth Street, and Central  Presbyterian churches, and he was several  times commissioner to the general assembly.  The following notice appeared in The Ameri-  can Messenger, relating to the action taken by  the American Tract Society at the annual  meeting in May, 1887, with regard to Mr.  Kingsbury :   In accordance with the direction of the E.xecu-  tive Committee, at a special meeting held May 9th,  the following resolution is offered. As Mr. O. R.  Kingsbur\- has stated that on account of increasing  age he would decline a re-election as treasurer, it  was :   RESOLVED, That the society, now assembled in  annual meeting, cannot consent to part with iMr.  Kingsbury as Treasurer without placing on record  its estimate of his long and faithful services, A  youth of 17, he entered the service of tlie society in  1827. in a subordinate capacity. In 1834. he was  elected Assistant Secretary: in 1835 was added the  duty of Assistant Treasurer. He performed the  duties of treasurership from that time until the  present, having received the title of Treasurer in  1870. He has been annuallv elected in this capacity  for 53 years with no dissenting voice. During this  period there passed through the treasury about  $17,000,000, and so far as known not one dollar was  ever lost in connection with his department. Dur-  ing these 60 years he has been out of the office  from illness but once for any length of time, and  only for three months then. Nor has he taken dur-  ing these threescore years, on an average, one week's  vacation per annum. Not a little of the untar-  nished reputation of the Secretary is due to his  calm judgment, clear view of financial questions,  incorruptible integrity, and high Christian character.  Taking into view the multiplicity of interests in-  volved, the amount of money handled in unnum-  bered small sums, the total absence of loss or fail-     i6o     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     lire in payment of notes, and the length of unbroken  service, it will be difficult to find parallels in the  religious or financial institutions of the country.   In connection with this resohition. Rev. Dr.  William Ormiston said that this was a most  marvelous record. He wished for Mr. Kings-  l)ury many years yet of u.^eful life. The reso-  lution was adopted unanimously hy a rising  vote, and he was elected treasurer emeritus.  He was distinguished by a practical bent of  mind ; was a man of sound sense ; possessed  a retiring disposition, and noted as a tnan of  orderly ways and quiet tastes. His office was  to him as sacred as his church, and there the  responsible duties of his earnest life were  faithfully performed.

From the earliest  SCHERMRRHORN bc,ginnings of the   state of New York  this name has been prominently identified  therewith and now lias numerous representa-  tives in various sections of the state and  througlif)ut the Union. It has given the name  to a street of Greater New York and has  been especially identified with business inter-  ests in that city for many generations, though  the founder of the family settled early at  Albany.   d) This family was established in the Mo-  hawk Valley by Jacob Janse Schermerhorn,     born in 1622, in Waterland, Holland, died at  Schenectady, New York, 1689. In 1654 his  father was a resident of Amsterdam, Holland.  At an early day Jacob Janse Schermerhorn  came to Beverwyck, where he became pros-  perous as an Indian trader and brewer. In  1648 he transgressed the law against selling  arms and ammunition to the Indians. He was  tried by order of Governor Stuyvesant and  sentenced to banishment for five years and the  confiscation of his property. Several leading  citizens interfered in his behalf and succeeded  in having the banishment clause of the sen-  tence revoked, but his property was totally  lost. These proceedings against Jacob J.  Schermerhorn formed later a ground for com-  plaint against Stuyvesant to the states-general.  By his will he devised property worth 56,822  guilders (about $23,000), so the old pioneer  soon retrieved his fortunes. His estate was  considered very large at that time, and was  exceeded by few except the patroons and men  of high official rank. He married Jannetje  Segers, a daughter of Cornelius Scgerse Van  Voorhoudt. He made his will May 20, 1688,  and soon after died in Schenectady. He men-  tions in his will children : Ryer ; Symon, see  forward : Helena, married Mynder Harmense  Van Der Bogart; Jacob; Machletdt, married  Johannes Beekman ; Cornelis ; Jannetje, mar-  ried Caspar Springstein; Neeltje, married  Barent Ten Eyck ; Lucas.   (II) Symon, second son of Jacob Janse and  Jannetje Segers (Van \'oorhoudt) Schermer-  horn, was born in Albany, New York. He re-  sided in Schenectady until 1690. He was  among the sufferers in the Indian raid on that  town, which they burned February 9, 1690,  and in the bitter cold of that night he rode  to Albany to carry the news, in spite of hav-  ing been shot through the thigh and his horse  having been also wounded. In 1691 he re-  moved to New York City, where he died about  1696. At the time of the Schenectady  massacre his son Johannes and three negro  servants were killed. He married Willempie  Viele, probably a daughter of Arnout Cor-  nelisse Viele. Two children were baptized in  Albany: Johannes, July 23, 1684, and Arnout.  mentioned below. Two were baptized after  his removal to New York: Maria, July 5.  1693 : Jannetje, March 24, 1695.

He was  educated in private schools, and entered Co-  lumbia College in the class of 1865. He did  not complete the course, as he desired to take  a military training in the United States Mili-  tary Academy at West Point. The outbreak  of the civil war led to his enlistment, in 1864,  in his twentieth year, as a soldier, and he was  commissioned second lieutenant of Company  C. One Hundred and Eighty-fifth Regiment  New York Volunteer Infantry. He was mus-  tered in January, 1865, and went to the front  with the Army of the Potomac, in which he  acted as aide-de-camp to Major-General  Charles Griffin. For gallant conduct at the  battle of Five Forks, Virginia, in 1865, Lieu-  tenant Schermerhorn was brevetted captain  and he continued to serve until peace suc-  ceeded war. Returning to his studies in 1865  he entered the School of Mines of Columbia  College, from which he was graduated in  1868 with the degree of Mining Engineer. He  again became interested in military affairs and  was seven years a member of the National  Guard of the State of New York, entering as  private, and rising through various promotions  to first lieutenant of Company K in the fa-  mous Seventh New York Regiment. Pos-  sessed of independent means Captain Scher-  merhorn has given liberally of his time and  effort, as well as financial support, to the pro-  motion of various philanthropic and progres-  sive societies.

Celtic in origin, the name  MORG.AN Morgan, in the principality of   Wales, is older than the ad-  vent of the Saxon race or language. The  derivation has not been conclusively deter-  mined, but Dixon, an English authority on  surnames, says that it means by sea, or by  the sea, which is probably as nearly accurate  as any explanation may be. The name is al-  lied to the Scotch ceann mor, meaning big  head, or perhaps big headland. Another pos-  sible derivation is from the Welsh more can.  meaning sea burn, which is not essentially  different from the former interpretation, by  the sea.   The name was common at the time of the  Conquest, and appears in the Domesday Book  and in the Battle Abbey Roll. Among the     1 66     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Welsh, several sovereign princes and other  potentates of the Morgan stock were living  as far back as the year 300 or 400. One of  these princes, Morgan of Gla Morgan, in  725, is said to have invented trial by jnry, a  procedure which he called 'the apostolic law.'  'As Christ and the twelve Apostles are finally  to judge the world, so human tribunals should  be composed of the king and twelve wise  men.'' This institution preceded by a century  and a half the time of .Alfred the Great, who  is generally credited with the law.   In the latter part of the sixteenth century  the family from which were derived the an-  cestors of the .American branch, moved from  A\'ales to Bristol. England. The immediate  family of Miles Morgan, who came to Massa-  chusetts, was of Glamorganshire, Wales, and  there is reason to believe that his father was  William Morgan. Among the early families  of the American pioneers there was tradition  of a little book owned by James Morgan, the  brother of Miles Morgan, dated before 1600,  and inscribed with the name of William Mor-  gan of Llandaff. Other evidence in the shape  of antique gold sleeve-buttons stamped 'W.  M.,' in the possession of James Morgan,  pointed to the same conclusion, and these were  said to have been an heirloom from \\'illiam  Morgan of I.landaff.   Arms — or, a griffin segreant sable ; crest — a  reindeer's head couped or, attired gules ; mot-  to — Onward and Upward.   (I) Miles Morgan, who founded the family  of his name in New England, was born prob-  ably in Llandaff, Glamorganshire, Wales,  about 1615. Accompanying his older brother,  James Morgan, who settled in New London,  Connecticut, and John Morgan, who went to  Virginia, he sailed from Bri.stol, England, and  arrived in Boston in April, 1636. His first  residence was in Roxbury, and there it is be-  lieved he remained some years. Subscqucntlv  he joined the company which, led by Sir \\'ill-  iam Pynchon, had founded Agawam (Spring-  field) on the Connecticut river. It is not a  historical certainty that he was with the first  company which went inland from Boston, or  that he was one of the founders of Agawam.  That place was established in 1636. and the  name of Miles Morgan appears on the rec-  ords in 1643, showing that he was there be-  fore that time, but how long before is not  known.     He became one of the leading men of Aga-  wam. He acquired an extensive tract of land,  and was also a trader, sailing a vessel up and  down the river. One of the few fortified  houses in Agawam belonged to him, and he  was one of the leaders of the militia, having  the rank of sergeant. In all the fighting in  which the little settlement was engaged to  protect itself from the attack of the surround-  ing ravages, he was much depended upon for 1  his valor and his skill as a soldier. When,  during King Philip's \\'ar, in 1675, the In-  dians made an attack on Agawam and nearly  destroyed the town, his house was the central  place of refuge for the beleagured inhabitants.  His sons, following the footsteps of their fa-  ther, were two noted Indian hunters, and one  of them, Pelatiah Morgan, was killed by the  Indians. In the 'records or list of ye names  of the townsmen or men of this Towne of  Springfield in February, 1664, written by Eli-  zur Holyoke,'' he appears as Serj. Miles Mor-  gan. In 1655-57, 1660-62-68 he was a select-  man. He served as constable one year, and  at different times as fence viewer, highway  surveyor, and overseer of highways, and also  on various town committees. He died May  28. 1699. A bronze statue of a Puritan sol-  dier standing in one of the public parks of  Springfield enduringly connnemorates his  fame.   He married (first) in 1643, Prudence Gil-  bert of Beverly, Massachusetts. The tradi-  tion is that on the vessel on which he came to  Boston Prudence Gilbert was also a passen-  ger, and there he made her acquaintance.  She was coming to the new world to join  mem.bers of her family already located in Bev-  erly. After he had settled in Springfield he  sent word to her and proposed marriage. She  accepted the offer, and the young man, with  two friends and an Indian guide leading pack  horses, marched across Massachusetts from  the Connecticut river to the 'land of the peo-  ple of the east,'' where the two young people  were married. After the marriage the house-  hold goods of the young couple were laden on  the packhorses, and the bride, on foot,  tramped back to Springfield, one hundred and  twenty miles, escorted by the bridegroom and  his friends. She died January 14. 1660. Is-  sue: I. Mary Morgan, born February 4,  1644; married Edmund Pryngrydays. 2.

Junius Spencer Morgan, of  whom below.   (VI) Junius Spencer, son of Joseph (,3)  and Sarah (Spencer) Morgan, was born in  West Springfield, Massachusetts. April 14.  1813. His early years were spent in Hart-  ford. Connecticut, where he was educated.  When he had giiown to manhood he went to  Boston and entered the banking house of Al-  bert Wells, where he gained his first knowl-  edge of that business in which he afterward  became successful and distinguished. In Julv.  1834, he mT5ved to New York, entering the  banking house of Morgan, Ketchum & Co.  Remaining in New York only about two     i68     SOUT?lERN NEW^ YORK     years, he returned to his native city and tliere  estabUshed himself in business as a dry-goods  merciiant in the firms of Howe, Mather &  Co. and Mather. Morjjan & Co. Subsequently  he went again to Boston and, still continuing  in the dry-goods business, became a partner  of J. M. Beebe in the famous firm of Beebe,  Morgan & Co., which in its prime was one of  the largest and most influential houses in that  trade in the United States.   Mr. Morgan visited England in 1853, and,  upon the invitation of George Peabody, be-  came associated with that great banker as  his partner in October, 1854. In ten years  he succeeded entirely to the business of Mr.  Peabody. and established the house of J. S.  Morgan & Co., which shortly became one of  the largest banking houses in the world. The  later years of his life were spent largely  abroad, but he never lost his love for his na-  tive country, and during the civil war he  gave substantial assistance to the cause of  the national gcnernment. He was a man of  generous instincts, and contributed hand-  somely to the support of educational and pub-  lic institutions. His activity as a layman in  the affairs of the Protestant Episcopal church  was noteworthy, and among other institutions,  Trinity College, of Hartford, Connecticut,  owed much to his munificence. He died in  Nice, [''ranee, in 1895. 'i^ t'l^ result of an ac-  ciflent. Me married, in Boston, in 1836, Juliet  Pierpont, daughter of Rev. John and Mary  Sheldon (Lord) Pierpont. Issue: i.

March y.  •9'3-     He was educated in the English High  school in Boston, and then studied in  the University of (iottingen, Germany, where  he completed a full course, returning to the  United States when twenty years of age. lU-  engaged in the banking business with Duncan  Sherman & Co., of New York City, in 1857,  and there obtained a full knowledge of fi-  nance in a house which at that time was one  of the most prominent in the country. In i8()o  he became American agent and attorney for  (ieorge Peabody & Co., of London, with  which house his father was connected, and in  1864 he engaged in banking on his own ac-  count in the firm of Dabney, Morgan & Co.  In 1871 he became a member of the famous  banking house of Drexel, Morgan & Co., the  name of which in 1895 ^'^'''s changed to I. P.  Morgan & Co. At the same time he was also  a member of the firm of J. S. Morgan & Co.  of London, of which his father was the foun-  der, and, upon the death of his parent, he  succeeded him in that concern. Thus he was  head of the greatest private bank in America,  and of one of the most influential monetary  institutions in England.   II is ])reeminence as a banker and financier  was recognized for nearly a quarter of a  century. In those respects he was one  :if the most potent powers that the United  States has ever known, and rivalled even  I he .--trongest men in Europe. In the wonder-  ful industrial and financial development which  characterized the closing years of the nine-  teenth century in the United States, and es-  pecially in the development of that movement  toward the consolidation of industrial enter-  prises, Mr. Morgan was not only i)roniinent,  but it is not too much to say that, at that time,  he exercised the most powerful and helpful  iniiiicnce ever displayed by any man in the  financial history of the country. Particularly  will his genius and indefatigable labors in  the organization and development of the  United States Steel Corporation be long re-  membered as a masterly achievement, and. in  the opinion of many, as laying the substantial  foundation for the great industrial prosperity  of t!u' country which followed in the years  immediately after this accom])lishiuent.   Mr. Morgan was connected with nearly  all notable financial undertakings of his time,  and his influence was always of the sound-  est character and conducive to the public wel-       j^xC-i,^^^-j/'V-^      SOUTHERN NEW YORK     169     fare as well as to the investing interests. A  list of the important reorganizations of rail-  road companies, the negotiations of loans, and  the underwriting of industrial enterprises  which have been handled by him would be  long and imposing. Also in public affairs  were his services to the country of in-  estimable value. Especially in 1894 and 1895,  and at other times of threatened monetary  stringency, he contributed substantially  and effectively to protecting the credit of the  United States treasury.   Although, when the banking disturbances  which developed in New York City in the  autumn of 1907 threatened to overwhelm the  entire country with supreme disaster, he had  been largely retired from active participation  in affairs, Mr. Morgan came forward again  to save the situation. In the grave emergency  which then arose he took the lead in measures  instituted to prevent the widespread destruc-  tion of public credit and overthrow of indus-  trial and financial institutions that was immi-  nent. His leadership in those trying days  was unreservedly accepted by men who were  foremost in the financial world in Nev York  City, and as well throughout the United  States. Among his associates he was relied  upon for initiative and for powerful influence,  and even the national administration depended  upon his advice and his assistance. After the  battle had been won and confidence restored,  it was everywhere recognized that his financial  genius and his masterly control of men and  affairs had been the main instruments in sav-  ing the country, if not the world, from the  worst disaster that had impended for a gen-  eration. The great masters of finance in Lon-  don, Paris, and other monetary centers of  Europe did not withhold their warmest praise  and indorsement of his accomplishment, while  his associates in the American fields of fi-  nance and industry have been profuse in ac-  knowledgment of the preeminent service that  he rendered to the country.   Mr. Morgan was also a large investor  in the great business enterprises of the coun-  try, and a director in more than two score  financial, railroad, and industrial corporations.  Typically foremost among the enterprises in  which he helcl important interests and exer-  cised pronounced influence in the direction of  their affairs were the followine: The United  States Steel Corporation, the Cleveland, Cin-  cinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Railway Com-     pany, the First National Bank of the City of  New York, the General Electric Company, the  Lake Erie & Western Railroad Company, the  Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Railway  Company, the Michigan Central Railroad  Company, the National Bank of Commerce of  New York, the New York & Harlem River  Railroad Company, the New York Central  and Hudson River Railroad Company, the  New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad  Company, the West Shore Railroad Company,  and the Western Union Telegraph Company.   A man of broad culture and refined tastes,  Mr. Morgan did not confine liimself to busi-  ness affairs. He was particularly inter-  ested in art, being one of its most generous  patrons, and one of the accomplished comiois-  seurs of the world. Some of the finest works  of the great masters of olden times and of  the present were owned by him. His collec-  tion of art objects is recognized as one of the  largest, most important, and most valuable  ever brought together by a single private indi-  vidual. A considerable part of this great col-  lection was acquired during the ten years or  so preceding 190S, and has been kept in Ken-  sington Museum, London, in the Metropoli-  tan Museum of Art, in New York City, and  in Mr. Morgan's private galleries in London  and New York. It consists not only of rare  and valuable paintings, but exquisite porce-  lains, marble reliefs, bronzes, enamels, fab-  rics, and other objects.   Mr. Morgan's New York residence was in  Madison avenue, and he had a country seat,  'Cragston,' at Highland Falls, New York.  He also had a house at Roehampton, near  Wimbledon, a suburb of London, and one  near Kensington. Adjoining his New York  City residence he had a fine private art gal-  lery which contains many of his art treasures.  He was a member of the leading clubs of Ne-  York City and London, was one of the foun-  ders and president of the Metropolitan Club  of New York, and was for several years com-  modore of the New York Yacht Club. Par-  ticularly interested in the Metropolitan Art  Museum, he was a generous benefactor  to that institution and w^as its president. He  arranged to erect in Hartford. Connecti-  cut, an art building in memory of his father,  to be called the Morgan Memorial ; the corner-  stone of this edifice was laid April 23, 1908.  He was one of the trustees of Columbia Uni-  versitv, a director or trustee of various other     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     educational and philanthropic institutions, a  member of the I'rotestant Episcopal Church,  and several times was a lay delegate from  the diocese of New York to the general con-  ventions of that religious body.   He married (first) Amelia, daughter of  Jonathan and Mary (Cady) Sturgess of New  York City. She died, and he married (sec-  ond) in 1S65, Frances Louise, daughter of  Charles and Louise (Kirkland) Tracy, of New  York City. Issue: i. John Pierpont Mor-  gan, born 1867; graduated from Harvard  University, class of 1889, and since then has  been engaged in the banking business with  his father. He resides in Madison avenue,  New York City, and is a member of the  Metropolitan, Union, University, Riding, New-  York Yacht, and other clubs. He married, in  1891, Jane Norton Grew, daughter of Henry  Sturgis and Jane Norton (Wigglesworth)  Grew of Boston ; she was born in Boston, Sep-  tember 30, 1868. They have one son, Junius  Spencer Morgan, born in 1892. 2. Louisa  Pierpont Morgan, married Herbert L. Satter-  lee. 3. Juliet I'ierpont Morgan, married W.  Pierson Hamilton. 4. Anne Tracy Morgan.     The family name of  \'AN DER POEL van der P'oel is the  Dutch significance  frir 'from the lake,' or mar.sh, and when  the name was first applied undoubtedly this  family dwelt beside a small body of water,  either dammed or hemmed in by natural or  artificial means, and thus, at a time in his-  tory when Christian names only were in com-  mon use, it designated which one of sev-  eral bearing the same name was meant.  The family lived originally in Gorichem  (Groningen?) on the Rhine, but dispersed  about the year 1600, the branch which then  went to Amsterdam, Holland, coming to  America not long afterwards, from whom  those of the name living here are descended.  The branch in America was originated by  Tcunis (Anthony) Cornelis van der Poel  Calias Spitsbergen), who had a short exist-  ence, for he left no male descendants so far  as is known at the present, time. He was  in Bevcrwyck (Albany) from 1660 to 1687;  married Catrina. daughter of Johannes  Cronn ; was a magistrate in 167 1, and owned  one-half of Constapel's Island in the Hud-  son river, opposite Paerde Hoeck. When     he died, about 1687 (his will was made June  17, 1687), he left a widow and three daugh-  ters, Elizabeth, Maria and Johanna. At  this time he was still the owner of a house  in Amsterdam, Holland.   (I) There is evidence of two others of  the name having been early in this country.  Jacobus (James) van der Poel married Mar-  garet Jans in New York, July 25, 1693, and  Gerrit van der Poel, a widower, married  Debora Warren, February 12, 1697.   (II) Wynant Gerritse van der Poel, son  of Gerrit van der Poel, originated this line  of descent. He was born most likely in  Holland, and was in Albany as early as  1657. He resided there until about 1694.  Pie purchased a half interest in a sawmill  located on the eastern bank of the Hudson  river, on what came to be known for the  next two centuries and more as the Wyants  kill, or creek. He bought it in 1674, from  Geertruy Pieterse Vosburgh, widow of Abra-  ham Vosburgh. His last will, made in  1695, shows that he had removed from Al-  bany, as it was indorsed 'The Will of  Wynant Gerritse van der Poel, late of Al-  bany, now of New York.' It was dated  February 29, 1695, and was probated April  17, 1702, so the date of his death must have  been in the interim. For some reason lie  bequeathed only six shillings to his son  Melgert, and gave the residue of his estate  to his son-in-law, William G. van den  Bergh. It is very possible that he provided  in the usual way for his children during his  lifetime, and in old age resided with his  daughter Catryn, who married van den  Bergh. Wjmant Gerritse van der Poel mar-  ried Tryntje Melgers. Children: i. Cor-  nelia, married Cornelis Gysbertse van den  Bergh before 1685. 2. Melgert Wynantse  (see forward). 3. Gerrit, married Catrina  Van Zandt. ,4. Catryn, married William G.  van den Bergh. before 1685. 5. Margariot.  married Johannes Van Zandt, about 1683.   (HI) Melgert W'ynant.se van der Poel.  son of Wynant Gerritse and Tryntje CMel-  gers) van der Poel, resided in .'Mbany. New  York. His house, as also his father's, fronted  on the Fort on State street, in 1675, probably  located on the south side of that principal  thorousrhfare where most of the early houses  of leading residents were built. Not infre-  quently he wrote his name Melchert. for so     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     171     it appears on some of the records. It is  likely that he died before the year 1700. Mel-  gert W'ynantse van der Poel married (first)  Ariaantje, daughter of Abraham Isaacse and  Maria ( \'igne ) \'erplanck, by whom he had  eight children, and he married (second)  Elizabeth Teller, by whom he had two chil-  dren. She was the daughter of William and  Margaret (Donchesen) Teller, Sr. By her  first husband, as shown by her will, made  February 19, 1720. she had several children,  viz.: Margaret, married Volckert Douw;  Maria, married John Vinhagen ; Magdalena,  married Abraham Lansing, and Helena.

New York,  March 4, 1705; died there April 11, 1777, but  was interred at Poelsburgh. It is thought  that he was a widower (having married on  November 8, 1736, but to whom unknown),  when he married Annatje (Nautje or An-  nie), daughter of Dr. Samuel and Catherine  (Howarden) Staats. This marriage took  place May 5, 1743, at the house on 'The  Flatts' (half way between Albany and  Troy) of Madam Schuyler, 'the American  Lady,' whose niece and adopted daughter  she was. His wife was granddaughter of  Major Abraham Staats, surgeon, who came  to Rensselaerwyck in 1642 with Dominie  Megapolensis, and whose wife was Catrina  Jochemse Wessels. Major Staats was a  prominent leader during Leisler's adminis-  tration of the government, and probably left  New York to settle in Poelsburgh soon after  its collapse. Children: i.

(VI) Isaac van der Poel, son of Johannes  and Annatje (or Annie) (Staats) van der  Poel, was born in Kinderhook, Columbia  county. New York, December 8, 1747, and  was baptized in Albany, December 25, 1747,  with Philip Schuyler and Ceertruy Lansing  as sponsors. He died in Chatham. Cohnnbia  county. New York, December 25, 1807.   He was commissioned adjutant of the  Seventh regiment (Kinderhook district),  October 20, 1775. ^•''^ was removed from  this position for disaffection to the Amer-  ican government. He afterwards joined the  British forces and commanded a company of  refugees on Staten Island. W'hile acting in  this capacity he was taken sick, and it is  said that through the influence of his mother  with her relative. General Philip Schuyler,  a pass through the American lines was se-  cured for him. She brought him to her  home, cared for him tenderly until his com-  plete recovery, and then returned him to  his company on Staten Island. His estate  was confiscated by the government, and he     1     SOUTHERX NEW YORK     was thus rendered almost penniless. He was  a man of extraordinary intellect and of a  frank, noble and generous nature, but he  never enjoyed a day of peace after the mis-  taken step he took in the Revolution. Fol-  lowing his marriage, he purchased a small  farm in the village of Chatham, over the hill  and about a mile and a half from Kinderhook  lake, where he passed the remainder of his  days quietly and not far removed from the  wide circles of his relatives and boyhood days.  Isaac van der Poel married Moyca  (Mayke, or May), daughter of Jacobus  (James), of Pompaonie, and Elizabeth (Van  Dyck) Huyck. She was born October 17,  1758, died in Stuyvesant, New York, No-  vember 20, 1827, and was interred in the  Kinderhook, New York, cemetery. Her  mother was the daughter of Arent and Heyl-  tie ( Van Alen ) Van Dyck, who had, be-  side Moyca, children named Arent and Bur-  ger. Arent Van Dyck, maternal grand-  father of Isaac van der Poel, was one of  His Majesty's justices of the peace for the  colony. He was a gentleman of education  and talents, and the general scribe for the  region in which he lived. He was a lineal  descendant of Hendrick Van Dyck, who was  attorney-general of the Dutch province of  New York, and who came from the West  Indies with Go\ernor Peter Stuyvesant. He  and Stuyvesant were two obstinate Dutch-  men, and seemed to have quarreled all the  way from the West Indies until they ar-  rived at New York. Children: i.

He resided in the  place of his nativity throughout his life,  where he had an extensive practice as a  physician of repute. He died there Octo-  ber 2/, 1851, and was buried in the Kinder-  hook cemetery amid the graves of his an-  cestors of two centuries.   Dr. John \'an der Poel married at Coshen.

Burnett.   (VIII) Dr. Samuel Oakley Van der Poel,  son of Dr. John and Sarah W. ( Oakley ) \'an  der Poel, was born in Kinderhook, Colum-  bia county, New York, February 22, 1824,  and died at Washington, D. C, March 12,  1886.   Like his father, he was a physician 01  celebrity, and as health officer of the port  of New York for a great many years gained  wide prominence. His boyhood and youth  were spent in his native place, and the out-  door life of that healthful locality helped  him to develop a vigorous and robust con-  stitution. He completed his preparatory  training at an early age in the Kinderhook  Academy and then entered upon his col-  legiate course in the University of New  York, of which institution the venerable and  scholarly Theodore Frelinghuysen was then  the chancellor. Receiving his diploma, he  returned to begin the study of medicine with  his father, and after a thorough course at  home and in the institution, graduated at  JefTerson Medical College, Philadelphia, in  the spring of 1845. FoJ' the next two years  he was associated in practice with his  father; but he still regarded his education  and early .practice as only preparatory to  the real professional career he had marked  out, so in the fall of 1847 he went to Paris  to pursue his studies with the superior ad-  \antages belongine to that brilliant capital.  It was a remarkable period, when Dr. Van  der Poel began his serious post-graduate  course in medicine. Paris was in the midst  of profound agitation. The unpopular min-  istry of Guizot and the trembling throne of  the citizen king were tottering to their fall.  This political ferment culminated in the  violent revolution of February, 1848, ending  in the abdication of Louis Phillipe and the  proclamation of the Second Republic. He  was a witness of these memorable and tur-  bulent scenes, and, as the seething tumult  was unpropitious to the calm prosecution of  studies, he traveled through the south of  France and Italy, witnessing at Lyons, Mar-  seilles, Naples, Rome. Florence and Milan  the various acts of the revolutionary drama  then exciting all Europe. Immediately after  the bloody days of June he returned to the     French capital and remained for a consider-  able period.   In the spring of 1850, Dr. Van der Poel  came to Albany, New York, where he settled  and speedily acquired a remunerative prac-  tice which continued to he both flattering and  progressive, and it was in this year that he  married there. In 1857, Governor John Alsop  King appointed him surgeon-general of New  York state, and three years later he was chos-  en president of the Albany County Medical  Society, being re-elected the following year as  an endorsement of his wise administration In  1 86 1 he was again invited to hold the office  of surgeon-general, this time by Governor Ed-  win D. Morgan. The position proved in this  case not one of mere empty honor or a sine-  cure. The inauguration of the civil war  shortly after his term began, imposed duties  and responsibilities far more arduous, delicate  and important than had ever before devolved  upon that or any other similar position in this  country. It became necessary, without the  guide of precedent or experience, to impro-  vise a vast and systematic bureau meeting ev-  ery requirement attaching to the complete  medical organization of a great force. There  were many militia regiments to be promptly  provided with medical supplies and instru-  ments as they hurried to the field. There were  numerous volunteer regiments rapidly assem-  bling, requiring immediate care for their sick  and attention to their permanent organization.  There were hundreds of surgeons and assist-  ants coming from every section of the state,  representing every grade of the profession,  whose qualifications were to be examined and  decided. New regiments were uninterrupted-  ly organized, and old regiments demanded  constant attention, even after they had passed  into the service of the United States, in order  that a competent medical staff might be main-  tained. This last duty was made ]3articularly  harassing and exhausting by the crude system  of the general government during the first two  years of the war. In many cases the medical  officers no sooner became conversant with  their duties than the novelty and romance  vanished, their resignations were offered and  accepted, and the surgeon-general required to  fill the vacancies with such promptitude that  the public service should suffer no detriment.  The magnitude of the responsibility and the  severity of the labor thus imposed may be     1/4   judged from the fact that there were between  six and seven hundred positions upon the  medical staff to be kept filled with competent  officers. A still more significant testimony is  embodied in the statement that at one time  the surgeon-general was called upon to make  over five hundred appointments in the space  of six weeks. Nor was this all. He was  obliged to establish and perfect a system of  ])romotion which should be just, without fa-  voritism, and confer reward without impairing  the efficiency of the service. His patronage  was immense. With hundreds of officers in  this department, upon whose respective mer-  its none but himself could decide, it required  a nice sense of honor and a wise discrimina-  tion to distribute the appointments in such a  wav that the good of the general service might  be harmonized with a recognition of just per-  sonal claims. Nothing could put the profes-  sional acquirements and the executive talents  of a man to a severer test than these varied,  complicated and difficult duties ; and it is but  to repeat the judgment of the highest authori-  ties to say that they were performed by Dr.  Van der Pocl with signal ability. His suc-  cessful administration elicited the official ap-  proval of both the Secretary of War and the  the governor of the state of New York, and  constitutes an important chapter in the asso-  ciation of New York with the great contest.   In 1867, Dr. Van der Poel was appointed  to the chair of General Pathology and Clinical  Medicine in the Albany Medical College,  which position he held for three years  and then resigned. About the same time  he was appointed a manager of the .State  Lunatic .Asylum at Utica, New York, a  position in which he did effective work.  In February, 1870, he was elected pres-  ident of the Medical Society of the State  of New York, the highest recognition in the  power of his professional brethren. The next  step in his noteworthy career was equally if  not more important, as affecting innumerable  persons. In 1872. Governor John T. Hoffman  placed him in charge of the quarantine de-  partment of the port of New York as health  officer. The irregularities of this office for  many years hafl been the theme of discussion  in legislative councils and commercial con-  ventions, for nothing in the way of a reform  seemed to have been at all effective. The  antagonism of commerce and quarantine were     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     developed to the fullest extent. In this field,  with all its complications, there was full scope  for the exertion of his remarkable executive  ability, which he had previously displayed. In  many respects this is the highest medical of-  fice in the world, and to Dr. Van der Poel  belongs the credit of restoring it to its true  position. His first action was to reduce the  various parts of it to form one perfect sys-  tem. The enormous expenditures had grown  into a heterogeneous organization without  much system. Taking charge of it purely as  a sanitary interest, he placed in the hands of  those who owned merchandise and ships the  work which had to be done on their vessels,  and which thus could be done by them under  the ordinary business rules that controlled  such matters elsewhere. The quarantine law,  which had grown by successive enactments in-  to an authority for oppressive administration,  was codified and relaxed from some of its pro-  visions, only retaining what was necessary of  sanitary restraint for the public safety, and  these changes were urged forcefully upon the  legislature. For the first time in the history  of quarantine, one found that commerce was  actively sustaining it. Mercantile associations  passed complimentary and approving resolu-  tions, and petitioned the legislature in favor of  every change which he recommended.  Branches of trade which had -left New  York apparently forever, to avoid the  expenses incident to their quarantine de-  tention, began soon thereafter to re-  turn. In all this acute change of con-  ditions, there was not the slightest relaxa-  tion of sanitary restraint necessary to the pro-  tection of the entire northern frontier and  Western United States, which depend upon  this port for their immigrations ; but sanitary  retrulations. which Dr. Van der Poel consid-  ered as his legitimate care, were made more  strict than ever before. In January, 1876, he  was elected to the chair of Theory and Prac-  tice of Medicine in the Albany Medical Col-  lege, a position which he sustained with credit  to that institution's advancement. It is of  common repute that as a physician he was  equally learned in theory as skilled in prac-  tice. To large native endowments he added  the highest cultivation. He delighted in the  acquisition of an enormous medical library.  which he enriched with rare and important  foreign works. He was known to his friends     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     175     1 1 as a gentleman of large, public spirit and pos-  ■ ■ sessing an attractive quality of broad, genial  culture.   Dr. Samuel Oakley Van der Poel married,  at Albany, New York, December 10, 1850,  ( Icrtrude Lansing Wendell, who was born in  Albany, January 15, 1824, died in Cazenovia,  1! New York, August 13, 1906, daughter of Dr.  ! Peter Wendell and Elizabeth Van Kleeck.  It is desirable to include here a few facts  regarding the parentage of Mrs. S. O. Van  der Poel. Dr. Peter Wendell was a man of  prominence in Albany. He was born there  Tunc 3, 1786, died at his residence on Elk-  street, in that city, October 29, 1849. ^^ was  the son of Jacob Harmanus Wendell (born  October 21, 1754, died March 23, 1826, son  of Harmanus Wendell and Catherine Van  Vechten), who married, about 1785, Geertruy  (Gertrude) Lansing (born September 3, 1758,  daughter of Peter Lansing and Elizabeth  \\'endell). His wife (Elizabeth Van Kleeck)  (lied in Albany, November 11, 1846. He stud-  ied medicine with Dr. William McLellan of  Albany ; attended lectures at the University  of Pennsylvania; commenced practice in 1807  at Albany ; received the degree of M. D. from  his ahna mater in 1823, at which time he was  elected a Regent of the University of the State  of New York, of which body he became chan-  cellor in 1842, filling that office until his death.  The children of Dr. S. O. Van der Poel and  Gertrude Lansing Wendell, all born in Al-  bany, New York, were: i. Wendell, born Oc-  tober 23, 1851, died August 9, 1852. 2. Sam-  uel Oakley, born August 27, 1853; married,  October 20, 1880, Mary Louisa Halsted ; died  in New York City, April 22, 1912 (see for-  ward). 3. Herman Wendell, born July 8,  1856, died March 16, 1906, in Boston, Massa-  chusetts. 4. John, born February 20, 1858  (see forward). 5. Elizabeth Wendell, born  March 17, 1861, died September 3, 1861. 6.  Lewis Morris, born June 20, 1862, died Au-  gust 4, 1863. 7. Gertrude Wendell, born No-  vember 2, 1864; married, in New York City,  October 20, 1892, Anson Blake Moran, broker,  who was born in Brooklyn, New York, May  2, 1865, son of Daniel Edward and Annie  Augtista (Blake) Moran; by whom: Gertrude  Van der P'oel Moran, born in New York City,  September 13,. 1894, died in Cazenovia, New  York, September i, 1912; and Annette Blake     Moran, born in New York City, March 13,  1899. .   (IX) Dr. Samuel Oakley Yan der Poel, son  of Dr. Samuel Oakley and Gertrude Lansing  (Wendell) Van der Poel, was born in Albany,  New York, August 27, 1853, and died at his  home, No. 63 East Fifty-fifth street, New  York City, April 22, 1912.   He completed his education, after prelimi-  nary studies in his native city, at Rutgers Col-  lege, graduating with the class of 1873. He  received the degree of Master of Arts the  following year, and acquired his degree of  M. D. at the College of Physicians and Sur-  geons, Columbia University, in 1876. He  served eighteen months as house physician in  Bellevue Hospital, and then took a post-gradu-  ate course in Vienna. Upon his return to the  United States he began practice in Albany,  where he was appointed adjunct professor of  theory and practice in the Albany Medical  College, and received an honorary M. D. de-  gree there. In 1885 he removed to New York  City, and was appointed visiting physician at  Randall's Island, as also at the Charity Hos-  pital. At about the same time he became as-  sistant surgeon at the Manhattan Eye and Ear  Infirmary and the throat department of the  Vanderbilt Clinic. In 1888 he was made sen-  ior medical director of the New York Life  Insurance Company, a position he held with  more than satisfactory credit until the time of  his death. The end came as a great shock to  his associates of that institution and his many  friends, for only the previous day he had  gone on a trip into the country and was feel-  ing in excellent health. He was a Republican,  and attended the church of Rev. John Park-  hurst. He belonged to the University, Cen-  tury and Rockaway Hunt clubs, and to the St.  Nicholas and Holland societies. The follow-  ing minute regarding the death of Dr. Van der  Poel was passed by the office committee of the  New York Life Insurance Company, May i,  1912, and only serves to illustrate in slight  measure in what esteem he was held gener-  ally:   'We record the death, on the 22nd of .\pril, 1912,  of our associate. Dr. S. Oakley Van der Poel. The  deceased was a distinguished physician, a useful citi-  zen, a model husband and father, a devoted servant  of this institution, and a loyal friend. He was effi-  cient and faithful in all the onerous duties laid upon  him during- his nearly twenty years of service here,  and his labors have passed into and become a part     176     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     of the practice and history of this company. We  testify to his eminent quaUties, and offer our deep-  est sympathies to his widow and sons.'   Dr S. O.

He served as house sur-  geon in the New York Hospital for eighteen  months, as house physician in the Mount  Sinai Hospital for six months, and followed  up his post-graduate studies during the next  two years at the Universities of Berlin, Leipsic  and Vienna, during w^hich time he served as  interne at the Dresden Lying-in Hospital for  four months. Upon his return to America he  practiced in New York City, and associated  himself with the New York University Medi-  cal College, from which he received the ap-  pointment of lecturer on obstetrics in 1888.  In 1896 he w-as appointed clinical lecturer in  genito-urinary diseases at the same institution.  which position he held for fourteen years, and  during the last four years of this period served  as assistant attending surgeon at Bellevue     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     177     Hospital in this department. He is a member  of the University, Century, New York Yacht,  Riding, and Piping Rock clubs, as also the  New York State Medical Society, New York  County Medical Society, New York Academy  of Medicine, American Association of Genito-  urinary Surgeons, of which he was president  in 1910: American Urological Association, and  the 'Association Internationale d'Urologie,'  of which he is at present American secretary.

He was born in Kinderhook,  Columbia county. New York, February 5,  lyqg, and died in New York City, July 18,  1870.   In 181 1 he went to live with his older broth-  er. Judge James Van der Poel, in the same  village, and there began his classical studies,  continuing them under Levi Gleason, a cele-  brated teacher in his day. He took up the  study of law in 1816 in his brother's office,  and was admitted to the bar in 1820, at the  time of his coming of age. Thereupon he  formed a professional connection with his  brother, the firm of young and energetic law-  yers meeting with success. He took consid-  erable interest in politics, and was active as a  Democrat. In 1824 he was elected to the  assembly, and again in 1828 and 1829. John  Van Buren was at this time a student in his  ofifice, and later married his niece. In 1832 he  was elected to the twenty-third session of  congress, and received endorsement of his ef-  forts by re-election to the twenty-fourth and  twenty-sixth, the years being 1832. 1834 and  1838 that he served in Washington. This was  during a period of unexampled interest and  excitement, throughout which he was a firm  supporter of the administration, having the  full confidence of Presidents Andrew Jackson  and Martin Van Buren, for of both of whom  he was a warm personal as well as political  friend, the latter president coming from his  home town, Kinderhook. This can be verified  more fully by reference to the files of the con-  gressional debates. After his third congres-  sional term he resumed the practice of law in  New York, where his ability won for him high  honor at the bar and great respect amongst     his confreres. He was appointed a justice of  the superior court of New York City in 1843,  was re-elected in 1847, 'i'''^ served until Janu-  ary I, 1850, in all for seven years. The first  and second volumes of Sandford's Sup<Tior  Court Reports contain many of his fipii ions  and judgments.   He was a member of the Dutch Refoimed  church, as had been his ancestors for genera-  tions back to the time of their coming ta this  country ; but later was a member of St.  George's Episcopal Church in New York City.  He traveled abroad, following his marriage,  and on returning built his home at No. 114  East Sixteenth street.   Judge Aaron Van der Poel married (first)  September 3, 1821, Harriet Baldwin, who died  in April, 1837, without issue. He married  (second), April 2, 1839, Ellen McBride, who  was born in New York City, August 14, 18 15,  and died there December 26, 1891. She was  the daughter of James McBride and Hannah  Savage, the latter born in Spencertown, New  York. Children, born in New York City: i.  James McBride, born August 2, 1840, died  there, December 27, i860. 2. John A., born  August 22, 1842, died there, April 12, 1866  (see forward). 3. Aaron Ernest, born Feb-  ruary 20, 1846, died there, September 26,  i8q8.   (VIII) John A. Van der Poel. .son of Judge  Aaron and Ellen (McBride) Van der Poel,  was born in New York City, August 22, 1842,  and died there, April 12, 1866.   .•\lthough baptized 'John', he wrote his  name 'John A.', in order to be distinguished  from his cousin, bearing also simply the name  of John, which was but the natural old-fash-  ioned form of including the father's name to  show whose son he was. It is unfortunate  that his life was a short one, for by inheri-  tance of intellectual power and his splendid  education he was at the open door of a life  full of promise. He received his early train-  ing in the home of his parents and at the  Charlier School in New York City, which at  that time was famous as a private school and  where many who later gained prominence in  the metropolis acquired their preparatory edu-  cation. He then went to the Chateau de Lan-  cey, in Switzerland; followed that course with  attendance at Columbia University, graduated  there, then graduated at the Columbia Law  School and was acquiring the practice of law     1     >/-«     SOUTHERN NE\\' YORK     in the office of his cousin, Aaron J. Van der  Poel, at the time of his death. He was an  Episcopahan. and throughout liis hte resided  in New York City.   fohn A. Van der Poel married, in New  York City, May 22. 1865. Emily Caroline  Noyes. She was horn in New York City. June  zi. 1842. and in 1913 was residing at No. 22  Cramercy Park, with summer residence at  Litchfield, Connecticut. She is the daughter  of William Curtis Noyes and Julia Flewwel-  ling Tallmadge. She is a member of and  much interested in the work of the Colonial  Dames of America, of the Connecticut Daugh-  ters of the American Revolution, and of the  National Arts Society, being on the board of  the latter organization. She studied art with  R. Swain Gifford and William Sartain, and  has written 'Color Problems', and 'The  Chronicles of a Pioneer School'. (This im-  mediate line of the family use the name form  of Vanderpoel).   William Curtis Noyes was the son of  George Noyes and Martha Curtis. He was  born at Schodack. New York, August 19.  1805. and died in New York City, December  25, 1864. His line of descent traces through  his father, George Noyes, son of William  Noves and Elizabeth Gillct, who was the son  of William Noyes and Sybil Whiting (through  the latter to \\'illiam Pyncheon. John Alden,  Governor William Bradford and others of  the earliest New England families) ; who was  the son of John Noyes and Mary Gallup; who  was the son of Rev, James Noyes, one of the  founders of Yale College, and Dorothy Stan-  ton : who was the son of Rev. James Noyes  and Sarah Brown, the last paternal ancestor  named having been born in Choulderton, Wilt-  shire, England, came to America in 1634, and  settled in Newbury, Massachusetts.   Mr. Noyes was one of the most successful  lawyers of his times in New York City, and  maintained prominence among professional  and i)hiIantliroi)ic circles of the metropolis.  He was a Republican, and active in the work  of the Union League Club. He was of Pres-  byterian faith, and was a trustee of the Uni-  versity and Tenth Street Church, as well as  one of the founders of the Church of the  Coven.ant. both of New York City. Among  other interests, he was first vice-president of  the New York Law Institute; council of the  University of the City of New York for many     years; counsellor of the New York. New Ha-  ven & Hartford railroad, also of the Pacific  Mutual Insurance Company, and a member of  the Century and Athenaeum clubs.   His career began at the age of fourteen  years with the study of law, and when twenty-  two he was practicing in Rome, New York,  continuing at Utica, and finally removing to  the metropolis in 1838, where it was not long  ere he became eminent among practitioners.  His life was devoted to his profession. His  management of the North American Trust  cases ; his able exposition of the laws of  'Charitable Uses' in the Rose will case, and  his remarkable contest in what is known as  the 'Omnibus Suit' of the New York & New  Haven Railroad against Schuyler atid others,  were some of his {)romincnt cases. In the lat-  ter, said the Hon. William M. Evarts at the  meeting of the bar. 'speaking literally, Mr.  Noyes was on one side and all the rest of us  (the bar) on the other.'   In the proceedings had before the New York  Court of Appeals in memory of Mr. Noyes.  as reported in Volume 32 of the New York  Reports, page 10, the following tribute was  paid to him :   'His experience was various and extensive: his  knowledge of the law and of its history exact and  comprehensive; his apprehension of legal distinc-  tions clear and precise, and he was thoroughly fur-  nished for every trial of strength in those conflicts  of the bar upon which the administration of justice  most intimately depends. His public life was  marked by integrity of character, firmness of pur-  pose and adherence to principle. In his social  walk, virtue and benevolence shed their radiance  upon his way. * * * \Vc entertain great satisfac-  tion and pride in the memory of his wonderful at-  tainments as a legal scholar and thorough lawyer,  the laborious hours he gave voluntarily in the serv-  ice of the State in the discharge of his duty as a  Commissioner of the Code, the munificent spirit ex-  hibited in the complete and splendid libran,- he col-  lected and freely opened to his brethren, the masterly  skill and ability witb which he performed his part  in the profcs,sion he adorned, and the lustre which  he shed as a lawyer upon the Rar of New York.  We recognize among the traits which ennobled his  character his inflexible principle and rectitude of  purpose, his truth as a man and his severity of  conscience, all tempered by courtesy and illumined  by the light of Christianity.'   He had a decided taste for general litera-  ture, and collected a large library of law and  miscellaneous books. The former he gave to  Hamilton College, which had honored him  with an LL.D. Descended from Puritan an-     ^^. .      (ijUJ. UQ, UYcLAy^     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     179     cestry, Mr. Noyes inherited many of their  virtues, was a consistent Presbyterian, and  practiced his beHef. He was charitable as a  habit, giving liberally to good objects and sup-  porting a home missionary for years. He was  on the charity board of the New England  Society, of which he was made president just  before his last illness.   As his father had been a member of the so-  called underground railroad, he imbibed as a  boy an intense love of freedom. He served  as a member of the Peace Commission which  sat in Washington in 1861, and made efforts  to avert civil war. When these were unsuc-  cessful, he unstintedly gave time and money  to support the government. He was early a  member of the Union League Club. In 1857  the legislature of New York appointed him,  with Alexander Bradford and David Dudley  Field, commissioners to prepare a civil code,  Mr. Noyes taking the main charge of the  Penal Code, which was about finished at the  time of his death.   William Curtis Noyes married (first) Anne  Tracy, of Utica, New York. He married  (second), at New York City, October 7, 1841,  Julia Flewwelling Tallmadge, who was born  in New York City, July 5, 1818, and died there  March 9, 1899. She was the daughter of  Frederick Augustus Tallmadge and Elizabeth  Hannah Canfield, -of Sharon, Connecticut.  The latter was the daughter of Judge Judson  Canfield and Mabel Ruggles. Frederick A.  Tallmadge was the son of Colonel Benjamin  Tallmadge, head of the secret service under  General Washington, and Mary Floyd, daugh-  ter of William Floyd. Signer of the Declara-  tion of Independence: who was the son of  Rev. Benjamin Tallmadge and Susanna Smith,  ('f Long Island: who was the son of James  Tallmadge and Hannah Harrison; son of John  Tallmadge and Abigail Bishop ; son of Robert  Tallmadge and Sarah Nash, the last-named  paternal ancestor having come to America in  164,^. from Newton .Stacy.

William  Tracy, born in 1848, died when fourteen  months old. 3. Mary Tallmadge, born in 1852,  died in New York City, in 1856.   (IX) John Arent Van der Poel, son of John  A. and Emily Caroline (Noyes) Van der Poel,  was born in New York City, June 4, 1866,  and died in Boston, Massachusetts, January  18, 1902. He received his early education in  New York, followed by a special course at  Rutgers College, New Brunswick, New Jer-  sey. He resided in New York and Boston, in  the former place joining the National Guard  of New York State and becoming first lieuten-  ant of the Twelfth Regiment. Passing his  summers in Litchfield, Connecticut, in the  home of his maternal grandmother, Mrs. Wil-  liam Curtis Noyes, he built there in her honor,  in 1900, the Noyes Memorial Building, a fire-  proof structure, which houses a public library,  an historical society, and a scientific associa-  tion.   John A. Van der Poel married, at Wash-  ington, D. C, January 11, 1888, Elizabeth  Crichton Battelle, who was born May 28, 1862,  dau.ghter of Cornelius Battelle, of Sau.gerties,  New York. Issue : Floyd Lewis, born at  Saugerties, New York, October 16, 1892.   (X) Floyd Lewis Van der Poel, son of  John Arent and Elizabeth Crichton (Battelle)  Van der Poel, was born at Saugerties, New  York, October 16, 1892. He first attended  school in England, the Choate School, in Wal-  lingford, Connecticut, and is now engaged in  electric manufacturing in Bantam. Connecti-     Major George Washington Rains,  RAINS an American soldier and chemist,  was born in Craven county, North  Carolina, in 1817, eighth child of Gabriel and  Esther Rains. His early education was re-  ceived at the Newbern Academy, in Craven  county, and at an early age he went out to the  Indian Territory, then a primitive wilderness  inhabited only by savages, to join his broth-  er. Lieutenant Gabriel J. Rains, at that time  disbursing agent of the LTnited States in that  district. Here he remained more than a year,  and in returning to Alabama made a voyage  of six hundred miles, in a dug-out, down the  Arkansas river, from Fort Gibson to Little     i8o     SOUTIIERX NEW YORK     Rock. Ill 1838 he entered West Point Acad-  emy, and having a strong taste for mihtary  life went through the different grades from  corporal to first captain of cadets, with the  highest credit. Me was first in scientific  studies, and in summation of the whole ranked  third in his class. He graduated in 1842. and  having received his commission July ist of that  year, as second lieutenant of engineers, he left  West Point for Boston, where, serving under  Colonel Thayer, he was engaged in the con-  struction of Fort Warren, and it was here that  Lieutenant Rains gained his practical experi-  ence in engineering. Having, however, a pre-  dilection for the parade and excitement of  military life, the quiet and monotony of the  engineer corps hecame irksome to him. and  after a year's experience under Colonel Thay-  er he resolved to apply for an exchange. Gen-  eral Scott, who took a great interest in the  cadets and often visited West Point, had seen  and become acquainted with young Rains, and  used his influence to obtain what had never  been heard of in the army before, the wished-  for exchange from a higher to a lower grade.  Joining the Fourth .Artillery at Fortress Mon-  roe, he reported to General Walbach then in  command, a perfect soldier and the beau ideal  of a bluff old officer. He remained with that  regiment only about a year, when an assistant  professor being required at West Point, Lieu-  tenant Rains, by reason of his brilliant scien-  tific record while at the Acadamy, was chosen  to fill the position. Returning then to West  Point in 1844, as one of the assistant profess-  ors of chemistry, geology and mineralogv. he  remained there until the outbreak of the Mex-  ican war in 1846, when he applied to join his  regiment, and embarked with it for Point  Isabel, at the mouth of the Rio Grande, then  the great depot of the army of Mexico. While  stationed at Point Isabel in 1846. he was made  acting assistant quartermaster and acting com-  missary of subsistence, but tiring of the inac-  tion r)f depot life he wrote to General Scott  that he had left a fine position at West Point  solely that he might be engaged in actual serv-  ice, and begged the general to use his influ-  ence to that end. In the meantime General  Taylor had detailed him as bearer of dis-  patches to the fleet at \'era Cruz. Quite un-  expectedly General Scott with his staff arrived  at the mouth of the Rio Grande, and sending  for him told him that he was going to relieve     him and take him into the field, and that he  should supersede those of General Taylor.  Accordingly, in January, 1847, '^^ sailed for  Vera Cruz, and was the first American officer  who entered that city. \\'hen he returned  General Scott verbally appointed him his aide-  de-camp, but (ieneral Pillow having applied  for him. General Scott decided he must accept  the latter appointment, and he remained on  (ieneral Pillow's staff' during the campaign,  that commenced with the seige of Vera Cruz,  and until the battle of Cerro Gordo when Gen-  eral Pillow was wounded and returned inval-  ided to the United States. He then became  aide to General Scott during (General Pillow's  absence, and was with him during the march  to and occupation of Puebla.   On General Pillow's return. Lieutenant  Rains rejoined him as aide-de-camp and par-  ticipated in all the battles of the valley, receiv-  ing his commission as first lieutenant of the  Fourth Artillery in March, 1847, and as brevet  captain for gallant conduct at the battle of  Contreras and Cherubusco, on the 20th of  .Xugust of the same year. For gallant conduct  at the battle of Chapultepec, Captain Rains  received his commission as brevet major, and  after seven months' residence in Mexico re-  turned with General Pillow to New Orleans.  As the summer advanced they were ordered  to Pascagoula, and after some weeks there  were sent to Florida, the Indians having com-  menced hostilities. His duties here consisted  in making roads, constructing bridges and  building forts, the Indians keeping concealed  in the hammocks after their arrival and never  appearing in the open field, so that no en-  gagement took place. He remained for about  eighteen months in the lower part of Florida,  and in the neighborhood of the Everglades,  when a treaty was made between General  Twiggs and Bowlegs, King of the Seminoles.  In 1830 he was ordered to Fort Hamilton,  where he stayed only a year, and after this,  with but short assignments of duty at each  post he was ordered in succession to Forts  Columbus and Mackinaw, back a.gain to Bos-  ton Harbor, and then once more to Fort Co-  lumbus. In i8,S5 he was made commandant  of recruits at Governor's Island, and it was  while holding this position that he was mar-  ried to Frances Josephine Ramsdell. .Xjiril 2,^.  1856. In October of this year he resigned  from the army and went to Newburg to live.     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     where he became president and part owner of  the Washington Iron Works in that city.   In 1861, being a son of the south, he re-  ported for duty to Mr. Jefferson Davis, who,  knowing his scientific attainments and being  urgently in need of an officer to take charge  of the manufacture of ammunition, persuaded  liim to accept that position. He was accord-  ingly placed at once on special duty in the  ordnance department and commissioned July  10, 1 861. Gunpowder was most urgently  needed. Carte blanche was given him as to  choice of location, and nature of plant neces-  sary for its manufacture, and the result was  eminently satisfactory. By various energetic  measures the troops were temporarily sup-  plied, pending the erection of the Confederate  Powder Works, and this in the face of almost  insurmountable difficulties, with but primitive  appliances many of them improvised for tlie  occasion, and everything to be commenced de  novo. In seven short months was erected, suf-  ficiently for operation, at Augusta, Georgia,  the largest and most complete powder manu-  factory ever seen on this continent at that  time.   Colonel Rains had also charge of the arsenal  at Augusta, Georgia, from which small arms  and ammunition were turned out in great  quantities, as well as the foundry and ma-  chine shop, from which twelve-pound Na-  poleon guns were made, and shells, hand-  grenades and torpedoes in large quantities.  Nothing could have better illustrated the com-  bination of great scientific knowledge with  marvelous ingenuity in the overcoming of me-  chanical difficulties. In 1865 he was promoted  to tiie rank of brigadier-general. After the  termination of the war, in November, 1866,  he became professor of chemistry in tlie med-  ical department of the University of Georgia,  and from it he received the degree of M.D.,  March i, 1867. The university conferred  upon him the degree of LL.D., June 13, 1880.  He was dean of the Medical College until  1884, when he resigned that position, but re-  mained a member of the faculty until March,  1894, when he retired from active life, and  upon his resignation he was made a professor  emeritus. While living in Augusta he thor-  oughly identified himself with the interests of  that city and took an active part in all things  pertaining to her welfare.   He largely contributed to scientific litera-     ture, his contributions being scattered through  various periodicals. Among his notable pub-  lications are: 'Steam Portable Engines'  (i860); 'Rudimentary Course of Analytical  and Applied Chemistry' (1872); 'Chemical  Qualitative Analysis' (1879) ; and 'A History  of the Confederate Powder Works' (1882).  He was a born instructor of youth, having a  clear perception of what he taught, and a  magic way of imparting knowledge to others.   General Rains possessed remarkable origi-  nality of mind with great perceptive and in-  ventive powers : an omnivorous reader, he kept  well abreast of the times in all departments  of scientific knowledge, and in his bold, phil-  osophic deductions from the most recent sci-  entific discoveries was far in advance of his  time. Modest and simple, it seemed almost  strange that so much gentleness and simplicity  of manner could be associated with so much  ability in so many directions and with such  great practical energy. With a mind of the  highest culture, polished manners and fasci-  nating address, he was a great favorite in the  social circle, where his high sense of honor,  sound practical sense, generous nature and  sterling worth endeared him to a host of warm  personal friends.   He married, April 23, 1856, Frances J.,  daughter of Homer Ramsdell, of Newburg,  New York (see Ramsdell VHI). Major Rains  died at Newburg, March 21, 1898.   (The Ramsdell Line.)  It is difificult to determine to what extent the  descendants of the pioneers of New England  are indebted to the political condition that ob-  tained in the mother country during the period  of the settlement of the colonies now constitut-  ing the New England states. There is no  doubt that the intolerant attitude of the Brit-  ish government toward the Puritans drove to  these shores a class of settlers far superior to  what might, and probably would have come  hither, if they had not been oppressed at  home. The intolerance of the Puritans in  New England drove those of the Baptist faith  and the Quakers to settle in remote localities,  so that records on the early generations of  this family have been difificult to obtain. The  ancestor of the Ramsdells, a sturdy character,  came to Massachusetts in the first century of  colonization. His descendants are not numer-  ous, but they have numbered among them     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     many good men and some leaders. They have  taken part in tlie great events that have oc-  curred in more than two centuries. They were  patriots in the revolution and furnished their  full quota of fighting men. One of the name  fell at the battle of Lexington at the very  outset of the rexolution. From Massachusetts  the familv has spread into many states, where  the position of its members is a very honorable  one.   (I) Joseph Ramsdell, or as it was often  spelled on the old records Ramsden, was born  in England, probably about 1620, and was an  early settler in Plymouth. His name first ap-  pears on the records of Plymouth as owner  of land planted on shares in 1641, and was  on the list of Plymouth men able to bear arms  in 1O43. He married (first) March, 1645,  Rachel Eaton, born 1625, daughter of Francis  Eaton. He married (second) October 16,  1661, Mary Savory. The only child named on  the records and the only one known to gene-  alogists is Daniel, mentioned below.   (Hj Daniel, only child known of Joseph  Ramsdell, was born September 14, 1649, at  Plymouth, Massachusetts. His name appears  on the Plymouth records again in 1665. His  wife bore the name of Sarah. The children  of Daniel Ramsdell, so far as known, were:  Thomas, mentioned below ; Samuel, born  1689-90; Joseph, 1693; Benjamin, 1699; Han-  nah, 1700.   (HI ) Thomas, son of Daniel Ramsdell, was  born about 1680 in the Plymouth colony. He  and his brother Samuel settled in Scituate, in  that part that was set off as Hanover, in 171 1  or 1712. The records of Scituate show that  Thomas Ramsdell married, March 23, 1703,  Sarah, whose surname is not given. She was  born about 1682, died in Hanover, in 1773. at  the advanced age of ninety-one years. Pie  died at Hanover, September 16, 1727, a com-  l)aratively young man. He resided from 1706  to 1 710 in Pembroke, Massachusetts, where  the births of three children are recorded,  namely: Mary, May 9, 1706; Joseph, men-  tioned below; Jeremiah, July 28, 1710. The  children of Thomas and Sarah Ramsdell re-  corded at Hanover were: Gideon, born Sep-  tember 13, 1712; Sarah, July 12. 1715; Mercy,  November 5, 1717, married. March 9, 1738.

(VI) Joseph (4), eldest son of Joseph (3)  and Elizabeth (Barker) Ramsdell, was born  September 10, 1775, in Hanover, Massachu-  setts, settled in Warren about 1800, where he  died August 5, 181 7. He married, in Han-  over, February 3, 1800, Ruth Stockbridge,  born November 8, 1777, recorded in Warren,  daughter of William and Ruth ( Bailey )  Stockbridge, of Hanover, a descendant of John  Stockbridge, who was among the passengers  on the ship ''Blessing,' which came from Eng-  land to Massachusetts in 1635. His son,  Charles Stockbridge, born in England in 1634  was a wheelwright, resided in Boston, and  died in 1683 in Scituate, Massachusetts. His  wife, Abigail, afterward married Amos Tur-  ner. Her son, Joseph Stockbridge, born June  28, 1672, died 1773, married Mary Turner.  David, son of Joseph and Mary Stockbridge,  born 1713, in Hanover, died 1788, married  (second) Jane Reed, and they were the par-  ents of William Stockbridge, born December  20, 1752, died 1831. He married, October 9,  1774. Ruth, daughter of John Bailey, and they  were the parents of Ruth Stockbridge, who  became the wife of Joseph (4) Ramsdell.  Their children recorded in Hanover were :  Joseph, born October 21, 1800; Mary, October  16, 1803; Homer, mentioned below. They had  no children recorded in Warren.   (VH) Homer, second son of Joseph (4)  and Ruth (Stockbridge) Ramsdell, was born  August 12, 1 8 10, his descendants say in War-  ren, Massachusetts, but no record of his birth  appears in that town. He died at Newburg,  New York, February 13, 1894. He received  an academic education, and as a youth went  to New York City, where he became clerk in  a dry goods store. In 1832 he became head  of the firm of Ramsdell & Brown, of that city,  being only twenty-two years of age when he  established a large business, dealing in silks,  laces, fancy and white goods. While on his  vacation in June, 1834. making a tour on the  Erie canal, he met his future wife, daughter  of Thomas Powell. He continued in business  in New York imtil 1840. when inducements  were offered to him to remove to Newburg.  there to superintend the many interests of Mr.  Powell. In 1844 Mr. Ramsdell became a mem-     ber of the firm of Thomas Powell & Com-  pany, and was largely the administrator of  Mr. Powell's affairs both before and after his  death in 1856. Mr. Ramsdell continued the  enterprises in which they were both interested  and extended them, or widened their scope, as  conditions changed. On February i, 1865, he  purchased the dock property and barge of B.  Carpenter & Company and consolidated the  business of that firm with that of Homer  Ramsdell & Company. In 1845 ^^^ New York  & Erie railroad, having defaulted in paying its  dividends, a sale of foreclosure seemed inevi-  table. Then Newburg came to the rescue and  Mr. Ramsdell, for services rendered in pro-  curing subscriptions, was made a member of  the board of directors. In 1854 he brought to  bear influences which induced the Erie rail-  road to build a branch to the city of Newburg.  He subscribed heavily to the stock, and  through his instrumentality all the money  needed for construction was advanced. With  the exception of a brief interval he continued  to be a director of that company until 1884.  He was an active advocate of the plan to  change the gauge from broad to the present  standard gauge. Had the policy of the rail-  road been guided by his judgment, the cost  at that time would probably not have exceeded  seventy-five thousand, and when it was ulti-  mately made thirty years later, it cost nearly  seven millions. He was among those who bol-  stered the credit of the company by large pur-  chases of stock at public sales ; encouraged the  contractors, and secured the final completion  of the line to Dunkirk. In 1853 he was elected  president of the company, a difficult position,  which called for large financial and executive  ability, and those who trusted in him were  not disappointed. It was his influence that  secured a proper terminal for the railroad at  Jersey City. He purchased this property tor  about a million dollars, solely on his own ac-  count, taking title and keeping the negotiations  unknown from all, save three personal friends  in the board of directors, until the negotia-  tions were completed. It was through his in-  fluence that the restrictions on terminals for  the road within the state was removed, and a  connection by way of Paterson with Jersey  City made. Previously the road had sufTercd  many hardships in winter because of the fcol-  ish restrictions made by state pride that hotli  termini should be within the state. The ice     1 84     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     at Piermont made winter operation a difficult  and unprotitable matter. Another idea origi-  nated by iMr. Ramsdell was the construction  of the Hawley branch of the Erie in Pennsyl-  vania, connecting with the railroads of the  Pennsylvania Coal Company, and adding im-  mensely to the volume of business on the  Erie line. He was also influential in promot-  ing the construction of the short cut of the  Erie between Vail's Gate on the Newburg  branch and Arden on the main line. He re-  signed the presidency of the Erie in 1857, and  was made receiver of the road in 1876. Dur-  ing all his activities on the part of the com-  pany he never accepted any fee, commission  or other reward for the large sums of money  which he advanced, or for his endorsement or  other financial assistance beyond the legal rate  of interest. He originated the plan of car  trusts by which the equipment of the road was  several times increased, when the road was  in urgent need of rolling stock. In 1886 he  ])laced upon the Hudson two fast steamers,  the 'Newburg' and the 'Homer Ramsdell,'  affording express freight accommodations be-  tween his home city and New York, having  previously by purchase and consolidation  added other neighboring lines, embracing not  only those of Newburg, but also Poughkeepsie  an(l Fishkill, in Dutchess county, and High-  land, in Ulster county.   For a number of years, beginning in i86o,  he was president of the Washington Iron  Works Company of Newburg, whose pay roll  in 1865 amounted to seven hundred thousand  dollars per year. Mr. Ramsdell was vice-  president and director of a company formed  in 1844 which erected the Newburg Steam  Mills, giving employment to hundreds of ]ieo-  ple. He was a member of the first board of  directors of the Newburg Gas Light Com-  l>any, organized in 185 1, and was president of  a company formed in 1850, which built and  operated the Newburg and EUenville plank  road. With many other interests of the town  he was actively identified and contributed to  every elevating movement of his day. From  1841 to 1851 he was a member of the board  of village trustees, and again from 1861 to  i86;. In t86i he was president of the village.  Originally a Whig in politics, on the dissolu-  tion of that narfy he became a Democrat. In  religion he affiliated with the Episcop.Tl church,  and for many years was senior warden of St.     George's church. He Wcx= a leading spirit in  the construction of the Church of the Good  .Sliepherd. As his years advanced he resigned  the details of his business to his sons, but  continued to take an interest in affairs until  failing eyesight made his visits to his office  less frequent. His last days were spent  quietly. The important news of the day was  read to him and he kept largely in touch with  passing events. A stroke of paralysis four  days before his death brought the end. He  was a central figure in the business and social  life of Newburg for many years and was  eminent among the business men of the state,  a leader in every line of finance and commerce  to which he turned his attention. In appear-  ance he was handsome and commanding, with  elegant manners and rare diplomacy. 'As  courteous as Homer Ramsdell' was a standard  often laid before the youths of the community.  With great foresight Mr. Ramsdell saw far  into the future and made men do his will when  unconscious of his purpose. A man of de-  tail, he laid his plans like a general. Though  possessed of wealth, he preferred a life of  business activity to one of ease, and delighted  in liaiulling large affairs. \Vith great breadth  of intellect, he could grasp large matters and  see every detail and understand what related  to them. He planned the construction of the  Erie railroad to Jersey City when other men  of the time considered Piermont as its neces-  sary terminus. To the interests of the com-  munity he a])])lied the same foresight and wide  knowledge of affairs which guided the manage-  men of his own interests. It is said of him  liy a writer in the Newburg Daily Neics that  'The man has never lived who has done so  nuich for Newburg as Homer Ramsdell.' The  same writer says : 'With all his courtesy, gen-  erosity and friendliness, he was a man of iron  will, of firm determination and strict business  jM-inciples. The man who did not deal hon-  estly with him was made to feel that his vel-  vet glove covered a hand of steel. His cool-  ness under trying circumstances, his rare  diplomacy when he found himself matched  against strong men who were trying to out-  general him have been often the subject of  remark. Jim Fisk once said that Homer  Ramsdell could carry more eggs in his arms  without breaking any than any other man he  knew. A homely expression, but it expresses  the idea aright.'     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     185     He married, June 16, 1835, Frances Eliz-  aljeth, daughter of Thomas and Mary (Lud-  low) Powell, of Newburg (see Powell V)-  Children: i. Mary L.

Rains of the Fourth United States Artil-  lery (see Rains).   ( VHl ) James A. Powell, second son of  Homer and Frances Elizabeth ( Powell )  Ramsdell, was born March 9, 1842, in New-  burg, where he has always resided. He at-  tended school until 1857, when at the age of  fifteen years he began working in his father's  warehouse and is now one of the three trus-  tees of the Ramsdell estate in Newburg. He  married Fannie, daughter of John J. Van  Ostrand, of Brooklyn, New York.   (VHI) Henry Powell, third son of Homer  and Frances Elizabeth (Powell) Ramsdell,  was born May 3, 1844, in Newburg. He was  educated in private schools and Mt. Pleasant  Military Academy, at Ossining, New York. On  leaving school he entered the employ of the  Washington Iron W'orks at Newburg as a  clerk. Soon after this he became a soldier  in the civil war. When Colonel A. Van Horn  Ellis was gpthering the One Hundred and  Twenty-fourth Regiment New York Volun-  teers, Henry P. Ramsdell recruited a company,  afterwards known as Company C, with which  he went out as second lieutenant. He was  subsequently promoted successively to first  lieutenant and captain, and at the end of two  years' service resigned on accoimt of ill health  (see history of One Hundred and Twenty-  fourth New York \'olunteer Regiment). Re-  turning to Newburg he resumed connection  with the Washington Iron Works and went to  Titusville, Pennsylvania, as a salesman in its  employ. In 1868 he became a clerk in the  wholesale grocery house of Garbutte. Gri?o-5  K- Company, in New York City, where he  continued about two years. In February, 1870.     he engaged w^ith George W. Severns, a paper  manufacturer, of Salisbury Mills, New York,  which concern failed in April following. Mr.  Ramsdell then purchased this paper mill prop-  erty and conducted business under the name  of the Arlington Paper Company until Febru-  ary I, 1912, when he sold out to the Holdcn  interests and retired from active life. He is  a member of the City and Powellton clubs of  Newburg; of the Union League, Arkwright,  Athletic and City Lunch clubs of New York  City. He is also affiliated with the order of  Free Masons and the Benevolent and Pro-  tective Order of Elks, and the Elks' Club of  Newburg. He is an Episcopalian. He mar-  ried Adele Livingston Voorhees and has one  daughter.   (The Powell Line.)   This name is of Welsh origin and was  originally Ap Howell, being gradually con-  tracted to Powell. The early seat of the fam-  ily was in Brechonshire, South Wales, where  is now the town of Breconshire. It has been  largely represented in the professions, but  most of its bearers have been engaged in agri-  culture. A\'herever found, people of this name  are noted for their industry, thrift and kind,  obliging dispositions. It was brought to this  country by a Quaker family, which has been  conspicuous on Long Island from a very early  period. Happily the English system of keep-  ing records obtained to a large extent among  the English immigrants on Long Island, so  that something can be learned about this fam-  ily.   (I) Thomas Powell was born in \\ ales.  Great Britain, October, 1641, died at West-  bury, Long Island, December 28, 1721. He  was one of the purchasers and patentees of  Huntington, Long Island, in 1664, and was a  man of means and prominence. He purchased,  August 18, 1695, from 'Mawmee, alias Sere-  wanus, William Chepy and all ye rest of ye  Indian proprietors' for and in consideration  of one hundred and forty pounds, the tract  of land on which the village of Rethpage is  now situated. Patents were issued for these  purchases by Governor Dongan to Thomas  Powell in 1664 and 1695. The latter pur-  chase became the family seat. Thomas (2)  settling thereon the same year. Huntington  records show that he was frequently elected  to fill important positions in the township, the  first of which appears to have been in 1663.     i86     SOUTHERX XEW YORK     when at the age of twenty-two years he was  made recorder, which office he held for about  twenty years ; in 1667 he was made constable.  'Every constable shall have a stafif six feet  long with the king's arms on it, as a badge  of his authority.' He was appointed sur-  veyor in 1679, to lay out land in the East Rid-  ing and overseer in 1672. He was again  chosen constable in 1682, but refused to serve,  being 'scrupulous of swearing as the law  directs.' The constable had to sw^ear to levy  and collect the church rates. After the year  K)S8. at which time he was surveyor, he was  more engaged with appointments in Friends'  Meetings than public business. He attended  the monthly meetings which were held alter-  nately at Jericho and Westbury. The last  mention of his name on the records was in  this wise: '28-12 mo. 1721 died Thomas  Powell Senr.. being well respected as a worthy  Friend, and died in Unity with Friends.'   His first wife was unknown. Children: i.  Thomas, mentioned below. 2. Abigail, born  April 18. 1668, died February 9, 1757; mar-  ried Richard Willits, March 15, 1690, at  Huntington, Long Island. 3.

He built the steamboat 'Highlander,' which  was well known on the Hudson in the early  part of the nineteenth century, and later built  the 'Thomas Powell.' the fastest boat on the  water at that time. He engaged largely in  the mercantile business with his brother Jacob  at Newburg, and they were also engaged in  loaning money and exporting goods during the  war of 1812. Thomas Powell was intensely  patriotic and widely known for his upright-  ness as a merchant and business man. He  died May 12, 1856.

He married, April 5, i&jy,  Sarah, daughter of Rev. Joseph Hanmer,  D. D., chaplain of the British forces. They  had twelve children, whose blood flows in  many of the older families of the province  and state of New York. Their second son  was Gabriel, mentioned below.   (VI) (iabriel (3), son of Gabriel (2) I ud-  low, was born in the city of New York,  where he married (first) Frances Duncnn,  and through this marriage are descended the  Livingston Ludlows, the Verplancks, the  Dashwoods and the Carrolls of New York.  He married (second) Elizabeth, daughter of  Daniel Crommelin, one of the proprietors of  the Wawayanda patent in Orange county.  Among their children was Robert Cromnielin,  mentioned below.   (VII) Robert Crommelin, son of Gabriel  (3) Ludlow, was born in New York, and iti  1796 settled in Newburg, intending to engage  in the mercantile business, but fell a victim to  consumption in the vigorous years of man-  hood. He married, in 1781, Elizabeth Conk-  ling, by whom he had three sons and four  daughters.   (VIII) Mary, eldest daughter of Robert  Crommelin Ludlow, became the wife of  Thomas Powell (see Powell V).     This old Dutch name has  nURL.'\ND many spellings among the   descendants, such as Dor-  land, Dorlin and numerous other forms. It  has been conspicuous in the settlement of va-  rious districts in New York, and chieflv iden-  tified for many generations with agriculture  and mechanic arts. In recent generations it has  been largely connected with mercantile and  professional life.   (I) Jan Gerretse Dorlandt, born about  1625-7, came from Holland in 1632 and set-  tled in the village of Brooklyn. His first resi-  dence was near the Fulton street ferry, and  he removed later to the village of Bedford, in  Brooklyn township, where he was residing in  1657. He had a farm of forty acres at the     i88     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     east end of Bedford, adjoining what is now  Fulton street. His name is on the assessment  roll of Brooklyn township in 1675, and on  April 6, 1677, he purchased meadow lot No. 18  in Flatbush. ' In a list of taxpayers in 1683  his property is valued at eighty-three pounds,  including four horses and nine head of neat  cattle of various ages, and a poll, eighteen  pounds. In 1687 he subscribed to the oath of  allegiance to the English government, and in  that year was elected town commissioner of  Brooklyn, continuing to fill that office, which  wa.'i equivalent to the modern town supervisor,  until 1701 or later. In 1699 he was collector  of Brooklyn, and was living in 171 1. The  name of his first wife is unknown, but he was  married before 1655, when a son was born.  The mother died between 1663 and 1666. He  married (second) in 1667, Anna Remsen,  daughter of Rem Jansen Vandcrbeeck and  Jannetji Rapalie. Both were members of the  Reformed Dutch church of Brooklyn in 1677.  and in 171 1 he was an elder of this church,  where several of his children were baptized.

The American ancestor of the  PECK Peck family of Troy herein con-  sidered was William Peck, who  was among the first of the early settlers of  New England. Others of the name arrived  at about the same time, but apparently were  not related. They were the progenitors of a  numerous posterity, and the name is a distin-  guished one in the United States.   (I) W'illiam Peck was born in or near the  city of London, England, in 1601, and married  there about the year 1622. His son Jeremiah  was the only English-born child. William  Peck, with his wife Elizabeth and son Jere-  miah, emigrated from England to America,  coming in the company with Governor Eaton,  Rev. John Davenport and others in the ship  'Hector,' arriving at Boston from London,  June 26, 1637. This company, consisting  largely of merchants and farmers, had suf-  fered much from the intolerance and persecu-  tions of the reign of King Charles L and their  object in coming to America was to secure  unmolested enjoyment of civil and religious  liberty. William Peck was one of the original  I)roprietors of New Haven, Connecticut, his  autograph signature being affi-xed to the agree-  ment or constitution, dated June 4, 1639. for  the government of the infant colony ('this is  said to be 'one of the first examples in his-  tory of a written constitution organizing a  government and defining its powers'). He was  admitted a freeman of the colony, October 20.  1640; was a merchant, and a trustee, treasurer  and general business agent of the Colony Col-     legiate School, established on the basis of the  Hopkins' fund. He is usually named in the  records with the title of 'Mr,' then a prefix  of respect and distinction. From 1659 until  his death he was a deacon of the church in  New Haven. His home lot of about an acre,  his house and store were on Church street,  the front of which is now covered by the  Connecticut Savings Bank building. His grave  is now covered by the Center Church in New  Haven. He died October 4, 1694, aged ninety-  three years. His will, dated March 9, 1688-89,  probated October 13, 1694, is recorded in the  probate records of New Haven (Book H, p.  176). His wife Elizabeth died December 5,  1683. He married (second) Sarah, widow of  William Holt. His children, all by first wife,  survived him, as did his second wife, and are  all named in his will. i. Jeremiah, see for-  ward. 2.

He is said by Cot-  ton Alathcr to have been a student at Har-  vard, and undoubtedly was, as he was pos-  sessed of a good education. His name does  not, however, appear in the catalogue of grad-  uates of any year. He was for a time of  (luilford, Connecticut, preaching or teaching  until 1660, when he removed to New Haven in  response to an invitation to take charge of  the Collegiate school, which had been insti-  tuted in New Haven by the general court in  1659. He was in charge of the school until  the summer of 1661, when it was temporarily  suspended for lack of support. After a few  years it was revived and flourishes now under  the name of the Johns Hopkins Grammar  School. In the fall of 1661 he was invited  to preach at Saybrook, Connecticut, where he  is sujiposcd to have been ordained, as he set-  tled there as a minister, dating frpm Septem-  ber 25, 1661. He remained in Saybrook until  t666, when he removed to Guilford. Dif-  ficulties arose in the Synod, which decided  him to leave Connecticut. He removed later  in 1666 to Newark, New Jersey, where he re-  sided on the corner of Market and Mulberrv     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     193     streets. He preached in the neighboring  towns, but not in Newark. In 1669, or 1670,  he settled as the minister of Ehzabethtown,  New Jersey, declining calls to other churches  until 1678, when he became the first settled  minister of the church in Greenwich, Con-  necticut. He remained here until 1689, and in  1691 became the first settled minister of the  church at Waterbury, Connecticut, continuing  here, discharging most of his official duties  until his death, June 7, 1699. He was a man  of much usefulness, both as a teacher and a  minister on the frontier settlements among the  early colonists.

He served  in several campaigns, and was in the battle at  White Plains. After the war he resided in  North Salem, New York, and there married,  November 18, 1784, Mindwell, daughter of  Solomon Close, Jr., and shortly afterwards  went to Galway, New York, where he resided  until 1794, and then removed to and resided  in Clifton Park, New York, until his decease  there, November 12, 1848.

(VI) John (2), son of John (i) and Sa-  rah (Adams') Peck, was born November 12,  1742, died September ig, 1819. In 1775,  when but thirty-two years of age, he was a  veteran of a long war and accustomed to a  military life. He had served in the army for  four years during the then recent French  war, and subsequently became an active mem-  ber of the militia. He enlisted in the Eighth  Company. Captain Thomas Lee. Fifth Regi-  ment of the New York Line, Colonel Lewis  Dubois, December 26, 1776, for three years  or during the war and was mustered out,  January, 1782. He appears to have served  part of his enlistment, from February 10,  1777, to May, 1779, in the First Company.  Captain Rosekrans, of the same regiment.  Subsequent to the expiration of his first three  years of service he was in the winter of 1780  a member of the Light Company of the same  Fifth Regiment. He served in the battle at  White Plains. Colonel Dubois was in com-  mand of his regiment at the capture of Fort  Montgomery, October 6. 1777, and his lieuten-  ant-colonel and major were taken prisoners,  and in this battle John Peck was serving. He  was reported missing October 6, 1777, with  a large number of others of that company.  There is complete evidence, both direct and  circumstantial, that John Peck was not only  a revolutionary soldier for upwards of six  years, but was during all that time a conti-  nental soldier of the war. In 1772 John Peck  removed to Crcat Nine Partners, in that part  now Stanford, Dutchess county. New York.  In 1780 he moved to Little Nine Partners,  in that part now Milan, same countv, where  he remained until 1788, then returned to     Stanford, and in 1792 removed west of the  Hudson river to what is now Hunter, Greene  county, New York. In February, 1795, he  settled in Sherburne, Chenango county. New  York, where he resided until his death. He  was a man of superior natural talents, great  firmness and energy, one of the enterprising  valuable pioneers in the settlement of New  York state.   He married, in October. 1764.

In 1804 he settled at  Cazenovia, New York, as pastor of the Bap-  tist church, continuing until his death. He  was a distinguished minister of the Baptist  church, and eminent for his devotion to pas-  toral duty, his fervid eloquence and his con-  servative theological tendencies.

He resided after the war in Dutchess, Che-  nango and Yates counties. New York. He  married, about 1775, Ruth Meade, born May  27, 1757. daughter of Jonathan and Sarah  Meade, of the town of North East, Dutchess  county. New York.

(\TII) Judge Darius Peck, eldest son of  Rev. John (3) and Sarah (Ferris) Peck, was  born in Norwich. Chenango county. New York,  June 5. 1802, died October 27, 1879.

He compiled and published in  1887 'A Genealogical Account of the De-  scendants in the Male Line of William Peck.'

Elon Huntington Hooker, who  HOOKER recently laid aside active busi-  ness for a few months to be-  come chairman of the Finance Committee and  National Treasurer of the Progressive Party,  is a very successful young business man with  a rarely forceful personality which has im-  pressed itself upon all who have come to  know him in his business and social worlds.  A splendid persistence, backed up by a broad  intellectuality and magnificent phvsical pow-  ers have enabled him to win out in his busi-  ness career and to command the confidence  of a wide circle of the shrewdest business  men of the country. His associates and ac-  quaintances have learned that when he starts  out to do a thing that thing is very apt to be  done, no matter what the difficulties and op-  position.     Mr. Hooker is new in the political world,  but is already making himself felt in his work  for the Progressive party, because of his un-  remitting industry and enthusiasm, his power  of convincing, and the confidence which his  personality and record inspire in everyone he  deals with. He became a worker for Theo-  dore Roosevelt because he admires the man  and believes in his principles. Mr. Hooker  is a civil engineer as well as a business man.   The Hooker family has long been settled in  Hartford. Connecticut, and in Rochester. New-  York, and is one of the oldest in the United  States, dating back to the early history of  New England, where Thomas Hooker, of  whom Mr. Hooker is a lineal descendant,  founded the city of Hartford and the colony  of Connecticut. According to John Fiske, the  .American historian, Thomas Hooker, by origi-  nating and outlining the constitution of Con-  necticut, became the real designer of the  framework of our present federal constitu-  tion.   (I) John Hooker was of Devonshire, Eng-  land. He had a brother Roger, and a sister  Mary, who married John Russell, of Leices-  tershire. Children of John Hooker: John,  lived in Somersetshire ; Thomas, see forward ;  Rev. Zachary, rector of St. Michael's, Cath-  ays, Cornwall.   (H) Thomas, son of John Hooker, was of  Devonshire. He married and had children :  A daughter, who married Dr. George .Alcock.  of London; Rev. Thomas, see forward; Dor-  othy, married John Chester, of Leicestershire.   (HI) Rev. Thomas (2) Hooker, son of  Thomas ( i ) Hooker, was the immigrant an-  cestor of the Hooker family here dealt with,  and was born at Marfield, Leicestershire. Eng-  land, July 7, 1586. Cotton Mather in his  Magnalia says of him : 'He was born of  parents that were neither unable nor unwill-  ing to bestow on him a liberal education ;  whereunto the early, lively sparkles of wit  observed in him did much to encourage them;  his natural temper was cheerful and courte-  ous ; but it was accomplished with such a sens-  ible grandeur of mind, as caused his friends,  without the help of astrology, to prognosticate  that he was born to the considerable.' Re-  garding his education and conversion, Sprague  says : 'He was educated at Emmanuel Col-  lege. Cambridge, of which in due time he  became a fellow. He acquitted himself in     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     197     this office with such ability and fidelity as to  secure universal respect and admiration. It  was while he was thus employed that he be-  came deeply impressed with the importance  of the eternal realities, and after a protracted  season of bitter anguish of spirit, he was en-  abled to submit without reserve to the terms  of the Gospel, and thus find peace and joy in  believing. His religious experience in the  very commencement seems to have been un-  commonly deep and thorough ; and no doubt it  was partly owing to this that he became so  much distinguished in after life as a counsel-  lor, comforter and guide to the awakened and  desponding.' He frequently preached at  Cambridge and for some time in London and  its vicinity. In 1826 he became a lecturer and  assistant to the Rev. Mr. Mitchell at Chelms-  ford, and among his hearers were noblemen  and others of high standing in English society.  He was accustomed once a year to visit his  native county, and was once asked to preach  in the great church of Leicester. One cf the  chief burgesses of the town was greatly op-  posed to his preaching there, and not being  able to hinder him, he set persons fiddling in  the churchyard with a view to disturbing him.  But Mr. Hooker was able to retain command  of his audience, and at last even the fiddler  went to the door to listen, and the story goes  on to say that his conversion followed.   In 1630 a spiritual court which held its ses-  sions at Chelmsford silenced Mr. Hooker for  nonconformity. Although he was in accord  with the doctrines of the English church, there  were certain forms of worship which he could  not practice, and on this ground he was for-  bidden to minister to the people. He contin-  ued, however, to live near Chelmsford, and  was employed in teaching a school at a place  called Little Braddow, having John Eliot,  afterwards the famous Indian apostle, in his  family as an usher. A petition signed by  forty-seven ministers of the established church  was sent to the spiritual court asking to have  Mr. Hooker established, but it did no good.  After a short residence in retirement under  the patronage of his friend, the Earl of War-  wick, he determined to seek a home in Hol-  land, and his steps were watched by his per-  secutors, he being followed even to the shore,  but the ship fortunately got off to sea before  his pursuers arrived. Mr. Hooker remained  in Holland for three years and was at first     employed as an assistant to Mr. Paget, at  Amsterdam. On account of a misunderstand-  ing with him, Mr. Hooker removed to Delft,  and was associated with the Rev. Mr. Forbes,  a Scotch minister. Two years later he ac-  cepted a call to Rotterdam to assist the Rev.  Dr. William Ames. Dr. Ames is said to have  remarked that he never met a man the equal  of Mr. Hooker as a preacher or as a learned  disputant.   Mr. Hooker decided to go to New Eng-  land, but wished to return to England first,  as the times were supposed to be a little more  tolerant. Upon his arrival there, however, he  found that his enemies were still active, and  he was obliged to live in concealment until  the time of his departure from England to  America. He left England about the middle  of July, 1633, from the Downs, on the ship  'Griffin.' Such was his peril that he and his  friend, Mr. Cotton, were obliged to remain  in concealment until the ship had put out to  sea. He arrived at Boston, Massachusetts,  September 4, 1633, and on October 11, was  chosen pastor of the church at Newtown  (Cambridge). He remained there to the great  satisfaction of the people for two and a half  years. In June, 1636, he joined the company  of those who went to make a settlement at  Hartford, Connecticut, and from this time was  identified with all the most important move-  ments of the colony. He was one of the  moderators of the first New England synod  held at Cambridge, in the case of the cele-  brated Ann Hutchinson. He published many  books and sermons between 1637 and his  death. He fell a victim to a violent epidemic  disease and died July 7, 1647, a great loss  to the community. The Rev. Thomas Hooker,  according to family tradition, married a sister  of John Pym, who was an intimate friend.  Children : Rev. John, about 1636 returned to  England and there married and settled in the  established church at Maseworth, Bucks;  Joanna, born about 1615, died April, 1616;  Mary, born about 1618, married the Rov.  Roger Newton, first pastor of Farmington,  later of Milford, Connecticut; Sarah, born  about 1630, married the Rev. John Wilson, of  Medfield ; a daughter, who married and be-  came a widow ; Samuel, see forward.   flV) Rev. .Samuel Hooker, son of the Rev.  Thomas (2) Hooker, was born in 1633. He  was educated at Harvard College, from which     198     SOUTIIKRX XEW YORK     he was graduated in 1653. He succeeded the  Rev. Roger Newton, his brother-in-law, and  was the second pastor of the church at Farm-  ington, where he was ordained in July, 1661.  He was on a committee of four in 1662 to  treat with the New Haven colony in reference  to the proposed union with Connecticut un-  der one colonial government. .A.11 the de-  scendants of the Rev. Thomas Hooker, bear-  ing the name of Hooker, are also his de-  scendants. He was a fellow of Harvard, and  on account of his earnestness and piety was  called the 'fervent Hooker.' He had a habit  of committing his sermons to memory and  was a powerful and effective preacher. He  died at Farmington, November 6, 1697. He  married, September 22, 1658, Mary Willctt,  of Swansea. ^Massachusetts, afterwards of  .Seakonk, Rhode Island. Her mother was  Mary (Brown) Willett.

Like his progenitor he had the spirit  of the pioneer, and the glowing accounts of  the Genesee country attracted him to western  New York, where so many Hartford and  Windsor families had settled. He lived for  a short time at Bristol, near Canandaigua,  where he engaged in mercantile business with  his brother, Alexander Allin, and later he  went to Carthage, near Rochester, to co-oper-  ate with his brother-in-law. Judge Strong, in  developing what was supposed to be the future  city of Genesee. He was for twenty years  engaged in active commercial enterprises, and  through all his business vicissitudes he re-  mained a courtly gentleman of the strictest  integrity and high moral character, a power  in the community in which he lived. He mar-  ried, September 3, 1822, Helen, daughter of  Erastus and Chloe (Bissell) \\'olcott, of  Windsor, Connecticut, born March 9, 1794.     died April 4, 1840. Mrs. Hooker was a great  granddaughter of Governor Roger Wolcott,  and came from the long line of Connecticut  and Massachusetts governors of this name.  Children: I.

(IX) Horace B., son of Horace and Helen  (\\'olcott) Hooker, was born at Rochester,  New York, December 7, 1837. He was a  lieutenant (acting captain) in the First Mis-  souri Engineers during the civil war. He  married, November 14, 1861, Susan Pamelia,  born August 18, 1841, daughter of Elon and  Annjeannette (Cole) Huntington, of Roches-  ter, New York. These Huntingtons were  prominent in the early history of the United  States, one of the family being governor of  Connecticut and president of the colonial con-  gress. Children of Mr. and Mrs. Hooker:  Albert Huntington, born at Rochester, No-  vember 2'5. 1865; a son, not named, born and  died July 12, 1867; Frances Margaret Hunt-  ington, born June 10, 1868: Elon Huntington,  see forward ; a daughter, not named, born  and died September 6, 1871 ; Harry Mix, born  July 18, 1872 ; Paul, February, 1875 • Horace  \\'illard, November 2, 1876; Jeanette Hunt-  ington, December 24, 1881 ; Thomas, May 4,  1883, died September 12, 1884, at Rochester.   (X) Elon Huntington, son of Horace B.  and Susan Pamelia (Huntington) Hooker,  was born in Rochester. New York, November  23, 1869. He received his early education in  the public schools of Rochester and continued  his technical training in the night schools of  the Mechanics Institute for a period of sev-  eral years. He then entered the University  of Rochester, from which he was graduated  in the classical course with the class of 1891.  His vacations were spent in field engineering  under the able training of Emil Kuichling,  the well known hydraulic engineer. He was  a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity  at Rochester, and was prominent in athletics,  being a member of the football team and a     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     tennis player of intercollegiate rank. He was  also manager of the University Glee and  Banjo Club. He worked his way througli  college. After his graduation at Rochester he  went to Cornell University as a resident grad-  uate and covered the civil engineering course  in two years. There he was a formidable  worker, who alternated his studies with pe-  riods where he earned enough funds to get  through his engineering course. He managed,  while contiiuiing his course at Cornell, to  find time for original investigation along sci-  entific lines and to wrest from the faculty, in  addition to his regular engineering degree, a  degree as Doctor of Philosophy, lie has also  the degrees of Bachelor and Master of Arts  from Rochester. His success at Cornell won  him a traveling fellowship, which allowed him  to go abroad to continue his hydraulic studies  at the Zurich Polytechnicum and the Ecole  des Fonts and Chaussees, at Paris.   Returning to this country, Mr. Hooker  spent several years in engineering work in the  field, and was one of a commission of con-  tracting engineers who inspected the Panama  and \icaraugua canal routes in 189S. His  first personal contact with Theodore Roose-  velt came when the latter was governor of  New York and ajjiiointed Mr. Hooker deputy  superintendent of public works, in which po-  sition he shared the responsibility for the  operation and maintenance of the state canals  and roads, and was esjiecially engaged in the  investigation of the expenditures under the  preceding nine million dollar improvement to  the Erie Canal System. In 1901 Mr. Hooker  resigned to engage in timber, mining and rail-  road enterprises in the southwest. Two years  later he organized and became president of  the Development and Funding Company,  building and operating engineering and indus-  trial enterprises. Shortly afterwards he and  his associates formed the Hooker Electro-  chemical Company, a concern which has a  large manufacturing plant at Niagara Falls.  New York, and produces caustic soda and  chloride of lime by electrolysis of rock salt.  The business cm])loys nine thousand horse  power and has now been in operation, day and  night, for about eight years, and has proved  a great engineering success as well as a very  profitable investment. It is generally admit-  ted by specialists here and abroad that the     Hooker plant is higher in efficiency than any  plant of the same kind now in existence.   Mr. Hooker is a man of high ideals of a  practical kind, which bring with them a rea-  sonable hope of realization. His friends say  of him that he is ready always to listen to  advice and to gain whatever advantage there  may l>e in the suggestions of his associates,  giving them the credit both financially and  otherwise for what they have contributed. He  has devoted some of his time to writing pam-  phlets that have had an important intluence  in their field. He is the author of: 'Storage  Capacity in Lakes and Reservoirs.' 1894;  'Some References on River Hydraulics.'  1895 ; and 'The Suspension of Solids in  Flowing Water.' i8q6. In politics he was a  Republican until the Chicago convention  which nominated Taft, then he cast his lot  with the Progressive party. Mr. Hooker is  a memljer of the Cornell Association of Civil  Engineers, the Sigma Xi Society, the Lake  Mohonk Arbitration Conference and the Na-  tional Municipal League. Among his New  York clubs are : The Century, LTniversity,  .Alpha Delta Phi, Cornell and Seawanhaka-  Corinthian Yacht Club. He has business of-  fices at 40 Wall street. New York City.   While he was taking advantage of his  European fellowship, Mr. Hooker met in  Rome, Blanche, daughter of the late D. M.  Ferry, one of the most prominent bankers  and men of Detroit, Michigan. Miss Ferry  had just been graduated from Vassar Col-  lege, of which institution, Dr. James M. Tay-  lor, an uncle of Mr. Hooker, is president. Mr.  Hooker and Miss Ferry were married in De-  troit, January 25, 1901, and they have four  daughters. They live in an artistically con-  ceived, old-fashioned house at Greenwich,  Connecticut, which bears the marks of the  refined taste of the present owners, who had  it rebuilt to suit their own individualilv.     In many cases the family of  BUCKLEY Buckley is probably derived   from the name of the hamlet  of Buckley in Lancashire, which gave resi-  dence and name to a family descended in  England from John De Buckley, whose broth-  er Geoffrey was Dean of \Vhalley in the  reign of King Stephen. This John had a son  GeofTrey, whose son Geoffrey was slain at     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     the battle of Evesham in the year 1265. Adam  de Buckley attested deeds in 1339 and 1359,  and another John in 1370 and 1390, this lat-  ter being probably son of a Robert Bockeley  and married Alice Wolfenden. Elias Buckley  in 1434 might be a son of John and Alice  Buckley, and was father of Rafe who mar-  ried Katherine, the surname of the wife re-  maining unrecorded. Thomas Buckley, wit-  ness to a deed May 18, 1507, was probably a  descendant. James Buclcy, of Bucley, of this  family, it appears November 12, 1512, mar-  ried Alice Howarth, of Howarth, and had  issue : Thomas, and Catherine, who married  Thomas Chadwike. This Thomas Bucley at-  tested deeds, January i, 1534-35, and again  May 16, 1561, August 16, 1580, and October  22. 1 58 1. He married Grace, daughter of  Arthur Ashton, of Great Clegg. James Buck-  ley, who was another witness of the deed in  1581, was probably his son. Of the same  family was Lawrence Buckley, who with one  Edmund Ashton in 1567 was sued by Sir  John Byron (ancestor of the poet) and oth-  ers, the inhabitants of Rochdale, in Lancash-  ire, about the right of way over property at  Butterworth and other common rights. Two  years later Barnards Buckley, apparently his  brother, had to establish his right to his in-  heritance by suit at law against Roger Gart-  side and John Holte, and lost part of it, con-  sisting of land at Castleton. This Barnards  was probably a cousin of Catherine Buckley,  of Chedale, aunt of Sir Richard Buckley,  Knight, who made her will November 16,  1559, in which she mentions by name her  brothers, Thomas, Robert and '\\'illiam, the  latter deceased. William Buckley died in the  early part of Queen Elizabeth's reign, pos-  sessed of lands at Quicke and Suddleworth in  Yorkshire, and Abell, his great-grandson, be-  came the heir general of the family in the  reign of King Charles the First. Robert  Buckley appears to have been the oldest of  Catherine Buckley's brothers and died appar-  ently without issue in 1557. possessed of  Messury, Terr. Bosc, etc., at Buckley Manor  and Hundersfelde in Lancashire. Sir Richard  Buckley, Knight, living in 1619, who married  Annie, sister of Sir Thomas Wilsford. was  his descendant. The Buckleys are also nu-  merous in Ireland, the name in this case being  a translation or anglicized form from Mac  Ficheaill (mac, 'son', and ficheaill, Gaelic.     'buckle''), the name Mac Ficheaill or Buck-  ley being derived from Gillacaemghin na  Ficheaill, son of Bhaltair or Walters or Wal-  ter, who is one hundred and eighteenth link  on the pedigree stem of the Ui Tuathail fam-  ily or clan, anciently chiefs of Hy-Muirea-  daigh, afterwards Kings of Leinster and  J'rinces of Imaile. The Buckleys, Viscounts  of Cashel, were a branch of this ancient fam-   ( I ) John Buckley, the immigr;uit ancestor  of the Buckley family in America here dealt  with, was living in Leipsic, Germany, where  he was drafted against his will into the Hes-  sian army that was sent to this country during  the revolutionary war to aid the British. At  the battle of Saratoga, when General Bur-  goyne surrendered, he was captured and sent  to Boston, where he escaped and settled in  New Hampshire at Jaflfray. The time of his  coming to this country would be about the  year 1777, and he was probably then a little  over twenty years old. He married, about  the year 1784, Margaret Dunlap, and had  children among whom was John Jr., men-  tioned below.   (H) John (2), son of John (i) and Mar-  garet (Dunlap) Buckley, was born at Jaffray,  New Hampshire, May 3, 1786, died at Marl-  boro, New York, June i, 1870. He spent his  youth in his native town, and received his  education in the public schools of the same  place. When he was old enough he learned  the wheelwright and machinist trades, and in  1805 he was employed by Almy & Brown, of  Providence, Rhode Island, where he remained  for three years. In 1809 the Pleasant Valley  Cotton Manufacturing Company was organ-  ized in Dutchess county. New York, and he  was engaged to superintend the construction  of the water wheel and running gear. Later  he was invited to join the Cornwall Cotton  Manufacturing Company, chartered in 181 1,  where he became a stockholder and superin-  tended the building of their wheel and ma-  chinery. In 18 1 5 he purchased a carding and  spinning mill, and a small farm in Marlboro,  where he commenced carding and spinning  wool for the farmers of Orange and Dutchess  counties. In 1822 he enlarged the mill and  took his brothers-in-law, James and John  Thorne, and the mill was again enlarged and  was known as the Marlboro Woolen Factory,  making broadcloths and satinettes. Their     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     products were regularly exhibited at the fairs  in New York, and in 1823 they received a  premium of a silver pitcher for the best piece  of blue broadcloth manufactured from Amer-  ican wool. The firm was dissolved in 1830,  Mr. Buckley continuing until 1855, in which  year he converted his factory into a cotton  mill making twine and cotton warp until the  year 1861, when he retired. A period of about  nine years elapsed between the date of his  retirement and the date of his death. He was  originally a Quaker, then Presbyterian, and  later joined the Episcopal church at Marl-  boro, New York. He was an ardent Repub-  lican in politics. He was a particularly hearty  supporter of the principles advocated by  Henry Clay.   The following is an item from the press  relating to John (2) Buckley: 'The first pub-  lic sermon of the Protestant Episcopal Church  of Marlboro was held February 12, 1837, in  the district school house and among the lead-  ing persons present were: Edward Arm-  strong, Thomas Fyfe, John Buckley, Gabriel  Merritt. Leonard S. Carpenter, and others'.   The following item also refers to John (2)  Buckley: 'Christ Church, Marlboro, was  consecrated March 26. 1858, by Bishop Hor-  atio Potter, and was attended by a large num-  ber of pastors from New York, Brooklyn and  other towns along the Hudson. After the  ceremonies were concluded the bishop and  clergy were hospitably entertained at the  home of Mr. John Buckley Sr.'   He married, about the year 181 5. Phoebe  Thorne. The children were: i. Johii |r., born  at Cornwall, New York. October 23, 1814,  died at Marlboro, New York, September 27!  1803; married Catherine Sands, of Cornwall,  New York, June 17, 1840; there were no chil-  dren: he passed most of his married life in  New York; was a money broker and about  1880 returned to Marlboro, passing the re-  mainder of his days in the Buckley homestead ;  clo.sely identified witli Christ Episcopal  Church, Marlboro, being vestryman from 1850  to 1859. also 1876 to 1870. 2.' Thomas Town-  send, mentioned below. 3. Margaret, died in  1872. 4. William P., mentioned below. 5  Mercy Townsend, a member of Christ Epis-  copal Church, Marlboro; still occupies the old  homestead.   (HI) Thomas Townsend, second son of  John (2) and Phoebe (Thorne) Buckley, was     born July 11, 1817, at Marlboro, New York,  died February 6, 1887. He attended the vil-  lage schools of his native town, and at the  age of fourteen he became a clerk in a gen-  eral store at Marlboro, later securing a clerk-  ship in Nevvburg, New York. In the year  1838 he went to New York and engaged in  the wholesale dry goods business, and soon  became largely interested in the importing and  jobbing trade. In 1874 he retired from active  business, spending his summers in his native  town of Marlboro, and the winters in Brook-  lyn. He was vice-president of the Bank of  the Republic, receiver for the Atlantic & Pa-  cific railroad, and director of the Metropolitan  Gas Company and Home Insurance Company.  He was a member and patron of the art and  historical societies. He married, in 1844,  Amelia A., born December. 1818, died June  i.^. i<*^93. daughter of William R. Thompson,  of New York. Children: i. William T..  rnentioned below. 2. John D., mentioned be-  low. 3. Charles R., mentioned below.   (HI) William F., third son of John (2)  and Phoebe (Thorne) Buckley, was born in  1820 at Marlboro. New York, died November  29, 1902. He was a man of wide business  experience, clear judgment, strict integrity  and a high sense of duty. After several years'  experience in a silk importing house in New  York he purchased and loaded a vessel for  San Francisco in 1840 and took out as a part  of his cargo the timber and machinery of the  first steamboat which ascended the Sacra-  mento river. He was afterwards associated  with the banking firm of Geldermeister De  Fremery & Company, which built, after disas-  trous fires had laid the city to waste, the first  fire-proof structure in San Francisco. Re-  turning to New York in 1854 he engaged in  the shipping and commission business, and  after the civil war established a branch of  the firm of N. L. and G. Griswold in New  Orleans. In 1873 he became interested in  railroads and served at different times as  director of the Atlantic & Pacific railroad, the  St. Louis & San Francisco railroad, the Mis-  souri Pacific railroad, and the Mahopac Falls  railroad. He was one of the incorporators n\  the St. Louis & San Francisco Company, ami  was for many years its treasurer. In 1875  lie was chosen to succeed Samuel J. Tilden as  president of the New York Balana Drv Dock     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     203     Company, a position he held for many years.  In 1889 he was one of the incorporators of  the New York Security & Trust Company.  Two years previously he had heen elected a  trustee of the New York Life and at different  times served as a member of the supervisory  and agency committee, the finance committee,  and the loss, auditing and executive commit-  tee.   (IV) Wilham T., eldest son of Thomas  Townsend and Amelia A. (Thompson) Buck-  ley, was born at Brooklyn, New York, Sep-  tember 20, 1848, died in January, 1898. He  was educated at a private school and was  three years at Columbia College, New York.  He left college in order to go into the dry  goods business, becoming in course of time a  partner in Buckley, Welling & Company. In  the year 1875 Buckley, Welling & Company  went out of business and he became a partner  in Dunham, Buckley & Company, continuing  in the business until January i, 1898. He  married, in November, 1870, Frederica R.,  daughter of William C. Fowler. Children :  I. Margaret Requa, died in infancy. 2. Thom-  as T., born May 9, 1875. 3. Freida Requa.  born May 30, 1879, ^i^d in 1888.   (IV) John D., second son of Thomas  Townsend and Amelia A. (Thompson) Buck-  ley, was born March 30, 1850, at Brooklyn,  New York. He was educated at the Poly-  technic Institute, Brooklyn. New York. In  1870 he became engaged in the wholesale gro-  cery business in New York and continued  until the year 1898 when he retired. He  married, September 21. 1887, Mary, daughter  ■of EH A. Bronson, of Geneva, New York.  There has been one daughter of the marriage,  Marian Dunlap.   (I\') Charles Ramsay, third son of Thomas  Townsend and Amelia A. (Thompson) Buck-  ley, was born at Brooklyn, New York, ^ilarch  5, 1852. He was educated at the Polytechnic  Institute, Brooklyn, and graduated at Colum-  bia University in the class of 1874. He also  graduated frnm the Sclmcil of Mines in the  class of 1877. In addition he spent one year  at the Columbia Law School. For a short  time he was engaged in the mining business,  but is now retired. He married Agnes, daugh-  ter of Eli A. Bronson, of Geneva, New York ;  there has been one dsughter of the marriage,  Isobel Ramsav.     This is a very old Dutch family,  ROOSA early identified with the history   of Southern New York, and still  has numerous representatives scattered over  the region. It appears very early in the set-  tlement at Kingston, and Ulster county owes  much of its development and progress to the  industry, intelligence and enterprise of this  family.   (I)' Albert Heyman Roosa (whose father  was Heyman when surnames were unknown  among the Dutch people) arrived in New  Netherlands in April, 1660, in the ship 'Spot-  ted Cow'', coming from Gelderland, Holland,  He was accompanied by his wife, Wyntje Al-  lard. and eight children. He settled in that  part of Esopus which is now the town of  Hurley, Ulster county. New York, and there  engaged in farming. He participated in the  first administration of the Lord's Supper at  Esopus, December 25, 1660. Being possessed  of considerable means he owned much prop-  erty and exercised a large influence in the  community. In the spring of 1661 his name  was entered on a contract to secure the salary  of Dominie Bloem at Wiltwyck, now Kings-  ton. On the organization of the village of  Hurley he was one of the first three schepens.  or magistrates, who administered the affairs  of the community. In 1661 he was one of a  committee of three to enclose the village of  Hurley as a means of protection against the  Indians. He owned lot No. 24, where his  home was destroyed by the Indians, June 7,  1663, at which time two of his children were  carried away captives. He was one of those  who resented the tuijust treatment accorded  to the people of the village by the British  soldiers then quartered there in 1667, and  because of his vigorous resistance he was  adjudged guilty of sedition by the court in  New York and banished from the colony. He  was, however, restored to favor in 1669 by  Governor Lovelace, who appointed him one  of the overseers of New Dorp (Hurley). In  the same year he was granted the privilege of  setting up tanning vats and a brewing house.  He was one of the petitioners for the ap-  pointment of a minister, who could speak both  Dutch and English ; served as a mustering  officer : on April 5, 1670, was a sergeant in  Captain Henry Pawling's company of militia,  and in 1673 was captain of a company com-  posed of men from Hurley and Marbletown.     204     SOUTHERN XEW YORK     He died at Hurley, February 27, 1679, and  in 1685 his widow was granted three hundred  and twenty acres of land on account of his  public service. Children: Arie, Heyman,  Jan, Albertse, Ikee, Maritje, Neeltien, Jan-  nitje, Aert, Annatje, Guert.   (H) Jan Albertse, third son of Albert Hey-  man and W'yntje (Allard) Roosa, resided in  Hurley, New York. He married Hillegond  VVillems \^an Buren. The family came from  Holland and was known by the name of Wil-  liams. He was a town officer, October 19,  1708.   (HI) Albert Jansen, son of Jan Albertse  and Hillegond (Williams) Roosa, resided in  Hurley, New York, where he received deeds  for land March 24, 1724, and September 27,  1742. He was elected colonel of the Hurley  militia, April 5, 1720; fence viewer in 1721 ;  trustee, 1722-27-32-37. In 1738 his name ap-  pears on the muster roll of a foot company  commanded by Captain Cornelis Wynkoop.  He married, in 1709, Rebecca Schepmoes, bap-  tized at Kingston, New York, November 6,  1687, daughter of Derick and Marye (Wil-  liams) Schepmoes. They had children bap-  tized at Kingston: Dirck, October 2. 1715:  Abraham, mentioned below ; Hillegond, died  young; Zara, December 2, 1722; Hillegond,  September 5, 1725; Ysaak, May 19, 1728.   (IV) Abraham, second son of Albert Jan-  sen and Rebecca (Schepmoes) Roosa, was  baptized March 23. 1718, in Kingston, New  York, and probably resided at Hurley, which  was under the ecclesiastic jurisdiction of  Kingston. Because of the remoteness of resi-  dence it is apparent that many members of  this family were not recorded at Kingston.  The banns for the marriage of Abraham  Roosa to Elizabeth Rutsz were published  June 17, 1744, at Kingston, and they were  given a certificate July 8, following, but the  date of marriage is not in the church records.  She was baptized November 15, 1724, ac-  cording to the Kingston church records, and  was born at Rosendaal, daughter of Tacob and  Lea (Nienwkcrk') Rutsz. The baptism of  three of their children are recorded at Kings-  ton. Albert, April 7. 1745; Lea, April 12,  1747; Jacob. December 31, 1749. It is prob-  able that their parents removed about this time  to a remote section of Ulster county, or to  Orange county.   (V) Isaac Abrahamsc. son of Abraham and     Elizabeth (Rutsz) Roosa, was a soldier in the  revolutionary army. He first was a private  in the Albany Company Militia, Second Regi-  ment; he was commissioned September 20,  I775> <is ensign in the Tenth Company of  Mamakating Precinct, under Captain John  Creag and Colonel James McClaughrey. He  was appointed first lieutenant, November 4,  1778, in the Hanover Precinct Company, un-  der Captain William Simrall.   (\T) John, son of Isaac Abrahamse Roosa,  was born in Orange county, New York. He  was buried in Bethel. Sullivan county, New  York. He married Dolly Duryea.   (VII) Dr. Isaac Roosa, son of John and  Dolly (Duryea) Roosa, was born 1792, died  at Bethany, Wayne county, Pennsylvania, in  1837. He was a very eminent and successful  physician and surgeon and rode on horseback  through a wide region surrounding Bethany  in the care of his patients. I le married Mary  Kellogg.   (VIII) John I^ercival, son of Dr. Isaac and  Mary (Kellogg) Roosa, was born November  8, 1823, in Bethany, Pennsylvania, died July  5, 1902. He was deprived of a liberal educa-  tion by the death of his father when he was  less than fourteen years old. It had been his  father's hope to give him a college training.  When fifteen years of age he went to Bethel,  Sullivan county. New York, to reside with an  uncle, Charles B. Roosa, and was employed as  a clerk in the latter's store. Being intelligent  and active he became thoroughly familiar with  the mercantile business, and in 1853 he opened  a store at White Lake, New York, where he  continued in business several years. Later he  operated a store at Bethel, New Y'ork. which  he conducted for a period of twelve years,  and then turned it over to his son, Charles B.  After spending one year at Walton, New  York, he removed to Monticello, Sullivan  county, where he lived retired from active  business. He married Hannah J., daughter  of Moses and Elizabeth (Mitchell) Calkin, of  Cochecton, New York, where her grandfather  built his first house of hewed pine logs in  1787. Moses Calkin was born 1785, died  February 12, 1865. Children of John P.  Roosa and wife: i. Mary Elizabeth, born  September 17, 1847; married Rev. E. B.  Wells, a Presbyterian clergyman, and lived in  Chase, Kansas ; they had no children, but  reared an adopted daughter Anna, who be-      >       ^.X'^     i     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     came the wife of Henry Kerr, and resided in  Oklahoma, having three daughters. 2.

John Percival, mentioned below. The mother  of these children now resides in the home at  Monticello which was purchased by her hus-  band thirty-six years ago.   (IX) Isaac Percival, son of John Percival  (i) and Hannah (Calkin) Roosa, was born  January 28, 1854, in Bethel, New York, where  he spent a part of his youth, and where he  acquired the elementary parts of his education.  He attended the Monticello Academy and  graduated from Cornell University in 1S74.  He was for several years in the foreign freight  department of the Pennsylvania railroad at  New York, and in 1886 was appointed deputy  United States despatch agent in New York  City. He became despatch agent, October 31,  1890.   (IX) John Percival (2). youngest child of  John Percival (i) and Hannah (Calkin)  Roosa, was born January 6, 1S62, in Bethel,  New York, where he spent his boyhood and  was wont to make himself useful about his  father's store. Early in life he conceived the  idea of taking up the profession of law and  began his studies with Judge Bush at Monti-  cello. In order to prepare himself thoroughly  for his life's work he entered Princeton Col-  lege, and later graduated from Columbia Law  School, New York. In 1884 he was admitted  to the bar and immediately took up the prac-  tice of his profession in IMonticello, where he  had a distinguished career as a pleader and  jurist. In 1889 he was elected special county  judge, and in 1895 was elected district attor-  ney, succeeding himself by re-election in 1898.  In 1905 he was elected county judge and sur-  rogate and was subsequently considered as a  candidate for judge of the third judicial dis-     trict to succeed the late Judge Fitts. Al-  ways taking a keen interest in the prog-  ress of his home and state, he became  actively interested in politics and was made  chairman of the Republican county com-  mittee in 1891, continuing in this capacity for  several years. In 1904 he was an alternate  delegate to the Philadelphia convention which  nominated William McKinley for president  and was a regular delegate to the Chicago  convention which nominated Theodore Roose-  velt. He participated in many congressional  district conventions and was always recog-  nized as a leader in the councils of his party.  Being much interested in historical matters  Judge Roosa became an early member of the  Holland Society of New York, and was iden-  tified with several societies. He was a mem-  ber of the State Bar Association of New  York, serving as a member of its admission  committee, and was also a member of the  Princeton Club of New York. He was an  associate member of the Hook and Ladder  Firemen of Monticello, president of the Vil-  lage Improvement Society, and trustee of the  Sullivan County Society for the Prevention  of Cruelty to Animals. He served as a mem-  ber of the board of education, and was two  terms village president. A man of sympa-  thetic nature, generous in judgment and purse,  loyal to his friends, cool and judicious in  business judgment and a gentleman at all  times, he was very popular among all classes  of people in his home town. He died at his  home in Monticello, February 22, 1910, and  his untimely death was regretted by the entire  community. For some years his health had  been failing, but he bravely struggled against  physical weakness, continuing his practice un-  til a short time before his death.   He married, June 25, 1890, Caroline, daugh-  ter of John P. and Mary Jones, and great-  granddaughter of John P. Jones, founder of  the village of Monticello.     The family name is said to  SEABURY have been originally Sed-   borough, and to have be-  longed to a Somersetshire family, which  though not conspicuous in English history  appears to have been of good standing'.  Weaver, in his 'Visitations of Somerset',  gives four generations of this family. They  are associated with Porlock, Frome, and other     I     206     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     parts of that county. A hamlet of the name  of Seaborough is on the southerly border of  Somerset, near to Devon and Dorset, and a  surname of this form appears in 1667. Bol-  ton, in his 'History of the Church in West-  chester County' ('New York, 1855, pp. 79,  80). in an account of the family affirms its  identity with that of Scdborough, and gives  its arms as: Argent a fcsse engraillcs betiveen  three ibexes passant sable. In E. de Ver-  mont's 'America Heraldica' these arms are  depicted, and included among those of fam-  ilies settled in this country before 1789. They  are in use in various branches of the Seabury  family.   The name appears in the western world,  first in 1638, in the records of an English  company chartered for the settlement and  plantation of Providence Lsland in the West  Indies, and soon after, in 163Q, in New Eng-  land. The name has in its history had per-  haps more than the usual variations in spell-  ing : Seabery, Saberry, Sebery, Sibery, Sea-  bree, Sebree, Sedbery and Seaburry, are actual  instances of variation.   (I) John Seabury and Grace, his wife, ap-  pear in Boston in 1630. he having, according  to the town records, with leave bought a house  and small plat of land there, and being in  November of that year 'Allowed for an In-  habitant.' He is described in that record as  a '.Seaman.' . In the church record of the  admission of his wife Grace to membership.  May 15, 1642, he is described as a planter.  He is supposed to have been the person who  under the same name was a resident in the  Providence Plantation in 1638, and who, be-  ing dissatisfied with his treatment by the local  authorities, although he was sustained by the  government and company resident in England,  departed from that island. It is notable that  the John Seabury. of Boston, appears there  within a year from the departure from Provi-  dence Island, and that after residing in Bo.ston  a few years he went to the West Indies with  his wife Grace, residing in Barbadoes until  his death about 1659.   During his residence in Boston, the town  records show the birth of Samuel, son of John  and Grace Seabury, December to, 1640. 'The  baptiMii of this Samuel is shown by the church  records to have been on the 22nd of May,  1642, where he is described as 'being about a  ycare & half old.' It appears from records     of a suit brought by this Samuel Seabury,  in 1662, in relation to the Boston property,  that his father had before that date died in  Barbadoes, and had left beside Samuel, an-  other son, John, and daughters. No subse-  quent record of John or his sisters in Barba-  does has appeared. All the known descend-  ants of John and Grace Seabury, of Boston,  in 1639, trace through their son Samuel,  above-mentioned.   (II) Dr. Samuel Seabury, son of John Sea-  bury, according to Winsor, came from Bostofi  and settled in Duxbury, Massachusetts, before  1660. He was a physician and surgeon, and  a man eminent and influential in the early  history of that town, where he spent the re-  mainder of his life, dying August 5, 1681, in  his forty-first year. His name was written  Seabury, Seaberry and also Saberry ; and his  will was signed 'Sanuiel Saberrey.' In the  family descriptions he is called, in distinction  from other Samuels, Dr. Samuel Seabury, of  Duxbury. He married (first) November 9,  1660, Patience, daughter of William and Eliz-  abeth (Partridge) Kemp; children: Samuel,  born April 20, 1666; John, born in 1674; also  of this marriage there were several daughters,  the only one of whom to marry was Hannah,  wife of John Partridge, through whom many  of the name of Partridge trace to Dr. Samuel  -Seabury. He married (second) April 4, 1677,  Martha, daughter of William Pabodic and his  wife. Elizabeth Alden, daughter of John and  Priscilla (Mullins) Alden. Children: Jos-  eph, born June 8. 1678 ; Martha, September  23, 1679, married Joseph Sawyer, through  whom many descendants of that name trace  to Dr. Samuel Seabury.   It appears from the foregoing that the  name of Seabury, after the time of Dr. Sam-  uel Seabury, is carried on in three main lines  of descent from him. After a brief general  account of each of the heads of those three  lines, will be given, more in detail the de-  scendants of John, the head of the second of  the three main lines.   (Ill) Dr. Samuel (2) Seabury, the fifth of  the name counting from John the emigrant,  and the third child of Dr. Samuel (i) and  Patience (Kemp) Seabury, was born in Dux-  bury, Massachusetts, April 20, 1666. He lived  in that place somewhat more than the first  half of his nearly a century of life. His fa-,  ther's will gave him the surgical books and     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     207     instruments which he had used as a doctor,  and also gave to him his landed property in  Duxbury. He made extensive additions to  this, acquiring land in other parts of Massa-  chusetts and in Connecticut. In 1695 ^l^  deeded to his brother John the property, some  eighty acres, at the Brick Kilns, which was  part of the inheritance from his father. Dur-  ing his residence in Duxbury he was often  engaged as agent of the town ; represented it  in the general court of the colony, and served  as town treasurer. Winsor notes his having  succeeded to his father's position as physician,  and speaks of him as a prominent man in the  town as treasurer and representative, and also  as a prominent member of the church, and an  ensign in militia. In 1727, being then at the  end of his sixty-first year, he sold his farm in  Duxbury, and removed to North Yarmouth,  Maine, where he resided until his death, No-  vember 10, 1763, in the ninety-eighth year of  his age. He was prominent in that place  throughout his residence, and acquired a large  landed property there. He acted as moderator  in the formal re-organization of the settle-  ment as a town in 1733. and previous to that,  in 1730, was the first of eight inhabitants who  under their pastor, Ammi R. Cutter, organ-  ized a Congregational church there, of which  congregation he was deacon and elder. He  is commonly spoken of for this reason as  Elder Samuel Seabury. He married (first)  in his twenty-third year, December 13, 1688,  Abigail Allen, who died March 31, 1733; he  married (second) in his seventy-third year,   September 27, 1738, Margaret • , widow of   Stephen Larrabee, who died May 18, 1754,  there being no issue by this second marriage.  By the first marriage he had twelve children,  of whom five lived to maturity and left issue,  viz.: Benjamin, Samuel, Barnabas, Abigail,  Patience. The daughter, Abigail, was mar-  ried to her cousin, David Seabury, son of  John, of the third generation, of which mar-  riage there have been many Seabury descend-  ants ; and the daughter. Patience, was mar-  ried to Dr. Gilbert Winslow, whence came  many Winslow descendants from the Seabury  stock. The sons, Benjamin, Samuel and  Barnabas, have many descendants ; those of  Benjamin in Connecticut, New York and else-  where; those of Samuel at Duxbury, and  those of Barnabas (who removed with his  father to North Yarmouth) in Maine. It is     to be observed that this Maine branch, in  whatever states its members may since have  settled, is the oldest branch of the family,  since they are descended from the oldest son  of Dr. Samuel Seabury. The number of those  descendants is very greatly increased by the  marriage of Elder Samuel Seabury's daughter  Abigail to David, son of John Seabury, as  above noted. These, however, though de-  scended from the oldest son of Dr. Samuel,  are so descended through a female line, and  their line of descent from David Seabury  properly classifies them as belonging to that  younger branch of the family which derives  from Dr. Samuel's second son, John.   (Ill) Lieutenant Joseph Seabury, the  eleventh of the name counting from John  the emigrant, and the youngest son of  Dr. Samuel (i), though the first child of  second marriage with Martha Pabodie,  was born June 8, 1678, and is known as  Lieutenant Joseph Seabury. He settled in  Tiverton, Rhode Island, where he built a  house which has remained in the hands of  several generations after him. His descend-  ants are very numerous in Rhode Island, Mas-  sachusetts and elsewhere. Many of them have  been eminent, and the care of some of them  for the preservation of the family history has  been very noticeable. A good deal of the  family lore has come from the records of Tiv-  erton and Little Compton, the home places of  the Rhode Island branch. Lieutenant Joseph  Seabury died August 22, 1755. and was buried  at Little Compton. He married (first), Sep-  tember 25, 1 701, Phoebe Smith, born in 1679.  died April 21, 1715, widow of John Smith and  daughter of Lieutenant William Fobes and  Elizabeth Southworth, his wife. Children :  Samuel, born June 5, 1702; Martha, February  7, 1704; Joseph, December 2. 1705; Benjamin.  January 20, 1708; Sion, March 27, 1713;  Mary, April 17, 1715. He married (second)  Mary Ladd, born in 1699, died in 1734. daugh-  ter of William and Elizabeth (Tompkins)  Ladd. Children: Phoebe, born March 2, 1723-  24; Hannah, February 7, 1724-25; Gideon,  May 16, 1726; John, November 26. 1727;  Elizabeth, February 2, 1729; Sarah, Decem-  ber 4, 1732; Ichabod. January 18, 1734.   With what now immediately follows, about  the other brother, John, is shown the earliest  known history of the family and indicates its  three main divisions, derived respectively from     208     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     the first, second and third sons of Dr. Samuel  Seabiiry, of Duxbury, Massachusetts.   (Ill) Deacon John Seabury, the tenth of  tliat name counting from John the emigrant  and the eighth child of Dr. Samuel and  Patience (Kemp) Seabury, was born at Dux-  bury, Massachusetts, in 1674. He received  by the deed of gift previously mentioned, from  h'is brother Samuel, very probably as an equit-  table share of the father's estate devised to  the eldest son, the house of his father and  some eighty acres in Duxbury, in 1695, which  was the year of his attaining his majority. On  December 9, 1696, he married Elizabeth,  daughter of David and Mary (Southworth)  Alden, the said David being the son of John  and Priscilla (Mullins) Alden. It is to be  noted that this is the second connection of  Seabury and Alden. The descendants of Dr.  Samuel Seabury, through his younger son.  Tohn, trace to John Alden through his grand-  daughter, Elizabeth, and Dr. Samuel Seabury 's  descendants through his youngest son, Joseph,  trace to John Alden through his daughter,  Elizabeth, whose daughter (Martha Pabodie)  was Dr. Samuel Seabury 's second wife.   John Seabury removed froin Duxbury to  Stonington, Connecticut, and thence to Gro-  ton. opposite New London, in the same state.  Here he spent the remainder of his life well  established both in civil and religious associa-  tions. He is frequently mentioned in various  concerns by Hempstead in his diary. He was  a deacon in the Congregational Society in  Groton. and is commonly spoken of as Deacon  John Seabury. His death took place while he  was on a visit to his son. Rev. Samuel Sea-  bury, M. A., rector of St. George's Church.  Hempstead, December 17, 1759, in the eighty-  sixth year of his age, as his tombstone in the  churchyard there records.   The children of Deacon John and Elizabeth  (Alden) Seabury were: David, born January  16. 1699; John, January i, 1700. died in in-  fancy; Patience, May 5. 1702: John, May 22.  1704; Samuel, see forward; Mary, November  II, 1708; Sarah, March 16, 1710-11; Na-  thaniel, July 31, 1720. Two of the daughters  of this family. Patience and Mary, married  and had children. Of Sarah, the third daugh-  ter, appears no record. Patience married  three times, (first) Joseph Latham; (second)  Renj.nmin Starr; (third) Francis Griswold.  and is said to have issue by each marriage.     Mary married Jonathan Starr, and from that  marriage there are very many Seabury de-  scendants in the Starr family. Four sons of  Deacon John Seabury married and had issue.  David, as before noted, married his cousin,  Abigail Seabury, of the Maine line, and there  are many who trace through him to Deacon  John, second son of Dr. Samuel Seabury,  and through her to Elder Samuel, first son  of Dr. Samuel Seabury. John, son of Deacon  John, resided in Groton, and died in 1744.  Hempstead speaks of him as an iim-holder,  and of his father, by way of distinction, as  'Deacon Seabury' and 'Old Mr. Seabury.'  He also mentions his marriage to Esther,  daughter of Captain James Rogers and widow  of Benjamin Shepley. Three children of this  marriage have not been traced. Nathaniel, the  youngest son of Deacon John Seabury, mar-  ried Michal, and left two sons, Nathaniel   and David, the latter of whom is of illustrious  memory, as having been one of the devoted  garrison of Fort Griswold, all of whom were  treacherously slaughtered by the British under  Benedict Arnold, and wliose name is engraved  on the column there erected. He married  Elizabeth Chester, and many of his descend-  ants are traceable to the present time. The  fourth son and fifth child of Deacon John and  Elizabeth (Alden) Seabury, with whose line  this notice is especially concerned was Sam-  uel Seabury.   (IV) Rev. Samuel (3) Seabury, son of  Deacon John and Elizabeth (Alden) Seabury,  was born at Groton, Connecticut, July 8, I70(5,  died at Hempstead, June 15, 1764. He received  his education partly at Yale College and partly  at Harvard, whence he graduated in 1724,  receiving later the degree of M. A. from Yale.  To distinguish him from other Samuels and  otlier clericals, he is called Rev. Samuel Sea-  bury, M. A. He was for a few years a Con-  gregational minister, serving in Maine and in  Connecticut, but conforming to the Church  of England, received Episcopal ordination in  1730 in London, England, from the bishop  of that see. Returning to this country as a  missionary of the English Society for Propa-  gating the Gospel, he was one of the founders  and the first rector of the Church of St.  James, in New London, Connecticut, which  position he held up to the time of his being  made rector of St. George's Church. Hemp-  stead, in 1742. He removed thither about     SOUTHERN' NEW YORK     209     1743, and held that position until he died. Dur-  injj his residence in New London, and later in  Hempstead, he was assiduous in missionary  work in surrounding places, and thus became  the founder of several additional parishes, both  in Connecticut and in New York. He served  regularly while living in Hempstead two other  parishes at distances involving a forty-mile  ride on horseback for the services held in a  day. He went also on invitation into Dutchess  county, where he held the first church of Eng-  land services, and organized Trinity Church,  Fishkill. New York. He was a man of  extraordinary energy and faithfulness, and  added to his pastoral labors by the practice of  medicine and the teaching of a school which  he kept in his own house. His only publica-  tions were a sermon, preached in England, and  a pamphlet written in defense of attacks made  upon him for encroaching upon the neighbor-  hood of ministers not of the Church of Eng-  land.   He married (first), about 1727, Abigail  Mumford, born September 3, 1710, died in  1731, daughter of Thomas and Hannah (Rem-  ington) Mumford; by whom: Caleb, born  February 27, 1728; Samuel, see forward. He  married (second) Elizabeth Powell, who sur-  vived him, and their children were five sons  and three daughters. The sons, of whom Dr.  Adam Seabury was the eldest, remained for  the most part in Hempstead and have a worthy  and respected posterity ; of the daughters, one,  Elizabeth, married Dr. Benjamin Tredwell,  and another, Abigail, married Gilbert Van  Wyck. Both the Tredwell and Van Wyck de-  scendants are very numerous, and through  their marriages include many other names scat-  tered throughout the United States and Can-  ada. Of the sons of the first wife, Caleb, the  elder, the name of whose wife is unknown,  is said to have left two sons. Caleb and John.  Nothing is known of the son Caleb ; but the  son John was a man of character and position,  who resided in \'ermont. and served in the war  of 181 2 with the rank of colonel. He mar-  ried Mary . and afterwards Dorothy Har-  ris, and his progeny is fully set forth in the  book of Harris Genealogy by N. H. Harris.   (V) Bishop Samuel (4) Seabury, son of  Rev. Samuel (3) and Abigail (Mumford)  Seabury, was born at Groton, Connecticut,  November 30, 1729, died in New London.  Connecticut, February 25, 1796. His boyhood     was spent with his father in the place of his  nativity, as well as in New London and  Hempstead, whence he entered Yale College,  graduating in 1748. He afterwards received  from that college the degree of M. A., and  later (1777) from the University of Oxford  the degree of Doctor of Divinity. He studied  medicine at the University of Edinburgh,  Scotland, in 1751 or 1752, and in 1753 was  ordained in London both deacon and priest.  Returning as missionary of the Society for  Propagation of the Gospel, he had charge for  a year or so of the church in New Brunswick,  New Jersey, and in 1757 was collated by Gov-  ernor Sir Charles Hardy to the rectorate of  Grace Church, Jamaica. New York, and in  1766, by mandate of Governor Sir Henry  Moore, was inducted rector of .St. Peter's,  Westchester, New York, and there resided and  officiated until the troubles of the revolution  caused the discontinuance of his ministrations  in that place. Adhering to the legitimate gov-  ernment, which he regarded as essential to  the preservation of the church, he was con-  spicuously involved in controversies with the  revolutionary party from the time of his first  charge in New Brunswick until he was kid-  napped from his parsonage in Westchester by  a band of patriots under Captain Sears, in  November, • 1775, by whom he was taken on  horseback to New Haven, where he was im-  prisoned for about six weeks, until released  on demand of the president of the provincial  congress in New York and allowed to return  home. The animosity against him was par-  ticularly intensified by his authorship of what  are known as the Farmer Pamphlets, from his  signature of A. W. Farmer. His continued  molestation made his residence at home im-  possible, and he went within the British lines  in New York. Here he resided during the  war. serving as chaplain of the King's .Amer-  ican Regiment by commission of Sir Henry  Clinton, officiating as missionary at St. An-  drew's Church, on Staten Island, and for the  better support of his family practicing med-  icine in the city. At the close of the war he  was elected. March 25. 1783, by the Church  of England clergy in Connecticut as bishop  of the church in that state, and in June fol-  lowing sailed for England, seeking consecra-  tion. The English bishops, though opposing  no personal objection to the applicant, did  not feel themselves free, on account of their     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     state connection, to consecrate him, and he  sought and obtained, November 14, 1784, con-  secration at the hands of three bishops of  the Scottish church, who were of the same  Episcopal lineage as the English, but whose  connection with the state had long been sev-  ered. He returned to Connecticut in 1785; he  resided in New London and discharged the  duties of the Episcopate and of the rectorate  of St. James's Cluirch for about eleven years,  until his death. In 1790 the church of Rhode  Island also came under his jurisdiction. He  was the first bishop of settled jurisdiction in  the United States. Two others were conse-  crated in England, in 1787, and one in 1790,  and he united with these three in the con-  secration, in 1792, of Claggett, of Maryland,  through whom every subsequent American  bishop of their Communion traces. He was  the first president of the House of Bishops of  the Protestant Episcopal Church, and im-  pressed upon the Liturgy of that church its  most distinguished characteristic. His bones  repose beneath an altar tomb in the Church  of St. James, and there are many memorials of  him, both there and elsewhere in the United  States, as also in Scotland and in England.  His published works are numerous, but apart  from controversial papers, mostly sermons.  Two volumes of these were published before  his death, and one, prepared by him for the  press, afterwards. A life of him was pub-  lished by Rev. Dr. E. E. Beardsley, in 1881,  and a Memoir of him, in 1908, by Rev. Dr. W.  J. Seabury.   Bishop Samuel Seabury married. October  12, 1756, Mary, daughter of Edward and  X'ioletta TRicketts) Hicks, of Staten Lsland.  New York. Their children were: Violetta  Ricketts, Abigail Mumford, Mary, Samuel.  Edward. Charles, sec forward. All of these,  except Mary, were married, and the two mar-  ried daughters left children ; but none of the  sons had issue, excepting the youngest son,  Charles, therefore all the descendants of the  bishop trace through him if of the name of  Seabury.   (VI) Rev. Charles Seabury, son of Bishop  Samuel (4) and Marv (Hicks) Seabury, was  born at Westchester, New York, May 29, 1770,  died at Setauket, Long Island, December 29!  1844- He went to New London when his  father settled there in 1785; studied under  tutors, and was ordained deacon by his father.     in 1793, and priest, by Bishop Provoost, of  New York, in 1799. He officiated some time  at Grace Church, Jamaica, Long Island, suc-  ceeded his father as rector of St. James, and  so remained until 1814, when he became rec-  tor of Caroline Church, at Setauket, Long  Island. New York. Here he resided until his  death, having charge also of the churches at  Huntington and at Islip. He was eminently  the faithful pastor and his works were in the  hearts of his people. He was, as his father had  been, a member of the Masonic Order. He  married (first) June 13, 1799, Anne, daughter  of Rosewell and Elizabeth (Stewart) Salton-  stall, of New London. He married (second)  Elizabeth (Handy) Moscrop, widow of Rev.  Henry Moscrop. Of this second marriage  there was no issue; the children of the first  marriage were five sons, and one daughter,  who died in infancy. Of the five sons, two  died unmarried, and the other three. Samuel,  Charles Saltonstall and Richard Francis, mar-  ried and left issue. Charles Saltonstall Seabury  married Ruth Hawkins Mount ; lived at Stony  Brook. Long Island, and left three sons and  three daughters. His only male descendant  bearing the name at present is Edward  Scratchley Seabury. son of Thomas Shepard  Seabury, second son of Charles Saltonstall  Seabury. Richard Francis Seabury married  (first) Lydia Maria Russell, and (second)  Catherine Eliza Russell, and had three sons by  the second marriage, Charles, Richard and  Samuel, and several daughters, all settled in  Illinois. Of these, Charles had one son,  Charles \\'ard Seabury, and Samuel had two  sons, Edward F. and William Samuel. This  line is therefore continued in the eldest son  of Rev. Charles Seabury.   (VII) Rev. Samuel (5) Seabury, son of  Rev. Charles and Anne (Saltonstall) Seabury,  was born at New London, Cotinecticut, June  9, 1801, died in New York City. October 10,  1872. His boyhood was spent in New London  until in his fourteenth year he went with his  father to Setauket, Long Island. He had scant  facilities, but with an unquenchable thirst for  learning, acquired it in large measure, and  early began to teach others, starting for him-  self when about twenty years old a school for  boys in Brooklyn. He was ordained by Bishop  Hobart. of New York, deacon, in 1826, and  priest, in 1827. He had several pastorates on  Long Island, and was professor in St. Paul's     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     College, at Flushing. About 1833 he became  editor of the Neiv York Churchman, making it  a distinguished leader in church journalism  until about 1850.

This family is of Welsh origin  DAVIES and was first known under the  name of Davies in 1581, when  Robert ap David of Gwysany assumed it, and  received confirmation of the family arms and  grant of crest and motto. From the best in-  formation that can be obtained, it appears that  John Davies, the immigrant, was the only son  of Thomas Davies, fourth son of Robert  Davies of Gwysany Castle, in the jiarish of  Mold, Flintshire, England. The family for  years has ranked among the first of Xorth  Whales. They derived an unbroken descent  from the famed Cymric Efell, Lord of Eylwys  Eyle, who lived A. D. 1200, son of Madoc ap  Meredith, Prince of Powys Fadoc, sixth in  descent from Merwyn, King of Powys, third  son of Rodic Maur.   (I) John Davies, the immigrant ancestor,  was born in England, in Kingston parish in  1680, and came to America in 1735 with his  wife, Catherine Spenser. He settled in the  western part of Litchfield county, Connecticut,  and purchased one hundred and sixty acres of  land from Thomas Lee for one hundred and  fiiiv pounds, within the present town of Wash-  ington. W'ithin fifteen years after his arrival  he was owner of a large and valuable tract  containing nearly a thousand acres of the besf  land in Litchfield county. In religion he was  Episcopalian, being one of the founders of the  Episcopal church at Litchfield. On April 4.  1747, he conveyed to Mr. Samuel Cole, as trus-  tee for the church, a tract of fifty-two acres  of land in Litchfield, to be held for the use and  benefit of the minister of the church. At his  request the church was named .St. Michael's,  and the first service held April 23, 1749. In  1747 Mr. Davies gave to his son a tract of four  hundred and thirty acres, and in 1750 he gave     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     213     to his grandsons, John, Thomas and William,  one hundred and twenty acres of land. His  wife died several years before he did, but the  exact dates are unknown. He had only one  child, John.   (H) John (2), son of John (i) Davies,  was born in England, in 171 1, died May 19,  1797, aged eighty-six years. He was educated  at the University of Oxford, and in 1734 mar-  ried Elizabeth Brown, who died about 1739.  He married (second) in England. 1744, Mary  Powell, who died December 15, 1801, aged  seventy-five years. He made two or more  voyages to America before he finally settled  here in 1747 on the land given him by his  father. As a member of the Episcopal society  in Litchfield he was influential. Like his  father, he did not appear to have much interest  in taking part in public atTairs. During the  French and Indian war, 1757, he purchased a  large tract of land in Saratoga county, New  York, and went there to take possession, but  was kept from his purpose by hostile Lidians,  and returned to Connecticut in 1758. He and  his family were Tories, and the property of  his sons John and \\'illiam was confiscated,  and John was fined and imprisoned for a year  in Litchfield jail for giving aid to the royal  cause. His young son David narrowly escaped  death for the same reason, but was pardoned  on enlisting in the continental army during  the war, it is written, although his name does  not appear on the war rolls. After the sepa-  ration of Birch Plains of 'Davies Hollow'  from the township, the family withdrew from  the church and built one principally at their  own expense near their homes. Children, by  first wife, born in England: John, mentioned  below; Thomas, born January 2, 1737; Will-  iam, born 1739, died in infancy. Children, by  second wife, born in England : William, born  January 29, 1744; Mary, March 17, 1745, died  young; James, 1746, died in infancy; Walter,  June 22, 1747. Born in America: Catherine,  born July 20, 175 1 ; Elizabeth, July 3, 1753;  .•\nn, November 18, 1755 ; James John, Decem-  ber 31, 1757; David, March 14, 1759; Rachel,  .\ugust 20. 1761 : George, February 12, 1764:  Thomas. May 30, 1766.   (IH) John (3), son of John (2) Davies,  was born at Kingston, county of Hereford,  England, June. 1735, and was brought to  America by his father when young. In 1750  his grandfather conveyed to him a tract of     land, and in 1758 his father gave him sixty  acres. During the revolution he was im-  prisoned for aiding England's cause, as well  as being deprived of his property. He was  active in the organization of the Church of  St. John, founded by his father. In 1793 or  1794 he opened a store in the town of Wash-  ington, in partnership with his son Thomas  John. They also purchased cattle in the coun-  try which they sold in New York. This enter-  prise was successful until the summer of 1798,  when there was an epidemic of yellow fever in  New York, and the cattle drove sent there  was an entire loss to him. This last blow  seems to have discouraged him, and he died  April 18, 1799, aged sixty-four. He married,  in 1763, Eunice Hotchkiss, of New Haven,  who died March 29, 1824, aged seventy-nine.  Children : Elizabeth, Thomas John, Eunice,  Esther, all born before 1774.   (IV') Thomas John, son of John (3) Davies,  was born at Davies Hollow, November, 1767.  He lived near his father. As the rest of the  family had been, he was an Episcopalian, and  in August, 1796, he was elected chorister. In  1798 he met with reverses in business and  determined to start again on the shore of  Black Lake, St. Lawrence county. New York.  In 1800 he removed his family there and made  a home in the wilderness. Soon many families  were settled near, and Mr. Davies always had  a leading part in the community. In politics  he was a Democrat and for ten years held the  office of sherifif of St. Lawrence county, and  served for several years as county judge. Two  sons, Charles and Thomas, he sent to the  United States Military Academy at West  Point. He died April 18, 1845, aged seventy-  eight, and was buried on his own grounds at  Black Lake. He married, December 29, 1792,  Ruth Foote, daughter of Captain John Foote,  of \\'atertown, Connecticut, who died Septem-  ber 21, 1852. Children: Belvidcre, wife of  Cieorge Ranney ; John Foote, Charles, Henry  E., mentioned below; Thomas Alfred, and  Eunice Ruth.   iV) Henry Ebenezer, son of Thomas John  Davies. was born at Black Lake, February 8,  1805. At the age of fourteen he entered the  family of the late Judge Alfred Conkling, at  Canandaigua, to prepare for the profession of  the law. On becoming of age he was admitted  to the bar in Albany county, April, 1826. He  began his professional career in Buffalo, theo     214   a small village on the western frontier. His  first important case was between the owners  of uplands who wished to extend warehouses  into the river and shut oiif ancient rights of  wav and by the aid of old residents, includmg  the Seneca Chief, Red Jacket, establishing the  fact that the right of way had existed from  time immemorial, Mr. Davies won his case and  his victory resulted in his election in the fol-  lowing year as city attorney. In the winter of  1S29-30 he removed to New York City and  soon afterward formed a partnership with his  uncle. Samuel A. Foote, and the firm contin-  ued until 1848. when Mr. Foote retired.  .■\mong the clients of the firm were various  large corporations, including the Erie Rail-  road Company. Mr. Davies next entered into  partnership with Hon. William Kent, and the  firm lasted until 1853. His next partner was  Henry ]. Scudder, son-in-law of Prof. Charles  Davies.' When Mr. Davies was elected a ju.s-  tice of the supreme court in 1855, James C.  Carter, who had been a clerk of the firm, was  admitted to partnership and the firm became  Scudder & Carter.   Mr. Davies was always a Whig in politics  and was an able public speaker and cam-  paigner. In 1840 he was elected assistant  alderman of the City of New York from the  Fifteenth Ward and in 1842 was chosen an  alderman. At this time, he was chairman of  the committee in charge of celebrating the in-  troduction of Croton water in the city. In  1850 he was appointed corporation counsel,  and he held the office for three years. One of  the most important services he rendered in this  office was in successfully defending Mayor  Cornelius W. Lawrence in suits for damages  caused by the blowing up of buildings to  check a conflagration, upon order of the  mayor. After he retired from this office he  made, at the request of the common council,  a compilation of the statutes relating to the  city with its ancient and modern charters. In  the summer of 1855, he accompanied abroad  Millard Fillmore, former President of the  United States, whose friendship he had  formed in early life, continuing until his death.  In the same year he was elected to the bench  of the supreme court. During his term of  office he presided at two celebrated murder  trials, those of Cancemi and Burdcll. and in  the general term concurred in the decision  that slaves brought into the state became free.     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     In the fall of 1859 he was elected justice of  the court of appeals for eight years, during the  last two of which he was chief justice. He  wrote the opinions of the court in many most  important cases, such as that of Kortright vs.  Cady (21 N. Y. 343). establishing the point  that tender of the amount due on a mortgage  destroys the lien thereof : People vs. The  Canal Appraisers (33 N. Y. 461 1, establishing  the law relating to navigable streams ; Dealfield  vs. Parish (25 N. Y. 9'), discussing the mat-  ter of testamentary capacity. Probably no  opinion ever caused him more thought and  study than that written in Metropolitan Bank  vs. Van Dyck (27 N. Y. 400), sustaining the  legal tender acts of the nation. He gave to  the government unfaltering support during the  civil war, and his conviction that the consti-  tution conferred extraordinary powers on the  government in time of war found expression  in his opinions, especially in the legal tender  case. At the end of his term, he declined re-  election and resumed his practice in partner-  ship with Judge Noah Davis until the latter  was re-elected to the bench in 1872. and after-  ward with his son, Julian Tappan Davies. He  was counsel for the Mutual Life Insurance  Company and other large corporations, but de-  voted himself mainly to chamber practice and  to service as referee in important cases. The  day before he was stricken with his last illness  he sat for many hours as one of the commis-  sioners to determine the feasibility of con-  structing the Broadway Arcade Railroad. He  was a director of the Institution for the In-  struction of the Deaf and Dumb, and during  the last year of his life its president. In 1870  he became dean of the Law School of the Uni-  versity of the City of New York and contin-  ued in this ofifice as long as he lived. He re-  ceived the honorary degree of LL. D. from  the university and also from Amherst Col-  lege.   'Judge Davies was conspicuous.' wrote his  son, Henry Eugene Davies, in the Davies gene-  alogy, 'during his long and busy life for sterl-  ing integrity and devotion to the interests  committed to his charge. His capacity for  labor was prodigious and sustained by a con-  stitution of iron that gave him enormous  powers of endurance. During the Cancemi  trial, after five days spent until a late hour in  presiding, at half-past seven on a Fridav even-  ing he commenced to write his charge. He fin-     SOUTHERX NEW YORK     ished it as he was summoned to breakfast at  eight o'clock the next morning, having labored  all the night without intermission for sleep  or refreshment. From this, and from other  similar herculean labors, he never suffered any  inconvenience or felt that he had sustained a  strain, until some two years before his death,  when age slowly claimed him as its own. Yet  he retained great vigor until the day when he  was fatally attacked, some two weeks only  tefore his death. ***!,., person he was  strongly and heavily built, Jhough of medium  •stature. He possessed the powerful body  with large organs and short limbs, character-  istics of his Welsh ancestry. His head was  large, with a brain fully developed, and a  countenance full of benignity, though stern in  such times as called for an exhibition of  •strength. He was genial in manner and  friendly with all men. His sole pleasure was  the professional one of whist. Temperate in-  •deed, almost abstemious in his habits, simple  in his tastes, earnest in his professional duties,  the two leading motives of his life were devo-  tion to duty and love of his family. True  to the church of his ancestry, and following  their lead, he gave to St. Luke's Church at  Matteawan, in Dutchess county, the land upon  which its edifice is erected. Under the shadow  ■of its eaves he rests — wife, children and grand-  children reposing around him. The memory  of his pure, strong, loving spirit is the most  precious heritage of his living descendants.''  He died in the city of New York, December  17, 1881.   He married Rebecca Waldo Tappan, born  in Boston, 181 5, died February 24, 1884,  daughter of John and Sarah (Salisbury) Tap-  pan.

He attended the schools  of his native city and the private school of Dr.  Reed at Walnut Hill, Geneva, New York. He  entered Columbia College in 1862 and was  graduated in the class of 1866. In the sum-  mer of 1863, while a student in college, he  joined the Twenty-second Regiment of New  York State Militia, and took an active part in  the Pennsylvania campaign of the Civil War,  ending at the Battle of Gettysburg. On leav-  ing college he devoted himself to the study of  law in the office of Hon. Alexander W. Brad-  ford. Under the will of Judge Bradford, Mr.  Davies succeeded to part of his law practice,  and soon afterward became associated with  his father. Judge Davies, who retired from the  bench of the Court of Appeals, January i,  1868. With these fortunate connections he  established an active and prosperous profes-  sional career and gained a deservedly high,  reputation as one of the leading lawyers of  New York City. In politics he is a Repub-  lican. In religion a member of the Episcopal  church. He has been for many years counsel  for the elevated railways of New York ; has  been since i88i a trustee of the Mutual Life  Insurance Company of New York. His office  is at 34 Nassau street. New York. He is nov,-     2l6     SOUTHKRX NRW YORK     n partner in the firm of Davies, Auerbach,  Cornell & Barry.   He married, April 22, 1869, Alice, born Jan-  uary 12, 1847, daughter of Hon. Henry H.  Martin, a descendant of Captain John Mar-  tin, of Woodbur)', Connecticut. Children:  lulicn Townsend, born February 20, 1870;  Alice, died in 1885. aged fourteen; Helen, died  in 1877, aged five; Thoma,s Alfred, died in  1877, aged four; Ethel, born March 19, 1876;  Frederick Martin, born September 12, 1877;  Cornelia Sherman, born October 21, 1882.     The surname Brinck-  BRINCKFRHOFF erhofif is Dutch in   origin, and is com-  posed of the two Dutch words, 'Brenger,'  messenger, and 'Hof,' court, the name in  its original meaning referring to a 'messenger  of the court.' The name therefore in the  land of its origin may be found in the form  of Brengerhof, as well as in the form prev-  alent here in America. The family is said  to be of Flemish extraction, and was anciently  located in the city of Ghent, in the Nether-  lands, wliere its members are mentioned as  free-born citizens, or patricians, of the city,  and among whom Andries Brinckerhoff, sen-  ator and syndic in 1307, is particularly noticed  in the annals of those times. From Ghent the  family extended itself in the sixteenth century  in Holland. Friesland and Lower Saxony, in  which provinces the Brinckerhoft's became  established, their descendants enjoying much  distinction there at the present day. The name  is spelled in America Brinckerhoff and P.rin-  kcrhoff. and in some manuscripts written  Blinkerhoff, in one instance Van Blyncherhoff.  The Flushing branch of the family (descend-  ants of .Abraham, son of Joris Dircksen Brinc-  kerhoff, the immigrant) for the most part use  the 'c'. The Bergen branch (descendants of  Hendrick. son of Joris Dircksen Brinckerhoff )  have almost entirely omitted it. .'\mong the  families of the name residing in Holland the  'c' has never been known, and probably it is  an .American innovation. The family has a  coat-of-arms, the symbolic meaning of which  is thus described by James Riker: The  armorial bearings, the original escutcheon of  the family, denotes in the color blue, fidelity ;  in the white of the shield, the honors of  •knighthood: the wings sigrnifying promptness  in state affairs, and the 'flower hills' in the  knights shield faithfulness and honesty. The     family has a numerous progeny in every gen-  eration, differing in that respect from fam-  ilies like that of Stuyvesant, which in the first  four generations was represented by a single  male member. Branches of the family have  spread into different states, even to the far  West, though the bulk of its members are  still in the neighborhood of New York. All  of the name in America are said to be de-  scended from one patriarchal ancestor, the  immigrant, Joris Dircksen Brinckerhoff, of  New Amsterdam. and Brooklyn.   (I) Joris Dircksen Brinckerhoff, the first  American ancestor of the Brinckerhoff family,  was born in the Netherlands about 1609, died  in Brooklyn, January 16, 1661. He arrived  in New Amsterdam (now New York) in 1638,  coming from the county of Drent or Drenthe  in the United Provinces, and having lived  some time in Flushing, a seaport in Zealand,  before his departure. After spending a short  time in New Amsterdam, then a small com-  munity of a few hundred souls, he settled in  Brooklyn, where he obtained a grant of land  by brief dated March 23, 1646.

Morris, is  MORRLS usually given as being Welsh   in origin, and though it is quite  likelv that many or most hearing the name  of Morris may have had an origin in the  ancient principality of the Britons, it is certain  that the name in other cases has had a dif-  ferent origin. In the case of those of Welsh     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     219     descent, the name is traced back to Rhys,  sometimes called Rhys Fitzgerald, brother of  Rhys, Prince of Geventland. In 1171, in con-  junction with Richard Strongbow, the Nor-  man, Rhys Fitzgerald, or Rhys, the son of  Gerald, led an expedition into Ireland. This  was the beginning of what is called in history  the 'Norman Invasion' of Ireland, occurring  more than a century after the Norman Con-  quest of England. The real conquest of Ire-  land did not occur until the reign of Henry  VIII., four centuries later, the Normans who  had until that time entered Ireland having  intermarried with the Gaelic or Milesian Irish  and settled in the country with the Gaelic  as Milesian lords of clans. There were, how-  ever, several encounters between the incoming  Norman Welsh and the Milesian Gaels in  several of the principalities of the island, and  owing to his achievements in these engage-  ments Rhys received the appelation of 'Maur'  ir Welsh or Brithonic Celtic, and 'Mor' in  Gaelic Celtic, both kindred words meaning  'The Great.' Rhys, The Great, thus became  Maur-Rhys or Mor-Rhys, and in course of  time his descendants prefixing the name with  Fitz, Mac, and O, to indicate their descent  according to the Celtic fashion, and later  '' dropping the prefixes, were at first called Fitz  iMr.urice, AlacMaurice, and O'Maurice. and  later simply Maurice, Morris and Morrison.  These, however, are not the only forms of  Morris, for the name is found in historv vari-  ously spelled Morys, Moerys, Moris, Morris.  Morice, Moryce. etc., and as compounded with  \arious initial expressions as De Mont-, Clan-,  and others besides those given above. Lower  says that the name can in many cases be traced  to an origin on the continent or mainland of  Europe, in many cases coming from the north  of Africa, and particularly Morocco. Burke,  in his 'History of the Landed Gentry of  England,' says: 'This name (Morris),  originally Maur-ryce or Mawr-rhys was  changed to Maurice, Morrice and Morris,  Mars and Mavors. The Welsh Mawr-rwyce  — meaning in English 'warlike' or 'power-  ful' — was a title applied to such of the ancient  chieftains as were prominent for valor.' The  name Morris is common in Ireland and is in  most cases the anglicized patronymic of a fam-  ilv of purely Milesian origin, the ancient form  of the name in Gaelic being MacMuiros or  O'Muirfeasa, later transformed in English to     Morrisey, Morris, Morishy, MacMorris, Mor-  rison. Donoch, brother of Diarmuid, who is  No. Ill on the MacDermott (Princes of Cool-  avin, a title still borne by The MacDermott)  pedigree, v\'as the ancestor of this Morris fam-  ily.   ( I ) \\ illiam Morris lived in the first half  of the seventeenth century in Monmouthshire,  Wales, on an estate called Tintern, situated  near the historic Tintern Abbey. Children: i.  Colonel Lewis, inherited Tintern estate ; was  second in command of the parliamentary  troops at the seige of Chepstowe Castle in  1648, and in memory of his achievements at  that time the present crest and motto were  added to the family arms ; he removed to Bar-  bados and later to New York City. 2. Will-  iam, inherited property in Denham, Wales ;  was a parliamentary officer under Cromwell ;  died at sea. 3. Thomas. 4. Richard, mentioned  below.   (II) Captain Richard Morris, son of Will-  iam Morris, of Tintern, was born in Mon-  mouthshire, Wales, died in 'Bronck's land'  (Bronx) near New York City, in the autumn  of 1672. He served with distinction in the  parliamentary army under Cromwell. He fol-  lowed his brother Lewis to the Barbados, and  after a short stay there removed to New  York City, where August 10, 1670, he pur-  chased from Samuel Edsall 'a certain tract  or parcel of land formerly in the tenure of  Jonas Bronck's, commonly called by the In-  dians by the name of Ranackque, and by the  English Bronck's land, lying and being in the  maine lothe east and over against Harlem  town.' He married, in the Barbados, Sarah  Pole, who died about the same time as her  husband.   (HI) Hon. Lewis Morris, son of Captain  Richard and Sarah (Pole) Morris, was born  in 'Bronx-land,' New York, October 15,  1 67 1, died at his country seat, Kingsbury,  near Trenton, New Jersey, May 21, 1746.

In 1697 he procured from Governor Fletcher  a royal patent erecting 'Bronxland' into a  manor under the title of the 'manor of Mor-  risania.' and as such it continued until the  revolution. He was first lord of the manor,  and became one of the most distinguished and  influential men of his times in America, hold-  ing among other high offices those of chief     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     justice of New York and governor of New  Jersey. He married. November 3, 1691, Isa-  bella, daughter of Hon.

Alletta Nathalie, born  April 2, 1912.     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     There are two well-known fam-  TAPPAN ilies of long American descent   bearing this name, which is  also used in the form of Tappen. The prob-  ability is that both names have a Dutch origin.  It has been claimed by members of the Mas-  sachusetts family that the surname was origi-  nally written Topham, or De Topham, and  was assumed from a place of that name in  Yorkshire, England. The family of Topham  anciently possessed the greater part, it is said,  of the vale of Coverdale, in Yorkshire, and  Richard Topham, from whom there has been  a continual male succession, held the lordship  and property of Caldburgh, in Coverdale. dur-  ing the time of Henry V., 1420. The earliest  mention of the family in the registry of the  archbishop of York is found in the will of  John Topham, of Yorkshire, dated May i,  1403. In England, it has been claimed, the  name is spelled Tophan, Topham, Toppan and  Tappan ; while in America the three spellings  Tappan. Tappen and Toppan are in common  use. Of this a writer says : 'It is, however,  more probable that the English family of Tap-  pan was brought by the family from the  Netherlands rather than that it changed the  Saxon patronymic of Topham into Tappan.  No other branch of the Tophams is known  to have made such an alteration, and it is  difficult to conceive of an English family dis-  carding or modifying their own name to  'Dutchify' it.' The name of all the Tappans.  Tappcns and Toppans is therefore very likely  Dutch in origin. To complicate the problem  still further, there was in the New Netherland  a Elemish family from Luxembourg, which  spelled its name Tapin, Tappin or Tappen, and  pronounced it Tappan. and in later years one  of the offshoots spelled it to conform with the  pronunciation. 'The Massachusetts race has  been pre-eminent for intellectuality, philan-  thropy and practical Christianity; the Luxem-  bourg for professional attainments ; while the  Knickerbocker stock has gained renown by its  sturdy, manhood, its high character, public  spirit and mental attainments.'   It seems probable that a number of the  Tappans crossed over from the Netherlands  to England during the religious troubles of  the seventeenth century, and that those who  came here through Great Britain, and the  others who came direct from Holland were re-  lated. From the time of Henry VIII. to     Charles I. there was a small but constant  migration of Hollanders into England. They  belonged mostly to the artisan class, and had a  considerable reputation as builders and weav-  ers. The New York Tappans were at any rate  artisans of great ability. In the old records  they are referred to as weavers, glazemakers,  shipsmiths and builders. The family came to  New York or New Amsterdam about 1630,  and after remaining a brief time in Manhat-  tan went to Fort Orange, where it settled and  remained for many years. It then broke  asunder, the main line removing to Kingston,  where it became distinguished in matters of  the state and nation. The junior line remained  in the neighborhood of Albany, and sent out  some of its meinbers to the west, so that the  family is now prominent in many states.   (I) Jurian Teunisse Tappan, glasemaecker,  the immigrant ancestor of the Tappan and  Tappen family of New York, was born in  Holland about 1600. died at Albany, New-  York, in 1677. -^ tradition of the family says  that he came here from Wales. Jurian T. Tap-  pan when he came to this country about the  year 1630 must have brought considerable  property with him from the old world, as he  appears to have been in easy circumstances,  if not affluence, from the first. He was pop-  ular with the people and on terms of %varm  friendship with the patroons and leading mer-  chants. A devout member of the Dutch church,  during the inclement winters he devoted a cer-  tain niunber of his hours every week to visit-  ing and caring for the sick poor. The same  kindly spirit actuated him in his dealings with  the Indians, who called him 'The Good  Chief.' From 1654 to 1677 '^^ ^'^^P'^ '^'^ '''•  In the latter part of his life he seems to  have operated largely in real estate, buying,  selling and exchanging village lots and farms  upon a scale indicating the possession of  large means. In 1670 he exchanged a house  and lot in Albany for the farm of Cornells  Cornclise Viele at Schenectady, which he sold  in 1672. In 1671 he took title to a bouwery  between Wynant's and Poesten Kills, which he  sold the next year for six hundred beaver skins.  He married a daughter of Wybrecht Jacobse,  and they made a joint will in 1661. At that  time they had no children living. Children:  Tunis, mentioned below : Jurian.   (II) Tunis, son of Jurian Teunisse Tap-  pan, was born at Albany, New ^'nrk, about     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     22J     1635, and appears to have died before 1661.  He probably had sons, Tunis and Christopher.  The Tunis Tappan who settled in Kingston  and there married, in 1695, Sarah Schepmoes,  was undoubtedly a grandson of Jurian Teu-  nisse Tappan, of Albany. Schoonmaker's  'History of Kingston' states that he was the  son of Jurian and the father of Christopher.  The Kingston church records give a very full  account of the family of Tunis Tappan, of  that town, who married Sarah Schepmoes, in  1695. They had children, baptized at Kings-  ton from 1696 to 1707, but there is no Chris-  topher among them, and the Christopher of  the next generation was born long before the  marriage of Tunis Tappan and Sarah Schep-  moes. He was presumably a brother of Tunis,  of Kingston.   (HI) Christopher, said to have been a son  of Tunis Tappan, is said by the family rec-  ords to have been born at Albany in 1661.  He settled at Esopus, where he died August  7, 1740. It is said that he had brothers, Tunis  and Peter. He married, at Esopus, recorded in  Kingston, April 21, 1715, Cornelia Vas, born  in Holland, daughter of Dominie \^as. Only  one child is recorded in the Kingston church  records, Petrus, mentioned below.   (IV) Peter (Petrus), son of Christopher  and Cornelia (Vas) Tappan, was baptized at  Kingston, January 29. 171 6, and resided in  Esopus. He married (recorded in Kingston),  July 2, 1736, Tjatje Wynkoop, the family says,  daughter of Cornelius Wynkoop. The latter  has numerous children recorded at Kingston,  but no daughter of this name. There were  numerous other Wynkoops in Kingston, but  none had a daughter of this name recorded.  She may have been born and baptized at Eso-  pus, but this is improbable, as nearly all the  Esopus people were recorded in Kingston at  that time. Children : Christoffel. baptized 1737,  died young: Peter, 1738, died young: Corne-  lia. 1740, died young; Christoffel, mentioned  below; Cornelia, baptized November 25, 1744:  Petrus. June 24, 1748. Cornelia became the  wife of Governor George Clinton. Peter (Pet-  rus), who was a physician, was first lieutenant  in Captain John Schenck's company, Dutchess  county militia, under Colonel Jacobus Swart-  wald, February 19, 1776, and was surgeon of  the hospital department from 1776 to T780.   (V) Christopher (Christoffel), third son of  Peter (Petrus) and Tjatje (Wynkoop) Tap-     pan, born at Esopus, baptized June 17, 1742,  in Kingston, died at Kingston, August 3, 1826.  He was a member of the New York provincial  congress from 1775 to 1777. He was a man  of marked ability, became prominent in early  life, and during a long career held many of-  fices of honor and importance. Chief among  these was membership in the first, third and  fourth provincial congresses, where he took  strong ground in favor of colonial liberty and  independence. He was a trustee of Kingston,,  being chairman of the board, a magistrate and  president of the board of magistrates. From  1759 to 1812 he was deputy county clerk, and  clerk from 1812 to 1821. His home was de-  stroyed on the burning of Kingston by the  British during the revolutionary war. At this  juncture he displayed a gallantry and patriot-  ism worthy of notice. When the attack be-  gan it was evident that there was no hope of  a successful resistance, and there was barely  enough time for its citizens to save the private  property. Christopher had before him the  alternative of preserving either the public rec-  ords or his own personal belongings, includ-  ing family heirlooms, deeds, and other evi-  dences of wealth. He did not hesitate, but  took his own horses and wagons to the court  house and removed the public records to safe-  ty, leaving his home to the torch of the foe.  Aiter the evacuation he rebuilt the family  home, constructing it with stone and brick,  and making it as nearly fireproof as the re-  sources of that century would permit. Here  he kept open house, as had been the habit of  his father and mother. The mansion was the  favorite resting place of Governor George  Clinton, who was Christopher's brother-in-  law, as well as of the state and national  leaders. In the time of the revolution he was  major of Colonel Charles De Witt's regiment.  Ulster county. New York, minute-men, enter-  ing it December 21, 1775. He married. May  9, 1761. Anatje, daughter of Tobyas and Lea  (Leg) Wynkoop, baptized November 11, 1744,  at Kingston. Children, baptized at Kingston:  Petrus (Peter), mentioned below: John, bap-  tized 1766; Cornelia, March 6. 1770; George,  April 13, 1772; Catharina and Anatje, twins,  August 28, 1774, (the first died in infancy) :  Catharina, December 8. 1776: Christopher,  January i, 1784. John, born 1766, died April  30, 183 1. He received a good education and  studied law, being finally admitted to the bar.     224     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     He did not, however, follow the profession his  father had mapped out for him, but took to  literature and journalism. He began to con-  tribute to the press even before he attained  his majority, entered journalism and became  a popular and influential editor. Hi.s best  remembered work was done while he was  editor and proprietor of the Plebeian, which  afterwards became the Ulster Gazette. The  paper was anti-Federalist and throuojh its ei)i-  grammatic and art^umentative force exerted a  great influence upon the political arena in the  early part of the nineteenth century. The  family records also note a daughter Polly.  horn 1762, and another daughter, died in in-  fancy, born 1763.   (VI') Peter (2'), eldest son of Christopher  and Anatje (Wynkoop) Tappan, was bap-  tized November 4, 1764, at Kingston. He  entered the military service when about six-  teen years old, on the staff of his uncle, Ma-  ior-General and Governor George Clinton. .\\.  the age of seventeen, on August 21, 17S1, he  was commissioned a second lieutenant in the  second regiment of the continental artillery,  commanded by Colonel John Lamb, in which  regiment he served with the continental armv  until the end of the war. He settled in New  York City, where he died in i<S46 and was  buried in the vault belonging to the family of  his daughter-in-law, wife of Henry P. Tapnan  (who was a Livingston), in the churchyard of  the old First Presbyterian Church at Fifth  avenue and Twelfth street. On account of  the anger of the mob during the Draft Riots  of July, iRfi^, against the family friends, Ar-  thur and Lewis Tappan, Abolitionists, and  against all persons of the name, living or dead,  the coffin was taken from the vault after mid-  night and conveyed secretly to Greenwood  cemetery where it was deposited in the Tap-  pan plot. The name plate was removed from  the coffin and has recently been placed in the  same plot. He married, at Kingston, Febru-  arv- if., 17R6. .Ann De Witt, baptized Novem-  ber i,S, 1764. at Kingston, daughter of Colonel  Charles and Rlnndina (Du liois) De Witt.  Children, baptized at Kings'ton : Blandina,  June 24. 1787; Anna Maria, January 2, 1789:  Cliristopher Peter (not recorded at Kinp-s-  •on); Cornelia, October 4. 170.S: Charles De  Witt. June 24, 1708; Sarah Du'Bois, January  II, 1801; Ilcnrv Philip. July 27, 180s. Two  of the sons. Cb,^rI(^^ Do Witt and Henry     Philip, were clergj'men, the former born May  25, 1798, and the latter April 16, 1805.   (VII) Christopher Peter, eldest son of  Peter (2) and Ann (De Witt) Tappan, was  born September 20, 1791. in Kingston. He  removed with his father to New York, resid-  ing in the latter part of his life in Brooklyn,  where he died January 6. 1877. He married,  March 17, 1814, Mary Hurd. Children: Har-  riet, .A.nn, Maria, De ^^'itt, Sarah, Kate, Mary,  Christopher.   (\TII) Dr. De Witt Tappan. son of Chris-  topher Peter and Mary (Hurd) Tappan. was  born July 16, 1822, in the city of New York.  After attending Professor Anthon's school in  old New York, he joined the class of 1844 at  Yale University. After one year at that in-  stitution, he returned to New York and later  graduated at the College of Physicians and  Surgeons, now the medical department of  Columbia University. He engaged in the  practice of medicine for a few years only, in  New York and on Long Island, and died at  Dosoris in the town of Oyster Bay, August  10, 1887. He married, April 21, 1851, Mar-  garet, daughter of John Butler (z) and Eliza  Townsend (Coles) Coles, of Dosoris, Long  Island.   (IX) John Butler Coles, son of Dr. De  Witt and Margaret (Coles) Tappan, was born  April 4, i860, at Dosoris, where he grew up  and attended the local schools. In 1876 he  entered Yale University, from >j-hich he was  graduated in 1880, and in the latter year be-  came a student at the Columbia University  Law School, of New York City, graduating  in 1882. In the latter year he was admitted  to the bar and has since been continually en-  gaged in the practice of law in New York  and Long Island, having an office on Wall  street. New York, being now head of the legal  firm of Tappan & Bennett. Mr. Tappan is a  man of strong individuality and has taken an  interest in public matters, uniformly from the  point of view of the individual citizen, and  not as an office-seeker or office-holder. He  has become allied with various organizations,  in whose work and principles he feels an in-  terest. He is a member of the .Association of  the Bar of the City of New York, the New  York State Bar Association, New York Coun-  ty Lawyers' Association. Nassau County Bar  Association, American Bar Association. In-  ternational Law .Association of London,     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     American Economic Association, American  Scenic and Historic Preservation Society,  American Society of International Law.  American Society for Judicial Settlement of  International Disputes, Board of International  Hospitality, Civil Service Reform Association,  Navy League of the United States, New York  Peace Society, Sons of the Revolution, and  other kindred bodies. Among the clubs with  which he holds affiliation may be mentioned  the Yale, Nassau Country, Reform, Republi-  can, Sewanhaka Corinthian Yacht, Whitehall,  City Graduate Club of New Haven, Psi Upsi-  lon. Glenwood Country, Hempstead Harbor,  Huntington Country, Economic of New York.  Piping Rock Racing Association. He was one  of the founders of the National Progressive  party and represented that party on the New  York electoral ticket in the presidential cam-  paign of 1912. He resides during part of the  year near Glen Cove, in the town of Oyster  Bay, and during the remainder of the year in  the city of New York. He married. May 21,  1885, Caroline A., daughter of James and  Caroline (Valentine) Titus, of Glen Cove.     Coldwell and Caldwell are  COLDWELL different forms of the same   surname. 'The name Cald-  well,' says a writer, bearing the patronymic,  'is a pleasant treasure ; for there is a tradition  yet told in England and Scotland that a little  company, centuries ago, discovered a well of  remarkable coldness. They pitched their tents  and later took up a continuous abode near it.  They were ever after called Cold-wells or, as  it has since been evolved, the Caldwells'. The  Patronymica Brittanica asserts that the name  means 'cold well', and says that the name is  derived from localities in various counties in  England bearing it. Another writer suggests  that Caldwell is a synonym of wisdom and  authority ; as the word Cold-wold in the Scot-  tish dialect of English was the Hazel-wood  cr the divinity rod, which hung for a long  time in Bavarian court rooms as a symbol of  authority and justice. The baton of officers  and the schoolmasters' rods were of hazel in  olden times.   The Caldwells appear in England in the  reign of William the Conqueror; they were  prominent in later centuries in Ayrshire, Scot-  land, and their names are recorded as borne  by immigrants from England, Ireland and     Scotland, in the early days of New England's  story. In the Domesday Book of England  what would appear to be the same name is  spelled Caldeuuelle. The name has been com-  mon for centuries in England, Ireland, Scot-  land and France, though of course few of the  families bearing it have any connection with  each other. Thus many of the Caldwells of  Ireland and Scotland were originally Mac-  Cawells, the Gaelic form of the name being  Mac Cathmhaoill, from Cathmhaoill, ninth in  descent from Farach. brother of the monarch,  Murtogh Mor, son of Earca, who is ninetieth  on the stem of the House of Heremon. Many  of the Caldwells or Coldwells of Britain and  Ireland have the right to bear arms. The  Coldwells or Caldwells here dealt with, as far  as their origin can be traced, appear to be of  Yorkshire stock, England, this line finding its  way to America only in the nineteenth century.  (I) Jonathan Coldwell or Caldwell, the im-  mediate progenitor in England of the family  here dealt with, was born at Staleybridge,  Yorkshire. England, about the year 1790, and  died at the same place. He probably was en-  gaged to some extent in farming, but the evi-  dence points to the probability that he was  engaged by regular occupation in the iron  trade. He married, probably about 1812, but  the maiden name of the wife remains unre-  corded. Children : John, mentioned below ;  Jephtha, Abel, Joseph.   (II) John Coldwell, eldest son of Jonathan  Coldwell or Caldwell, was born at Staley-  bridge, Yorkshire, England, about 1814, died  at Matteawan. New York. He was by occu-  pation a grinder, and was engaged in the iron  trade. He came to America in 1841 with his  family and settled in Matteawan, New York,  where he was engaged by Mr. Rothery as a  file grinder. He continued in this sort of work  for a number of years, but finally left it to  engage in the grocery business, in which he  continued until his death. He and his wife  were buried in the Methodist cemetery of  Matteawan, New York. He married, about  1837, at Staleybridge, Yorkshire, England,  Hannah, daughter of a Mr. Ardron, who  lived in the same neighborhood. Children:  Thomas, mentioned below ; Samuel ; John ;  Joseph; Sarah, married William W'arwick;  Ellen, married John Myers ; Anne, married  James Terwilliger.   (Ill) Thomas, eldest son of John and Han-     226     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     nah (Ardron) Coldvvell, was born at Staley-  bridge, Yorkshire, England, September 28.  1838, died at Newburg. New York. July 28.  1905. He became one of the pioneers m  America among manufacturers in one impor-  tant line of industry. He was so essentially  American and was so long engaged in useful  labor on this side of the sea that no one ever  took him as being foreign born. 'I am gen-  erally taken for an American', he once said,  'and a Yankee at that. My mother came  from an old Lancashire family of farmers,  and owned a small estate in that county,  which had been in the family from the time  of Cromwell. My father's family were of  humbler origin and belonged to Lancashire.  They were somewhat noted for their genius  and love of liberty, several useful inventions  having emanated from members of his fam-  ily. Their love of liberty, and what they  considered the oppression of the English laws,  led them to emigrate to America in 1841. and  no more enthusiastic and loyal citizen ever  claimed .America as his home than my father'.  Thomas Coldwell was only three years old  when he arrived in America in company with  his parents in 1841. As soon as he was old  enough to learn anything he was put to work.  The family having settled at Matteawan, New  York, he found employment in the cotton fac-  tory there when he was eight years old at a  dollar a week. At the age of eleven he was  placed with John Rothery, a file-maker, to  learn the trade of file cutting. He was with  him for several years, but did not like the  business and begged his father to put him  where he could learn to be a machinist. He  worked with his father at grinding for three  years, and then, as his father was leaving the  business, he was bound apprentice for three  years 'to learn the art, trade and mystery of  file forging'. He stayed at the file business  only two years and for three years after  assisted his father, who had gone into the  grocery business, by clerking for him. In  1861 he took a contract from the Washington  Iron Works of Newburg to grind and finish  the brass work for use on gun carriages.  About the time the gun carriage contract work  was finished this company took a large con-  tract for building freight cars and he secured  a job in the car works, running a lathe, and  turning car axles. This was his first real  work as a machinist, and he bent every energy     to make the most of his opportunity, and was  so far successful that in six weeks he had  entire charge of all the wheel and axle work,  and a few weeks later took all the work by  contract.   About that time he made a file cutting ma-  chine, which was his first real invention of  any kind. He interested the Eagle File Com-  pany of Middletown in it, and they purchased  a one-half interest for $500.00. But the cut-  ting machine was not a great success, but it  led him to invent a file stripping machine,  which was a great success, and on which he  took out his first patent. In 1865 he returned  to his old home at Matteawan, New York,  and later entered the employ of H. N. Swift,  and while with him he made the only lawn  mowers made in this country. The idea of  making a lawn mower was suggested to him  by Henry Winthrop Sargent, of Fishkill-on-  the-Hudson, who owned an English mower  which Swift had often repaired for him.  Thomas Coldwell made many improvements  in tools for Swift and among other things  invented the revolving cutter grinder, which  is now used in every lawn mower factory in  the country. He had a fellow workman named  George L. Chadbom, and between the two  of them they made a lawn mower and named  it 'Excelsior'. They interested L. M. Smith  and Charles J. Lawson, hardware men of  Newburg, New York, in their new machine  and they formed a copartnership with them.  They made but one size machine, sold for  thirty dollars, and in 1870 they organized the  Chadborn and Coldwell Manufacturing Com-  pany, with a capital of $4,000.00. Thomas  Coldwell was the president, and he held that  position for over twenty years, in fact, until  he left the company. The first year they  made over three hundred mowers, and the  following year about one thousand. About  this time they bought out Swift's lawn mower  business as well as several other businesses in  the same line that had not prospered. In 1876  Mr. Coldwell went to Europe to introduce the  company's mowers. His trip was very suc-  cessful and he placed the company's mowers  with a large firm having houses in both Lon-  don and Paris, and four years later they estab-  lished their own house in London and Mr.  Coldwell spent the 'lawn mower season' in  Europe pushing the trade. The principal  event in connection with the English business     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     was the international trial of lawn mowers  held at Liverpool in iS86, which Mr. Coldwell  attended. At this exhibition twenty-two dif-  ferent makes of lawn mowers were entered,  principally from the United States and Eng-  land. Mr. Coldwell worked both the horse  and hand mowers at the trial, the result of  which was that he carried off both first premi-  ums. 'I felt', he says, 'that it was the proud-  est day of my life when I cabled the result  to the factory and friends at home'.   In 1891 he sold out his interest in the Chad-  born and Coldwell Manufacturing Company  as he had a desire to have a business he could  control, and he also wished to introduce some  new inventions in lawn mowers and also some  improved machinery for manufacturing the  same. He therefore at once organized the  Coldwell Lawn Mower Company. They built  a new plant, and stocked it with the best tools  and machinery. The panic of 1893 affected  the new company, but in the following year  they had great success which continued in the  years that followed, during which the plant  had to be repeatedly enlarged. They could  finally turn out twelve hundred hand mowers  a day besides a large number of horse and  motor mowers. They also had a large foreign  trade and exported mowers to nearly every  civilized nation in the world.   Thomas Coldwell married, in i860, Jose-  phine Terwilliger, of Stormville, New York,  born June 27, 1837, and now living at New-  burg, New York. Children: William H.,  mentioned below ; Jennie, married E. C. Ross :  Harrv T., mentioned below.   (IV) William H., eldest son of Thomas  and Josephine (Terwilliger) Coldwell. was  born May 6, 1863, at Stormville, Dutchess  county. New York. He attended the Academy  at Newburg and Eastman's Business College  at Poughkeepsie. On completion of his  studies he organized the Coldwell Wilcox  Manufacturing Company of Newburg, of  which he is now the vice-president. In i8qi  he became representative in Europe for the  Coldwell Lawn Mower Company which he  and his father had newly organized. In 1897  they bought out the Chadborn and Coldwell  Manufacturing Company, a transaction which  considerably extended their business. \\'illiam  H. has held all the offices within the gift of  the corporation, having gone through the dif-  ferent grades, finally becoming president on     the death of his father. He is the inventor  of the motor lawn mower, now in use the  world over. He is a member of the Republi-  can Club of New York, the Hardware Club,  the City Club, the Powellton, the Elks' Club,  and also belongs to the Masonic order. He  has been alderman at large several years and  has also been supervisor of the fourth ward  for a like number of years. He has been alms  house commissioner and is now park commis-  sioner in the city of Newburg. He married,  at Newburg, December 24, 1885, Emma C,  daughter of Henry T. and Mary E. (Chap-  man) Pierce, of Newburg. Children: Theo-  dora, born at Newburg, New York, in 1887;  Kenneth Pierce, born at Newburg, New York,  in April, 1889.   (IV) Harry T., son of Thomas and Jose-  phine (Terwilliger) Coldwell, was born at  Newburg, New York, January 15, 1876. He  was educated at the Academy at Newburg,  and was also for two years at St. Giles' School,  London, England. He did not, however, fin-  ish his schooling in England for on his return  he entered the Sigler Preparatory School at  Newburg. On leaving school he entered the  Coldwell Lawn Mower Company, of which  he has since held all the offices, with the ex-  ception of that of president, and is now secre-  tary and director. He is a member of the  Masonic order and a Shriner, member of the  City Club of Newburg, of the Friars' Club,  New York, and of the Newburg Yacht Club.  He is president of the Stonybrook Real Estate  Improvement Company, was alderman of the  fourth ward, Newburg. an office which he  filled for two terms. He married. June 29,  1898, Mary A., daughter of William Holt, of  Lancashire county, England. There has been  one son of the marriage, Thomas, born at  Newburg, New York.     The surname Crawford ap-  CRAWFORD pears to be of Scottish ori-  gin, and has been derived  by one authority from a parish of the same  name in Lanarkshire, Scotland, and several  other places in North Britain. This may have  been the origin of the name as borne by fam-  ilies of Anglo-Saxon or Norman descent on  the paternal side. In some cases, however,  the family name of Crawford, which is known  in the three kingdoms of England, Ireland and  .Scotland, almost equally well, is the transla-     228     SOUTHERN' NEW YORK     tion or transmutation of a name that was  purely Gaelic, but which for convenience had  to take an EngHsh form, as the more modern  displaced the more ancient tongue of Eire and  Alba. In a great many cases the name appears  to have been derived from the family of Sir  Roger de Craufurd, a knight from Normandy,  who was the sheriff of Ayrshire in 1291, and  who himself seems to have been the common  ancestor of many of the branches of the fam-  ilv bearing the name to which he belonged.  The name in its Norman form was anciently  written Craufuird. There is another tradition  to the effect that the first bearer of the name  was one Mackornock, who signalized himself  at an engagement by 'water of Cree in Gallo-  way, by discovering of a Foord, which gave  a signal advantage to his party'. Hence he  got the name of Cree-Foord or Craufurd.  According to Burke's 'Work on tieraldry'  there are something like twenty-one families  in the British Tsles bearing this name, who  have tlie right to bear arms. One of these  shields is described heraldically : Quarterly,  1st and 4th, gu. a fesse erm. in base two  swords saltireways ppr. hilted and pommeled  or., a bordure wavy ar. 2nd and 3rd, sa. three  lions heads erased or.

(I) Quintan Crawford, the immigrant an-  cestor of the Crawford family here under  consideration, was born in Edinburgh, Scot-  land, 1675, died at New Castle, Westchester  county. New York, 1748. He was a manu-  facturer of woolen goods and materials of a  similar kind. He emigrated to .Vmerica in  the early part of 1701 and landed in New  Amsterdam, purchasing a large farm in New  Castle, which in those days was known as  North Castle, and there settled. He married,  in the early part of the year 1717, Dorothy  McDonald. Children : John, see forward :  Feli.x, Uriah, Israel, Tamathy.   (II) John, eldest son of Quintan and Doro-  thy (McDonald) Crawford, was born about  1693, probably died in New Castle. He mar-  ried and had a number of children, among  them being .Samuel.   (III) Samuel, son of John Crawford, was  known as 'The Patriot', and was born at  White Plains, New York, October 12, 1736.  When he had grown to manhood he purchased  a farm of ninety-six acres located on the west     side of the town of Scarsdale, adjoining the  farm of Jonathan Griffin Tompkins, border-  ing on the Bronx river and what is now known  as Hartsdale. This he made his permanent  residence. In the spring of 1775, when the  country was all aflame against the outrages  of Cireat Britain he, with James Varian, or-  ganized a company of soldiers from among  the young men living in the towns of White  Plains and Scarsdale. and on February 14,  1775, he was elected lieutenant of said com-  pany which was attached to and formed a part  of Colonel Joseph Drake's regiment of minute-  men. He was deputy from ^^^estchester coun-  ty to the provincial congress for the years  1775-76-77. In May, 1775, he was a commit-  teeman from the town of Scarsdale for the  purposes of the war of the revolution. When  the news reached White Plains from Phila-  delphia, declaring independence from the  mother country, the state convention was in  session. It was moved that the colony of  New York be a free and independent state,  which resolution was seconded by Samuel  Crawford (birth of state of New York). On  November 18, 1777, he, with a detachment of  his company, was surprised by a detachment  of British soldiers near Stephen Ward's tav-  ern, which was located at the forks of the  Albany post road and the road to Tuckahoe  depot to town of East Chester, now known as  Gifford's Park. .Samuel Crawford and sev-  eral others were killed and thrown into a hole  in the ground opposite this tavern without a  shroud or coffin. (An account of this burial  can be found in the National Magazine of the  year 1853).   Samuel Crawford married, in Tarrytown,  New York, January 29, 1759, Jane Requa.

After being graduated from the Lockswood  Military Academy in 1859, he entered the     230     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     store of A. Rankin & Company, No. 96 Broad-  way, dealers in Scotch woolens and hosiery.  In 1862 he engaged in the fire and life insur-  ance business with his father, under the title  of E. Crawford & Son. On October 19. 1864,  he was elected secretary of the Westchester  Fire Insurance Company, which position he  held until January 10, 1879. when he was  elected to the presidency, an office he has filled  very capably up to the present time (1913)-  On May 16, 1861, with a number of other  young men, he organized the Union Hook  and Ladder Company of White Plains, New  York. December 10, 1867, he was elected a  member of the Clinton Hook and Ladder  Company, No. i, of Mount Vernon, New  York. March 4, 1869, he was elected assist-  ant foreman of said company, and in 1870 was  chosen as foreman, and on April 20, 1877, he  was elected chief of the Mount Vernon Fire  Department. October 16, 1905, he was ap-  pointed fire commissioner of the city of Mount  Vernon, New York. He was initiated a mem-  ber of Huguenot Lodge.

It has  been described as Saxon, Nor-  man-French, Welsh and Irish in origin, and  the truth seems to be that the name has really  at least two dififering origins. It appears as  the family name of the Earls of Lincoln in  England ; but it is well known also in Ireland  and Scotland, in those two countries it is as-  serted to have a purely Gaelic origin. Lower,  the British authority on surnames, says of it :  'The Duke of Newcastle derives from Rcin-  baldus, who came hither at the Conquest, and  assumed his stirname, Glimpton (anciently  written Clinton), county Oxford, part of the  possessions granted to him for his services.'  The name is known in Ireland and Scotland  under the forms Clinton. Mac Clinton and Mac  Clinlain ; and in these cases is said to be a  contraction of the Gaelic terms Mac-giolla-  Finton. Mac stands for 'son ;' giolla means  'votary' or 'devoted ;' and Finton stands for  'St. Fintain.' The meaning of the terms  Mac-gioUa-Finton. therefore, is 'the son of  the votary of St. Finton.' This, it is claimed,  has been contracted into the form IMacCIinton,  just as Malcolm is a contraction of the terms  mac-maoil-Colum. meaning the 'son of the  votary of St. Columba.' It was the custom  in the old days throughout Gaeldom to take  a saint's name with 'Giolla' or 'Maoil,' both  having the same meaning of votarv or de-  votee, prefixed to it as a mark of respect.  These names subsist to the present day, in  every case considerably modernized, however,  in the way of contraction. Still another form  of Clinton is found in the patronvmic 'De  Clinton.' which seems to argue a different and  a Norman origin. It is difficidt to distinguish  the origin of each of these names in a par-  ticular case, but the Clintons, whose first  American ancestor came from Ireland, are de-  clared to have belonged to the same family as     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     231     the British Earls of Lincohi, a member of  the family having apparently settled in Ire-  land some generations previous to the sailing  of the first American ancestor with his family  to America.   ( I ) Charles Clinton, immigrant ancestor of  the Clinton family, was born in county Long-  ford. Ireland, in 1690, and died in what is now  called Orange county, New York, November.  '9' '^77Z- He spent his youth and early man-  hood in Ireland, leaving the island when he  was verging on his fortieth year. He was a  dissenter from the church that had been estab-  lished in the country, and in opposition to the  ruling powers in Ireland, so he resolved to  emigrate to America. With a party of friends  and relatives he chartered the vessel 'George  and Anne' of Dublin, and sailed May 20.  1720, for Philadelphia, where they proposed  to form a colony. Emigration in those days  was a risky proceeding, not only because of  the possible unseaworthiness of seagoing  craft, but because of the autocratic powers  possessed by the captains of vessels, whose  conduct to their passengers and crews often  left a great deal to be desired. When the  vessel bearing Charles Clinton and his family  and friends were well out at sea, the captain  formed a plan to starve the passengers in his  care for the purpose of possessing himself of  their property, and for the purpose also, it is  said, of preventing their immigration to  America. The result was that a large per-  centage of the passengers died, and among the  deceased were a son and daughter of Charles  Clinton. Those that survived were finally al-  lowed to land at Cape Cod, October 4, 1729,  having paid a large sum of money for the  preservation of their lives. A proposal to  wrest the command of the vessel from the  captain had previously failed, owing to a want  of energy among the victims. In the spring  of 1 73 1 the party settled in Ulster county,  New York, six miles west of the Hudson.  and sixty miles north of New York, where  Mr. Clinton pursued his occupation of farmer  and land surveyor. He was after^vards jus-  tice of the peace, county judge, and lieutenant-  colonel of the Ulster county militia. He was  made a lieutenant-colonel in Oliver Delaney's  regiment. March 24. 1758, and served under  Colonel Bradstreet at the siege and capture  of Fort Frontenac. He married Elizabeth  Denniston. Children: i. Alexander, born     April 17, 1732, died March, 1757; educated  at Princeton, and was a practising physician.  2. Charles, born July 20, 1734, died unmar-  ried, April 30, 1 791 ; he was also a physician  and surgeon in the army, attaining the rank  of colonel. 3. James, born in Ulster county,  New York. August 9, 1736, died in Little  Britain, Orange county, December 22, 18 12.  He was provided by his father with an ex-  cellent education, but his ruling inclination  was for military life. He was appointed an  ensign in the Second Regiment of Ulster  County Militia, and became its lieutenant-col-  onel before the beginning of the revolution.  During the war of 1756 between the English  and the French, he particularly distinguished  himself at the capture of Fort Frontenac,  where he was captain under Bradstreet, ren-  dering essential service by capturing a French  sloop-of-war on Lake Ontario. The confidence  reposed in his character may be estimated by  his appointment as captain-commandant of  four regiments levied for the protection of  the western frontiers of Ulster and Orange  counties. He was appointed colonel of the  Third New York Regiment, June 30. 1775,  and in the same year accompanied Montgom-  ery to Quebec. He was made brigadier-gen-  eral August 9. 1776, and commanded Fort  Chester when it was attacked in October,  1777, by Sir Henry Clinton. After a gallant  defence by about six hundred militia against  three thousand British troops. Fort Clinton,  as well as Fort Montgomery, of which his  celebrated brother. General George Clinton,  was commander-in-chief, was carried by  storm. General Clinton was the last man to  leave the works, receiving a severe bayonet  wound, but escaping from the enemy by rid-  ing a short distance and then sliding down a  precipice for something like a hundred feet  to the creek, whence he made his wav to the  monntain In 177Q he ioined with 1. 600 men  in the expedition of General Sullivan against  the Indians, proceeding up the IMohawk to  the head of Otsego Lake, where he succeeded  in floating his bateaux on the shallow outlet bv  damm.ing up the lake and then letting out  the water suddenly. After an engagement in  which the Indians were defeated with great  loss at Newtown (now Elmira\ all resistance  upon their part ceased, their settlements were  destroyed, and they fled to the British fort-  ress of Negara. General Clinton commanded     232     SOUTHERN x\E\V YORK     at Albany during a great part of the war, but  was present at the siege of Yorktown and  the evacuation of New York by the British.  He was a commissioner to adjust the boun-  dary line between New York and Pennsyl-  vania, and was a member of the legislature  and of the convention that adopted the con-  stitution of the United States. 4. George,  mentioned below.   (H) George, son of Charles and Elizabeth  (Denniston) Clinton, was born at Little  Britain. New York, July 26, 1739, and died  in ^\'ashington, D. C, April 20, 1812. On his  return from a privateering cruise in 1758 he  accompanied his father and brother James in  the expedition against Fort Frontenac as a  lieutenant, and, on the disbanding of the  colonial forces, he studied in the law office  of William Smith, and settled in his birth-  place, receiving shortly afterwards a clerk-  ship from the colonial governor. .'\dam George  Clinton, a connection of the family. He was  elected in 1768 to the New York assembly,  where he so resolutely maintained the cause  of the colonies against the crown that April  22, 1775. he was elected by the New York  provincial convention one of the delegates to  the second continental congress, taking his  seat May 15. He did not vote on the ques-  tion of independence, as the members of the  New York provincial congress, which he rep-  resented, did not consider themselves author-  ized to instruct their delegates to act on that  question. They jnirposely left it to the new  provincial congress, which met at White  Plains, July 8, 1776. and which on the next  day passed unanimously a resolution approv-  ing of the delegates. Clinton was likewise  prevented from signins: the Declaration of In-  dependence with the New York delegation of  July 15. by receiving, on the seventh of that  month, an imperative call from Washington to  take post in the Highlands, with the rank of  general of militia. This accident, which pre-  vented him from being a signer, he always  referred to in later days as the saddest event  of his life. In the spring of 1777 he was a  deputy to the New York provincial congress  which framed the state constitution, but was  again called into the field by congress, and  appointed March 25, 1777, a brigadier-general  in the Continental army. Assisted by his  brotlier James, he made a brilliant, though  unsuccessful, defence. October 6. 1777, of the     Highland forts, Clinton and Montgomery  against Sir Henry Clinton. He was chosen  first governor of the state April 20, 1777, and  in 1780 was re-elected to the office, which he  retained by successive elections until 1795.  I'rom the period of his occupation of the  gubernatorial chair until its final relinquish-  ment he exhibited great energy of character,  and in defence of the state rendered important  services, both in a- civil and military capacity.  In 1780 he thwarted an expedition led by Sir  John Johnston, Brant, and Cornplanter, into  the Mohawk Valley, and thus saved the set-  tlers from the horrors of the torch and scalp-  ing knife. He was active in preventing en-  croachments on the territory of New Y^ork by  settlers belonging to the New Hampshire  grants, and w\as largely instrumental with  Timothy Pickering in concluding after the  war lasting treaties of peace with the west-  ern Indians. In 1783 he accompanied Wash-  ington and Hamilton on a tour of the north-  ern and western parts of the state, on their  return visiting, with .Schuyler as a guide, the  High Rock of Saratoga. W'hile on this trip  he first conceived the project of a canal be-  tween the Mohawk and Wood creeks, which  he recommended to the legislature in his  speech opening the session of 1791. an idea  that was subsequently carried out to its legiti-  mate end in the Erie and Champlain canals by  his nephew, Governor De Witt Clinton, At  the time of Shay's Rebellion in 1787 he  marched in person at the head of the militia  against the insurgents, and by this prompt  action greatly aided the governor of Massa-  chusetts in quelling the outbreak. In 17S8 he  presided at the state convention to ratify the  federal constitution, the adoption of which he  opposed, beliving that too much power would  thereby pass to the federal congress and exec-  utive. At the first presidential election he re-  ceived three of the electoral votes ca«t for the  vice-presidency. In 1792. when Washington  was re-elected, Clinton had for the same of-  fice fifty votes, and at the sixth presidential  election, 1800-1813. he received six ballots  from New York for the ofificc of president.  In 1800 he \vas chosen to the legislature after  one of the most hotly contested elections in  the annals of the state. He participated in  the inauguration of General George Washing-  ton in the metropolis, in Wall street, and  escorted the president to his elegant 'city      GEORGE CLINTON   First Governor of New York, serving 1777 95. lSOl-04; was most active as a  Generol In the Revolution, and Vice-President 1805-12.

His most  enduring work is seen perhaps in the two  old forts on Governor's Island. In 1801 he  was again governor. In 1804 he was elected  vice-president of the United States, which  ofifite he filled until his death. His last im-  portant public act was to negative, by his  casting vote in the senate, the renewal of the  charter of the United States Bank in 181 1.  He took great interest in education, and in  his message at the opening session of the leg-  islature of 179s he initiated the movements  for the organization of a common school sys-  tem. As a military man Clinton was bold and  courageous, and endowed with a will that  rarely failed him in sudden emergencies. As  a civil magistrate he was a staunch friend to  literature and to social order. In private life  he was affectionate, winning, though dignified  in his manner, strong in his dislikes, and  warm in his friendships. The vast influence  that he wielded was due more to sound judg-  ment, marvelous energy and great moral force  than to any specially high-sounding or bril-  liant achievement. The old state papers show  that the governor was keenly alive to the  commercial prosperity of the state. He  favored all bills which he thought would ben-  efit the people, and so far as can be seen to-  day he was progressive almost to radicalism.  At the same time he had a well-balanced mind  and a keen knowledge of human nature. He  never went to extremes and never incurred  the extremes of opposition.   He married Cornelia Tappan. of Ulster  county, and had six children, one of them a  son George, whose only son died unmarried,  so that the family name has disappeared in  that branch of the family.     The family name of Pell is of  PELL Saxon origin, meaning remote, and   when compounded with 'ham,'' as  Pelham f mansion), signifies the mansion far  away, and such was the intent in selecting a  name for Pelham Manor. What the Mohegan  tribe of Indians, the Siwanovs, called this  particular tract on which the Pell family set-  tled is unknown. The arms of the Pell fam-  ily are: Ermine, on a canton azure a pelican  or, vulned gules. This coat was granted Oc-  tober IQ, 1504. The gold pelican and azure  field are also a portion of the charges be-  longing to the coat.     (II) John (2) Pell, B. A., at Cambridge,  1594, was fifth son of John (i) Pell, of Der-  singliam, Norfolk, England, of the ancient  family of Pell of Water Willoughby, Lincoln-  shire. John Pell Sr. was steward, or master  of the king's cup, and was living in 1597. His  wife was Margaret Overend, the only daugh-  ter of William Overend, Esq., and they had  six sons and three daughters. John Pell, Jr.,  above mentioned, was in holy orders, rector  of Southwyck, in Sussex county, England,  died in 1616. John Pell married Mary Hol-  land, of Kent, and they had two children :  Thomas, born in 1608, a gentleman of the  bedchamber to King Charles I., and John,  born March i, 161 1.   As it was the elder son who acquired the  grant of Pelham Manor, much popular inter-  est centers in Thomas Pell, although having  no issue the line of descent continues through  his younger brother, John, whose son in-  herited the property. It is believed that he  was born at Southwyck, in Sussex, about  1608, and the e.xact date of his arrival in  America is not known ; but it is certain that  he was one of the first to settle in New Eng-  land, for his name is associated with Roger  Ludlow, a member of Rev. John Warham's  company who first settled at Dorchester, Mas-  sachusetts, in June, 1630, and removed to  Windsor, Connecticut, 1635. Following this,  Ludlow began a plantation at Unquowa, the  Indian name by which Fairfield. Connecti-  cut, was known, and Thomas Pell was with  these ten families in 1635 at that place. His  name also appears in the colonial records of  New Haven in 1639 as executor of Richard  Jewell. It is known of him that on March  10, 1646, at a general court held in New  Haven, in recording the names of persons  seated in the meeting house, the governor and  deputv occupied the first middle seat and Mr.  Pell the first seat in the cross ones at the end.   On November 14, 1654, Thomas Pell, then  of Fairfield, Connecticut, obtained a ffrant  from the ancient Indian proprietors, embrac-  ing all that territory bounded on the ea.st by  a stream called Stoney brook or river, and so  running northward as the said brook or river  runs, eight English miles into the woods,  thence west to Broncks' river, then down the  stream of Broncks' river to a certain bend  in the said river, thence by marked trees south  until it reaches the tide waters of the Sound,     234     SOUTHERN .\EW YORK     which lyetli between Long Island and the  main land, together with all the island in the  sound, &c., &c. This grant was signed by  the Sachem Ann-hoock and five other Indians.  A. Dyckman occurs as witness. It was subse-  quently confirmed in council. He stated be-  fore a court of assize, in 1665, that he had  obtained license to make the purchase, from  the authorities of Connecticut, and that he  had paid large sums of money for the same.   In 1654, it was resolved, at a meeting of  the director-general and council of New  Nethcrland 'that whereas a few English are  beginning a settlement at a great distance  from our outposts on lands long before bought  and paid for, near Vreedland, to send there,  interdict, and the attorney-general, Cornelius  van Tienhoven, and forbid them to proceed no  farther, but to abandon that spot. Done at  Fort Amstel on the 3th of November, 1654, in  New Netherlands,' on lands 'purchased from  the Indians by the ?Ion. Thomas Pell of Fair-  field, Connecticut.' Despite this move and  several other protestations from the Dutch of-  ficials, Thomas Pell continued to settle his  tract up to the time of the surrender of the  Dutch in 1664. It is related as a curious fact  that the two leading sachems of Pelham,  Ann-hoock nVampage) and Himham or Nim-  ham. lived to a great age. In 1675 the Indians  must have been residing on the neck of land  in consiflcrable numbers, for at a general court  of assize held in that year it was resolved :  'that the Indyans at Mr. Pell's or Anne  Hook's neck be ordered to remove to their  usual winter quarters, within Hellgate. upon  this island : and further that all canoes be-  longing to Christians or Indyans on the north  side of Long Island to the east of Hellgate  shall be within three days from the publica-  tion of this order, brought to the next townes  and delivered to the constables to be secured  near the block-house. Any canoes found upon  the sound after that time to be destroyed.'  It is conjectured that this order was put forth  in order to prevent the Indians of Long Island  joining in the warfare made by King Philip  against the New England colonists.   One of the favorite burying grounds of the  river tribe of Indians was located near the  entrance of Pelham neck, whither they brought  their dead from as far as Horscneck. Con-  necticut, and a great many mounds of this  nature were even recently to be seen on prop-     erty of George Rapelje bordering the water.  Two of the largest of the mounds were long  pointed out as those of the Siwanoys sachems,  Ann-hoock and Nimham, and when the for-  mer was opened it was found to contain a  skelton of great size, by the side of which  lay the tenant's stone axe and flint spear-  head.   A charter for Pelham Manor was granted  by Governor Richard Nicolls on October 6,  1666, to Thomas Pell, reading in part as fol-  lows:   'Richard NicoUs Esq., Governor. Under his Royall  Highness the Duke of York, of all his territories in  America. To all to whom these presents shall come,  sendcth greeting. Whereas there is a certain tr.-ict  of land within this government upon the main, sit-  uate, lying and being to the eastward of Westchester  bounds, bounded to the westward with the river  called by the Indians, Aqueouncke, commonly known  by the English by the name of Hutchinson's river,  which runneth into the bay lying between Throck-  morton's neck and Ann Hooks neck, commonly  called Hutchinson's bay, bounded on the east by a  brook called Cedar Tree brook or Gravelly brook,  on the south by the sound, which lyeth between  Long Island and the main land, with all the islands  in the sound, not already granted or otherwise dis-  posed of. lying before that tract of land so bounded  as is before expressed, and northwards, to run into  the woods about eight English miles in breadth as  the bounds to the sound, which said tract of land  hath heretofore been purchased of the Indian pro-  prietors, and due satisfaction given for the same.  Now know ye, that by virtue of the commission  and authority unto me given, by his Royal Highness.  James. EHike of York, &c., upon whom by lawful  grant and pattent from his majesty, th? prouiieto'-y  and government of that part of the main land, as  well as of Long Island, as all the islands adjacent,  among other things is settled, I have thouglit proier  to give, grant, confirm and ratifv unto Thomas Pell  of Onckway, alias Fairfield, his majesty's colonv  of Connecticut, gentleman, his heirs and assigns, all  the said tract of land bounded as aforesaid, together  with all the lands, islands, sea-bays, woods, meadows,  pastures, marshes, lakes, waters, creeks, fishing,  hawking, hunting and fowling and all other profits,  commodities emoluments and hereditaments, * * * in  fee and common socage and bv fealty only, yielding,  rendering and paying, yearly and every year, unto his  royal highness, the duty forever, and his heirs, or to  such governor as shall from time to time be by him  constituted and appointed, as an acknowledgment,  one lamb upon the first day of May, if the same  shall be demanded. Given under my hand and -eal  at Fort Tames, in New York, on the island of Man-  hattan, the sixth day of October, in the i8th year of  the reign of our sovereign. T^ord Charles the second.  by the grace nf God. of England. Scotland. France  and Ireland. Defender of the Faith, &c., &c.. S— .  and in the year of our Lord God 1666.'   Sir Thomas Dongan, lieutenant-governor of     I     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     235     the Province of New York, on October 20,  1687, confirmed by letters patent, under the  great seal, the whole manor, employing much  the same description of the territory of the  tract of Pelliam Manor as in the original char-  ter; but saying: 'I would, in the behalfe of  his sacred Majesty, his heirs and suckcessors,  give and grant unto him, the said John Pell  [he having then inherited the Manor from  his uncle, Thomas Pell], a more full and firme  grant and confirmation of the above lands and  premises.'   The manor was famous for its location  near to the great seaport ; its fishing in the  vicinity was unsurpassed the entire length of  the sound ; bear, wolves and deer were aboun-  dant. offering inducement for the hunt in  order to provide both provision and pelf ; In-  dian wigwams occupied the site which first  assumed the civilization of manorial grounds  and later a place of residential activity, and  innumerable arrow-heads dug up by those  building there a century later prove that it  must have been a favorite hunting ground for  the Indians. The provincial assemblv was  obliged to take steps to destroy the wild ani-  mals roving in the locality now laid out as the  most modern of towns, enacting:   'Forasmuch as divers inhabitants of this colony  have suffered many grievous losses in their stock,  both of sheep and neat cattle, for the prevention of  which, and encouragement of those who shall de-  stroy wolves in the said colony, and that the breed  of wolves within this colony may be whollv rooted  out and extinguished, be it enacted. &c.. that in the  county of West Chester, twenty shillings for a grown  wolf killed bv a Christian, and fen shillings for such  a wolf killed by an Indian, and half that sum re-  spectively for a whelp.'   The remains of a wolf pit endured for  more than a century thereafter in Winter Hill  burving ground.   Thom.as Pell had hardly acquired the large  tract before he sought settlers to occupy a  portion of it. that he might acquire a sub-  stantial revenue, like the lords of other manors  on American soil. He sisrned the following  grant in i66d. in favor of grantees who re-  moved from Fairfield, Connecticut:   'Know all men by these presents, that I, Thomas  Pell, have granted to Tames Euestis and Philip  Pinckney, for themselves and their associates, to  the number of ten families, to settle down at Hutcb-  insons. that is where the house stood at the meadow  rnd uplands, to Hutchinson's river, they paving ac-  cording to ye proportion of the charges which was  disburst for the purchase, and other necessary     charges, only liberty to have the disposing of two  lotts upon the same terms with them, because that  I might provide them some tradesmen for their  comfort, as a smith, or weaver, or what else with  their approbation. Witness my hand, this 24th of  June, 1664. Thomas Pell.'   This is the covenant made in 1665 for their  government at Pelham :   'Articles of agreement betwi.xt us whose names are  underwritten, A. D. 1665. Imprimis — that we, by the  grace of God, sett down on the tract of land lying  betwixt Hutchinson's brook, where the house was.  until it comes unto that river that runneth in at  the head of the meadow. 2.

There was an old record bearings date about  1663. now said to be extant, which sot forth:   'The le.gislature of Connecticut determining to se-  cure as far as possible the lands w-ithin the limits  of their charter, authorized one Thomas Pell to pur-  chase of the Indian proprietors all that tract between  Westchester and Iludson's river, and the waters  which made the Manhadoes an island, and resolved  that it should be added to Westchester.'   Thomas Pell undoubtedlj' died some time  between the date he made his will, signed  September 21, 1669, and the date of the order  for taking the inventory of his estate, which  was October 13. 1660. In that final document  of the founder of Pelham he states that the  Lord had 'lately taken to himselfe my be-  loved wife Lucy, it lieing ye good pleasure of  God to deny mc natural issue of my owne  body.' and in these words made provision for  the main portion of his estate:   'This being my last will and testament — I doe  make my nephew, John Pell, living in ould England,  the nnlv sonne of my only brother John Pell, Doctor  of Divinity, which he had bv his first wife, my whole  and sole hcire of all my lands and hotjscs in any  parte of New England, or in ye territorves of ye  Duke of Yorke. I also give to my nephew John  Pell (my whole and sole heire) all my goods, move-  able or immoveable whatsoever — money, plate, chat-  tells and cattle of all kinds — except such parcells  and legacyes which I give and benueath to persons  as followeth, my just debts being first paid.'   Thomas Pell died leaving an honored mem-  ory. He had served with Lion Gardiner at  Fort Saybrook and was a surgeon in the  Pcquot war. From 1664 to 1665 he was a  deputy to the general court. He iriarried Lucy  Brewster, of New Haven, Connecticut.   (HI) The Rev. John (3^ Pell, D. D., F. R.  S., son of John (2) and Mary (Holland')  Pell, was born 'Nf.irrh i, t6ii, at Southwick.     in Sussex, England, died at London, about  December 12, 1685; buried in the Rector's  vault at St. Giles' Church, London. At the  age of thirteen he entered Trinity College,  Cambridge, and received the degree of A. B.  in 1630, afterwards D. D. ; he was also ad-  mitted to an ad eundein degree at Oxford.  He was elected professor of mathematics  at Amsterdam and Breda, where he at-  tained a high reputation. .From 1654 to  1658 he was Cromwell's Minister Resident  with Protestant Cantons of Switzerland.  After the restoration of Charles XL, he  ijecame rector of Fobbing, Laindon and  Orset, in Essex. He was appointed Domestic  Chaplain to the Archbishop of Canterbury,  and on May 20, 1663, was elected Fellow of  the Royal Society. A great many of his pri-  vate papers are preserved in the British Mu-  seum, contained in over ten volumes of manu-  script. He married, in 1632, Ithamaria, daugh-  ter of Henry Reginolles, and left one son,  John, see forward, and four daughters : Mary,  born April 14, 1634, married, 1656, Captain  Ravee: Elizabeth, born 1639, married, i(J64,   John Edwards ; Bathsheba, married Wes-   sels ; Judith, married, 1657. Thomas Kirke.   (IV) Hon. John (4) Pell, son of Rev.  John (3) and Ithamaria (Reginolles) Pell,  was born February 3, 1643, in London, Eng-  land, died at Pelham Manor, Province of New  York, in 1702. Upon inheriting the West-  chester property, known as Pelham Manor  from his uncle, Thomas Pell, who had died  without issue, he came to America, arriving at  Boston. Massachusetts, in October, 1670, with  letters to Governor Winthrop, which estab-  lished his heirship. He was thus the second  Lord of the Manor of Pelham, and was com-  monly called Sir John Pell. He was appointed  captain of horse in 1684, and major in the  French and Indian wars, 1692. He was made  first judge of court of common pleas in West-  chester county, 1688, and was the first mem-  ber for that county in the provincial assembly,  1691-95. He married Rachel, dauehter of  Philip Pinckncy, of Eastchester. Children :  Thomas, see forward ; John, died unmarried  in Philadelphia : Ada, married Honey-  well ; Tamar, married James Eustis : Mary,  married Samuel Rodinan.   (V) Thomas, son of Hon. John (4) and  Rachel (Pinckney) Pell, was born circa 1676,  and died circa 1739, the year in which his     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     237     will was dated, which is numbered 18,154 in  the surrogate's office for New York. He was  third Lord of the Manor of Pelham. He  married Anna, who was by tradition the  daughter of Ninham or Wampage, an Indian  sachem. Children: i. John, born in 1702,   died in 1773; married Totten, leaving   issue. 2. Thomas, born in 1704, died in 1753;  married Dorothy Ward, leaving issue. 3.  David, died (s. p.) circa 1735. 4.

Sarah, married Benjamin Guion.   (VII) Benjamin, son of Joshua and Phoebe  (Palmer) Pell, was born at Pelham Manor,  Westchester county. New York, in 1750, died  in March, 1828. Because of his Tory sym-  pathies he was forced to leave the country  during the revolution, and went to Canada to  reside for a time;» He later engaged in busi-  ness at Burlington, Vermont. As his prop-  erty was for a long period directly in the storm  center of the conflict, he could not well have  remained and persisted in his adherence to the  crown. The British forces landed at Pelham  Neck on October 18, 1776, ten days previous  to the battle of White Plains, and General  Heath left on account of the plan of attack,  which he wrote two davs previous.   'The general officers of the .'\nierican army rode  to reconnoitre the ground at Pell's Neck. &c.. and it  was determined that the position of the American  army should be immediately changed; the left flank  to be extended more northerly, to prevent its being     turned by the British, who were at this time posted  on Inrogmorton's Neck.'   On the day of the landing, General Heath  wrote :   'On the i8th of October the wind was now fre^h  at southwest, the British crossed to the other side of  Frogs Neck, embarked on board their boats, crossed  over the cove. landed on Pell's Neck, and moved  briskly upwards. Three or four of the American  regiments advanced towards them and took a good  position behind a stone fence. When the British  had advanced sufficiently near, they gave them a  pretty close fire, which checked them, and even  obliged them to fall back; but being immediately  supported, they returned vigorously to the charge.  The action was sharp for a short time, but the  Americans were soon obliged to give way to supe-  rior force. Shepard's, Read's, Baldwin's, and  Glover's regiments had the principal share in this  action. The .'\mericans had between thirty and fortv  men killed and wounded ; among the latter Colonel  Shepard, in the throat, not mortally, although the  ball came well night effecting instant death. The  loss of the British was not known, but must have  been considerable. They advanced almost to New  Rochelle, and halted.'   Benjamin Pell married (first), November  25, 1778, Mary Anna Ferris, dau,ghter of  John Ferris of 'The Grove Farm,' in West-  chester county. New York. He married (sec-  ond) Titus. He married (third)   Folger. Children, by first wife: i. William  Ferris, see forward. 2.

Brinckerhoff ; James Duane, died in 1881,  married Sophia Pell ; John Au,gustus, died in  1894, married Susan Field; Richard M., died  s. p., April 22, 1882, married Fanny Jones ;  George W., died in 1893, married Mary Bruen.   3. Ferris (Colonel) married Mariana Chan-  nine, and died in 1850. Child by second wife:   4. Gilbert, married Eliza, daughter of Hon.  Morris Birbeck and had Morris Birbeck, a  senior wrangler of Cambridge University,  afterwards moved to Australia.   (VIII) William Ferris, son of Benjamin  and Mary Anna (Ferris) Pell, was born at  the 'Grove Farm,' Westchester county, New  York, September, 1779, died at New York  City. October 28, 1840. In 1802, when a man  of about twenty-three years of age, he jour-  neyed with his father from Canada by the in-  land water route, via Lake Champlain. Lake  George and the Hudson River, and when mak-  ing the portage between the two lakes he  was much impressed with the rare beauty and     238     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     picturesqueness of the neck of land on which  the ancient ruins of Fort Ticonderoga stood.  He desired to possess that region if possible;  but in the meantime, following his return, the  property had been deeded to Columbia and  Union colleges by the state of New York. In  1818 Mr. Pell succeeded in purchasing the  land. Why he waited twelve years to make  the purchase is not known, but probably the  colleges would not sell. There he built a  house looking out upon Lake Champlain and  with the old fort in the immediate vicinity as  another attraction. In 1825 his house was  burned, and a great deal of furniture was de-  stroyed, as well as plate and manuscripts  which had been taken from the Manor House  at Pelham, during the revolution, to Halifax,  Nova Scotia, thence to Ticonderoga. The  next year he erected the present house, known  as 'The Pavilion,' which now stands near the  lake front, under the fort. It is unusually  broad, containing some eight rooms stretched  alone the front of the first floor, the central  one being the reception or living room, and the  next northward, to the right, the dining room,  which is furnished completely in the style of  the period in which the house was built, name-  ly antiques of the revolutionary days, so that  it is a treat for visitors to view it, and by  its peculiar quaintness is restful to the eye.  This is as it should be, for it is now the  family summer retreat, whither they repair  for recreation from the cares of city life.  After Mr. Pell's death, in 1840, although still  remaining in possession of his family, it was  neHectcd and the place fell into decay.   William Ferris Pell married.

His residence is at No.  3 East Sixty-ninth street.   In 190S Mr. Pell visited Fort Ticonderoga  for the first time in twenty-five years. He was  much imjjressed with the beauty and possi-  bilities of the place, just as his ancestor had  been a hundred and six years before, and  immediately proceeded to buy out the other  heirs. Having succeeded, he started to restore  the property to something of its former  beauty. The Fort itself had been a 'Happy  Hunting-ground' for relic hunters and ex-  cursionists for many years, and the few re-  maining walls were in a state of great dilapi-  dation, ready to fall at any moment. Colonel  Robert M. Thompson, father-in-law of Mr.  Pell, became interested in the restoration of  the fort proper, and authorized the rebuilding  of the West Barracks and the Northwest and  Southwest Bastions, which work was com-  pleted the following year. Old cannons were  stationed along the ramparts, and it once  again assumed the appearance it boasted when  Abercrombie, Montcalm, Amherst, Allen and  Arnold were leading figures there and enacted  world history, the important facts of which  are common to everyone. The restored build-  ing was made a museum, and in it are now  stored the many relics which were found dur-  ing the work, as well as many interesting ar-  ticles connected with the French and Indian  wars and the revolution, collected by the pres-  ent owner with much pains. It likewise con-  tains one of the most valuable historical li-  braries in the country, in so far as the relation  of the books to the conflicts of northern New  York, numbering into the thousands. The  estate at present consists of about two thou-  sand acres, lying on both sides of Lake Cham-  plain, and includes the historic Mount Inde-  pendence, in Vermont, upon which were quar-  tered the greater part of the army which re-  treated before Burgoyne, in T777. From the  ramparts one gains an admirable view of Lake  Champlain, extending northwards to where  Arnold's famous naval combat took place, and  southward towards Whitehall, being the  course taken by General Arthur St. Clair's  army when Burgoyne was at its heels. The  whole scene brings back to mind the manoeu-     vres of a century and a quarter ago, if one is  acquainted with the story. On the lower plain,  close to the shore, is The Pavilion, which Mr.  Pell's family occupies as a summer residence.   Stephen H. P. Pell married, at New York,  April 17, 1901, Sarah Gibbs Thompson, born  at Boston, Massachusetts, May 30, 1879,  daughter of Colonel Robert M. and Sarah  (Gibbs) Thompson. The latter a daughter of  Governor M. C. Gibbs, of Rhode Island.  Children : Robert Thompson, born at New  York. March 9, 1902 ; John Howland Gibbs,  born at Southampton, Long Island, August 9,  1904.   (XI) Theodore Roosevelt, eighth child of  John Howland and Caroline Townsend (Hy-  att) Pell, was born at Yonkers, New York,  May 12, 1878, and resides in New York City.  He was educated at the Berkeley School in  New York, and chose the real estate business  for his profession, with offices at No. 542  Fifth avenue, where he is conducting a busi-  ness principally in suburban property, this  having become one of the well known firms  of the city. He is a Republican and Episco-  palian, and a member of the Society of Colo-  nial Wars. St. Nicholas Society, Sons of  Veterans of the Civil \\'ar. Society of .Ameri-  can Wars, Colonial Order of the Acorn, and  Order of Colonial Lords of Manors in Amer-  ica. He married, at Philadelphia, Pennsyl-  vania, November 25. 1Q03, Florence, daughter  of Edwin S. and Dorothy Baird (Keefer)  Cramp.     Among the pioneer settlers of  SMIDT America none occupied a more   important position than the smith  whose skill supplied all nails used in construc-  tion and nearly every implement employed in  the development of the various industries.  There were many who came from England  bearing this name, which was assumed as a  natronymic by many people of the old world.  The family herein traced descended from a  Dutch immigrant, who does not seem to have  adopted a surname until about the third gen-  eration, as is the case with most of the people  of that origin in the state. Among the most  distinguished descendants of the name was  the noted scholar and philanthropist. Gerrit  Smith, who was born in Madison countv. In  or near the city of Tiel. on the Rhine in the  Netherlands, lived early in the seventeenth     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     24 T     ceiitury one Lambert, a smidt. He was born  not later than 1605, and probably considerably  earlier. His two sons, Adriaen and Cornelius,  appear in the early records of New Nether-  lands and were the founders of the family in  America.   (I) Adriaen Lambertsen Smidt with his  wife and six children, and his nephew, Jacob  Hendrix, embarked in the good ship 'De  Rooseboom' (The Rosetree), Captain Pieter  Reyersz \'an der Beets, earlv in 1663, and  reached New Amsterdam on March 15, 1663.  A close study of the church records of that  period has revealed the names of four of these  children, namely : Cornelius Adriaensen, Cath-  alina Adriaensen, W'illemtje Adriaensen. and  Lambert Adriaensen. He was probably like  his father a smith by trade, and among- the  original purchasers from the Indians of a tract  in the Tappan Patent, and for some time lived  there. He disposed of his interest in the pur-  chase some time prior to 1704.   (H) Lambert Adriaensen, son of .Adriaen  Lambertsen Smidt, resided at Tanpan in 1605,  and seems to have been one of the leading  men in the little community, taking a deep in-  terest in the work of the Tapnan church, and  served as an elder in the church. He was still  living in 1750 and must have been at least  ninety years old. The records of the Tappan  church show the baptism of Lambert .'Vdriaen-  sen, January 30, 1714. He married, in New  York. Margrietje Garretse Blauvelt, baptized  March 27, 1670, in New York, daughter of  Gerrit Hendr\-cksen and his wife.

He settled at Tappan, where  he was admitted to the church in 170S, and  later served as deacon and elder. This region  was then a part of Orange county, and he was  a member of the militia company of that  county in 1715. He was a smith bv occupa-  tion, and last appeared on the record in 1750.     Part of his children were baptized at Hacken-  .'iack, New Jersey. He built a warehouse at  Greenbush (now Blauveltville), which was  torn down during the revolution, and after-  wards rebuilt by his descendants. .He mar-  ried, October 11, 1710, at Tappan, Brechtje,  daughter of Peter and Margaret (Bogart)  Haring. The latter was the daughter of Jan  Louwe Bogart, born 1630, and his wife, Cor-  nelia (Everts) Bogart.

Children : William Prav,     244     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Eliza Palmer, Jane Ann, who married John  C. T. Smidt (see Smidt VIII).     The Sage family was without  SAGE doubt of Scandivanian origin, and  the name at first was Saga. When  the Norsemen conquered Normandy, in  France, they generally softened the final 'a'  tone, thus making Saga, Sage, and added a  French suffix to denote landed occupation.  To the first Norman Saga or Sage was added  ville or town, ■ thus making it Sagevillc. or  Sagetown, or land. As these spread to other  countries the name was subjected to other  changes. In Germany it was Saige or Sauge,  the same in Switzerland, while in France it  was Le Sage. The name is first found in Eng-  land on the Battle Abbey Roll, in 10^)6. This  roll was prepared by the monJ<s of Rattle Ab-  bey at the command of William the Con-  queror, to perpetuate the names of those who  took part in the battle of Hastings, which gave  him the English throne. It is there recorded  Sageville. All of the name in England, Scot-  land, and Wales originated in this way. The  family was granted a coat-of-arms, which is  used by the .A.merican family.   (I) David Sage, American ancestor of the  family in Troy, under consideration, was born  in 16,^9, a native of Wales. He was one of  the first settlers of Middletown, Connecticut,  where he is of record in 1652. He settled  upon a tract of land now part of the town of  Cromwell, upon the banks of the Connecticut  river, where .some of his descendants yet re-  side. His will, dated March 27, 1703, is in  the probate office at Hartford, Connecticut.

(V) Elisha (2), second son of Elisha ( T)  and Martha (Montague) Sage, was born Jan-  uary 2=;, T779, and died in Oneida county.  New York, 1854. With this generation the  family apnear in New York state. Elisha (2)  married Prudence Rislcy. probably at Hart- .  ford, Connecticut, before his removal to  Oneida countv. New York.

(VI) Russell, fifth son of Elisha (2) and  Prudence (Risley) Sa?e, was born in the  little settlement of Shenandoah, in Verona  township, Oneida county. New York, August  4, i8t6, and died at Lawrence, Long Island.  July 22, 1906, Two years after his birth his  father removed to a farm near Durhamvillc      BY PERMISSION OF NATIONAL CYCLOPEDIA OF AMERICAN BIOGRAPHY     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     245     in the same county, and there remained until  his death in 1854. There young Russell lived  and attended the district schools in winter and  worl<ed upon the farm the rest of the year  until he was fourteen years of age, when he  was sent to his brother, Henry Risley Sage,  who had a store in Troy, New York. The  work was hard, but he had his earnings to  himself and improved himself by diligent  study. Before he was twenty-one he had paid  oft the mortgage on his father's farm, was the  owner of several city lots, and of a sloop  which he navigated from Troy to New York.  Later he abandoned his clerkship and entered  into partnership with his brother, whom he  was able to buy out in two years. In 1839 he  sold out his store at a profit and entered into  the wholesale grocery and commission busi-  ness with John W. Bates as partner. The  firm in a short time controlled several branches  of the trade, not only in Troy but in Albany.  He became one of the directors of the Troy  & .Schenectady railroad, and afterwards presi-  dent of the same, and held office when the rail-  road was united with the general system be-  tween Albany, Troy, and Buffalo. At that  time in 1853 Mr. Sage was elected a director  in the consolidated company in the New York  Central and served six years. A little later  he became a large owner in the La Crosse  railroad.   In his earlier years Mr. Sage was deeplv  interested in public afYairs and took a promi-  nent part in political matters in the state of  New York. \\''hen a resident of Troy in 1845  he was elected to the board of aldermen.  While holding this office he was also made  treasurer of Rensselaer county, the finances  of which were in a tangled condition. He  sneedilv straightened them out and held the  office for seven years. In 1848 he was a dele-  gate to the national convention of the Whie  party. He controlled twenty-eight out of  thirty-two New York delegates, and took a  leading part in the nomination of General  Zachary Taylor for the presidency. It was  at his susrgestion that the convention nomi-  nated Millard Fillmore for vice-president,  which selection made him president, for Gen-  eral Tavlor died while in office and Fillmore  succeeded him. In 1850 Mr. Sage was nom-  inated for congress by the Troy Whigs, but  owine: to the defection of a faction of the  party he was defeated. He was again nomi-     nated in 1852 and was elected by a small ma-  jority. Two years later he was returned to  congress by the unprecedented majority of  7,000 votes. During his four years in con-  gress the great talents of Mr. Sage in financial  matters found recognition in his appointment  as a member of the ways and means commit-  tee, the most important committee of the  house. He served also on the invalid pension  committee which had charge of the pensions  incurred by the Mexican war, and took part  in the five weeks struggle which finally re-  sulted in the election of Nathaniel Banks as  speaker. But the incident in his professional  career which brought him most reputation was  the appointment of a committee throu.gh his  efforts to inquire into the condition of Wash-  ington's old estate at Mount Vernon, Virginia.  The committee's report bore fruit in the for-  mation of the Mount Vernon Association, the  purchase of the estate, and its dedication as  a permanent memorial to the father of his  country.   The panic of 1857 which ruined so many  while it left him comparatively unscathed, had  an important effecjt on his business career. He  had advanced considerable money in the La  Cross railroad. To protect his loans he found  himself compelled to advance still larger  amounts, and finally three legal proceedings  to become owner of the railroad, which ulti-  mately extended into the Chicago, Milwaukee  & St. Paul system. During his career he  achieved the presidency of no less than twen-  ty transportation corporations. He was con-  nected in an official capacity, at one time or  another, with the Iowa Central, Union Pacific.  Missouri Pacific, St. Louis, Iron Mountain &  Southern; Wabash, Texas & Pacific; Troy &  Bennington ; Troy & Boston ; Delaware, Lack-  awanna & Western ; Chicago, Milwaukee &  St. Paul ; Manhattan Elevated, and other rail-  roads. He was one of the largest stockhold-  ers in the Manhattan Elevated, and took an  active part in its management. Other enter-  prises with which he had been active are the  Pacific Mail Steamship Company; the Mer-  cantile Trust Company ; the Importers and  Traders' National Bank ; Western Union Tel-  egraph : International Ocean Telegraph ;  American Teleeraph and Cable Company : the  Standard Gas Light Company, and the Fifth  Avenue Bank, of which bank he was one of  the founders and the only one living at the     246     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     time of his death. In 1863 Mr. Sage gave  up his Troy business altogether and removed  to New York to devote himself to the promo-  tion of his own and other railroads and to  operations in stocks. He opened an ofifice in  William street and gave his first attention to  Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul securities.  Later he extended his interest to other rail-  roads, and gradually enlarged his field of oper-  ations until it covered nearly the whole range  of stocks listed on the Exchange. One of the  features of Mr. Sage's financial career was his  friendship with Jay Gould. They had come  together as promoters of the .Atlantic & Pa-  cific Telegraph Company, which was later  merged into the Western Union. On Decem-  ber 4, 1901, Mr. Sage, while in his office, es-  caped instant death as by a miracle. An in-  sane crank, Henry W. Norcross, of Somcr-  villc, Massachusetts, entered the office, carry-  ing a bag loaded with dynamite, and demanded  that the sum of $1,200,000 be given to him  immediately or he would blow up the building.  Mr. Sage saw that he was in the presence of  a madman, rose and retreated from him ;  whereupon the maniac exclaimed : 'Well then,  here goes', and lifting the bag high in the air  dashed it violently on the floor. The explo-  sion which followed blew off the dynamiter's  head, killed a clerk, injured others, and  wrecked the office. Mr. Sage received wounds,  but was able to return to the office in a few  days. Mr. Sage was a man of remarkable  and varied powers. He could have succeeded  in almost any field of action that he might  have chosen. He chose rather the largest,  hardest and most dangerous field of all — the  development of the transportation system of  the country, for he was above all else, and  from first to last, a promoter and manager of  railroads. That he was also a lender of mon-  ey, particularly in his old age, was merely an  incident in his long and useful life. 'He was  an .Xmcrican and loved his country', said  Henry Clews on hearing of his death. 'My  aim jn life', so he confessed in an interview  which was published December ig, 1897, in  the New York Herald, 'has been to do my  share in developing the material resources of  the country. I have spent millions on the  railroad system of the ITnitcd States and am  now connected with more than twentv thou-  sand miles of railroad and with twenty-seven  different corporations'.     Russell Sage was twice married, but had no  children. He married (first) in 1841, Marie,  daughter of Moses I. Wynne, of Troy, New  York; she died in 1867. He married (second)  November 24, 1869, Margaret Olivia Slocum,  born September 8, 1828, daughter of Hon.  Joseph Slocum of Syracuse, New York (see  Slocum).   (The Slocum Line.)   The origin of this family is in some degree  indicated by the name, which is supposed to  be derived from a locality where there was an  abundant growth of sloe. Another theory is  that the name was originally Combe, and that  a second or third son of a Combe won dis-  tinction that entitled him to be known as James  or John Combe, of the Sloe, changed later to  Sloe-combe. It is claimed, and confirmed by  the records, that Anthony, Giles and Edward  Slocombe came to New England about the  same time and were the progenitors of most  of the Slocums or Clocombs of this country.  They were probably brothers, although the re-  lationship has never been established. They  probably all went first to Plymouth colony.  Edward, the youngest, was in Taunton in 1643.  He is mentioned in the Plymouth colony rec-  ords in June, 1647. 'is one of the supervisors of  the hitrhway for Taunton. Giles and Edward  probably remained there, and, while .A.nthony  had lived at Taunton, his religious views and  love of liberty and his identity with the Society  of Friends, who were under the ban of the  Plymouth authorities, no doubt necessitated  his removal to Rhode Island, within the juris-  diction of the liberal-minded Roger Williams,  who gave a hearty welcome to the persecuted  of every class.   (I) Anthony Slocum, immigrant ancestor of  the American family bearing the name, was  one of the forty-six 'first and ancient purchas-  ers' A. D. 1637, of the territory of Cohannat.  which was incorporated in March, 1639. with  the name of Tatmton in New Plymouth, and  from which the present Taunton, Raynham  and Berkeley have been organized. His name  appears on the town records in various capaci-  ties as surveyor of highways and other posi-  tions. The place where he settled near Pas-  camauset river is more generally known as  Slocum's river. The frajrment of a letter  written by his brother-in-law, without date,  indicates that his wife's nan'e was Harvey.  Giles was one of their children.     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     247     (II) Giles, son of Anthony Slocum, wis  born in Somerset, England, <ind died in \6b2.  He came to this country and settled in what  is now the township of Taunton, New Ply-  mouth, previous to 1675. Giles Slocombe and  his wife were early members of the Society  of Friends. The Friends' records for Ports-  mouth, Rhode Island, show that 'Joan Slo-  cum, the wife of old Giles, she dyed at Forts-  mouth the 31st mo. 1670'. He died in 1682.  Peleg was one of their children.   (III) Rev. Peleg Slocum, son of Giles and  Joan Slocum, was born at Portsmouth, Rhode  Island, January 17, 1654. He is named as one  of the proprietors of Dartmouth in the con-  firmatory deed of Governor William Bradford,  November 13, 1694. In 1698 he and others  'undertake to build the meeting house for the  people of God in scorn called Quakers, 35 ft.  long, 30 ft. wide, and 14 ft. stud'. Peleg  Slocum's subscription of fifteen pounds was  the largest on the list and three times larger  than any of them with the exception of that  from John Tucker, who gave ten pounds.  Peleg Slocum is recorded in the Friends' rec-  ord as a minister. Richardson, in his journal,  1701, wrote: 'Peleg Slocum, an honest public  friend, carried us in his sloop to Nantucket'.  He married Mary Holder, daughter of Chris-  topher Holder, born in Gloucester. England,  in 1631. Mary died August 20, 1737, aged  seventy-five years. One of their children was  Joseph :   (IV) Joseph, son of Peleg and Mary  (Holder) Slocum, was born March 13, 1701,  at Dartmouth, Massachusetts. He was admit-  ted a freeman of Newport, Rhode Island, in  1722. He was named in his father's will,  June 13. T731, as joint executor with his  brother Holder; but in a letter dated at New-  port February 5, 1732, he declined to act in  that capacity and requested Holder to assume  entire control of the estate. He succeeded his  father in possession of Patience Island, Nar-  ragansett Bay, Rhode Island. He married,  in 1 72 1, Susanna Wanton, born 1704, daughter  of Hon. John Wanton, who was chosen gov-  ernor of Rhode Island.   (V) John, son of Joseph and Susanna (Wan-  ton) Slocum. was born Mav 5. 1727. in or near  the village of Newport. He was a prosper-  ous farmer and lived a quiet uneventful life.  He married. June 30, 1754, Hannah, daugh-  ter of William Brown and Rebecca (Law-     ton) Brown, born at Portsmouth, Rhode Is-  land, June 23, 1735. Children: John, born  December 20, 1759, married Phebe Durfee;  Peleg, 1765, married Hannah Stoddard;  Mary, May 4, 1767; William Brown, men-  tioned below.   (VI) Rev. William Brown Slocum, son of  John and Rebecca (Brown) Slocum, was  born in Middleton, Newport county, Rhode  Island, April 20, 1770, and died at Speigle-  town, Rensselaer county. New York, May  29, 1823. Soon after his marriage he re-  moved to Rensselaer county, where he cul-  tivated a large farm and was also a dealer  in live stock. He took an active and promi-  nent part in the public affairs of the state  and county, and in 1820 was elected to the  state assembly. His contemporaries and  co-workers were the Clintons, the Van  Rensselaers, the Livingstons, and other  men of that stamp who laid the foundation  of our commercial prosperity. Both his  public and private life were exemplary in  the highest degree, and he enjoyed a per-  sonal popularity due to his noble and manly  qualities. He married Olivia Josselyn,  daughter of Stockbridge Josselyn and Olivia  Standish, April 28, 1793. She died in Lan-  singburgh, New York, greatly loved and  honored by all who knew her. Children, all  born in Rensselaer county: Mary, born  1795, married John H. Groesbeck ; Almira,  1797, died in Raymertown, New York, un-  married; Isaac; Joseph, mentioned below;  Hiram, May 2, 1802, married Elizabeth van  Vechten; Eliza, married Augustus Strong;  William Brown, died in New Orleans, Lou-  isiana, unmarried; Maria, married Clark  Perry; Lucy Josselyn, died unmarried.   (VII) Hon. Joseph Slocum, son of Rev.  William Brown and Olivia (Josselyn) Slo-  cum, was born in Schaghticoke township,  Rensselaer county, New York, in 1800, and  died at Syracuse, March 20, 1853. He set-  tled in Syracuse, where he became a suc-  cessful merchant and leader in public af-  fairs. He was elected to the state legisla-  ture in 1849. He subsequently made a  journey to Russia, and was employed by  the government to establish agricultural  schools in the empire. He lived an honored  and useful life and left a bright example of  true manhood and uprightness of character.  He married, in Cambridge, New York, May     248     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     4, 1825, Margaret Pierson Jermain, daugh-  ter of Major John Jermain, first of White  Plains. New York, and later of Sag Har-  bor. Long Island. Children: Margaret  Olivia; Colonel Joseph Jermain, born June  24. 18^3.   (VHl; Margaret Olivia, daughter of Hon.  Joseph and Margaret Pierson (Jermain)  Slocum, was born at Syracuse, in 1828, and  was married to Russell Sage in 1869. She  inherits without doubt the best traits of  her distinguished ancestors. In 1846 she  entered Troy Seminary and graduated in  1847. The following year she passed in  her home in Syracuse, until through the  financial reverses of her father she resolved  to become a teacher. She secured a posi-  tion with her friend and former teacher in  Trov. Mrs. Henriettc Dilaye. of the Chest-  nut Seminary in Philadelphia. There Miss  Slocum remained for two years, meeting her  responsibilities with cheerful efficiency.  Amid the responsibilities of her social po-  sition through her married and affluent life,  she has been true to her early motto. Her  benefactions have been unstinted and her  executive ability in her public philanthro-  ])ies has already passed into history. Of-  ficially connected with the Women's Chris-  tian Union as treasurer, the Women's Hos-  pital for thirty years, the New York Ex-  change for Woman's Work, the Home and  Foreign Missions Society, the American  Forestry Association, Colonial Dames, pres-  ident of the Emma Willard Association,  member of the New York Peace Society, the  Society of Mayflower Descendants, besides  numerous other local organizations, she has  for many years served the interests of those  institutions with conspicuous fidelity. Af-  ter the death of her husband she was called  upon to assume the responsibility of man-  aging the immense estate left to her dis-  cretion as executrix, and with the exception  of a few bequests was the chief beneficiary  u'uler the will. So great was the confidence  of -Mr. Sage in iier ability to handle and  disjjose of his accumulated millions, that  there was not a single qualification or re-  striction made in the will. To enumerate  all her educational charities and other noble  enterprises would be simply a repetition  adding little to her repute as one of the  createst benefactors of the age.     Like many of the Dutch  BL.'\UYELT families, the immigrant  ancestor of this line did  not employ a surname. The family has  been long distinguished in the history of  Southern New York, and is very numerous-  ly distributed through Rockland county, in  this state, and Bergen county, New Jersey,  whence they have spread and are now ac-  tively identified with the growth and prog-  ress of many communities. One of the first  patroons to establish a colony in New York,  under the auspices of the Dutch West In-  dia Company, was Kiliaen \'an Rensselaer,  whose operations are extensively described  in the recent work on the Hudson-Mohawk  Valleys, published by the Lewis Historical  Publishing Company of New York. By the  terms of his grant, Van Rensselaer was re-  quired to establish a colony of fifty souls,  over fifteen years of age, within four years  of his grant made in November, 1629, and  within the first ten years he sent over  eighty-one persons. Several of these were  from Nykerk, Van Rensselaer's native  place, in Deventer, province of Gelderland.  Late in December, 1637, the good ship 'De  Calmar Sleutel'' (The Key of Kalmar), un-  der command of Peter Minuit, in the serv-  ice of the crown of Sweden, having been  oljjiged on account of storm to seek shelter  at the Texel, lay at anchor waiting for a  favorable east wind to sail for the far away  new world. Van Rensselaer, wishing to  send settlers and supplies to his colony,  seized the opportunity to forward 'what in  haste and half disorder' he had 'been able  to bring together'. By this vessel he was  able to dispatch six persons.   (I) Among these was Gerrit Hendryck-  sen, of Nykerk. a shoemaker, then fifteen  years of age 'intended for the tobacco plant-  ing in the new world.' He was engaged  for six years at wages, ranging from forty  francs to one hundred francs a year. It  appears that he remained three years with  a colony planted by Minuit, near the pres-  ent city of Wilmington, Delaware, as record  of the payment of his first three years'  wages has been found. He does not appear  on the records there after 1642. It was  probably about this time that he removed  to New Amsterdam, and he first appears in  the records of that colony. May 7. 1646.     SOUTHERiN NEW YORK     249'     when he married Marie Lamberts Moll,  i)orn in New York about 1625, daughter of  Lambert Huybertson Moll, of Bushwick.  The Moll family was of considerable prom-  inence in New Amsterdam, and Hendryck-  sen's wife was among the first American  born children in New Netherland. Lam-  bert H. Moll bought a half acre in New  Amsterdam in 1649 on which he built a  house which stood about on the site of the  present building at No. 253 Pearl street.  On December 6, 1646, Hendrycksen re-  ceived from the Director General William  Kieft a grant of a farm known as the  Schout's Bowery. A copy of this grant is  now in fhe ofifice of the city clerk in New  York City. In addition to this he received  a grant of a marsh, May 3, 1664, from Gov-  ernor Petrus Stuyvesant. The use of this  marsh was included by the grant of Gov-  ernor Kieft. The boundaries of this farm  are not given in the grant and it is there-  fore impossible to give its exact location,  but it constituted about fifty-three acres  somewhere in the vicinity of Stuyvesant's  Bowery on the east side of the Bowery  Road, and the marsh was intended for pas-  turage. From the records of a law suit  concerning a right of w-ay for Stuyvesant, it  is probable that this farm was south of  Maiden Lane, and the valley occupied by  the last named street was probably the  marsh referred to. In 1653 an action was  brought by an agent of the West Indian  Company to recover the tithes of crops  from the several farmers, among whom was  Gerrit Hendrycksen, and also for their share  of the expense of maintaining the common  fence. The court records state that 'Ger-  rit Hendrycksen says he is willing to pay'  but 'he has no money now'. A reason as  potent in the twentieth century as it was  in the seventeenth. In 1670 there was more  trouble about the fence and Gerrit Hen-  drycksen was again in court. In May. 1662,  Gerrit Hendrycksen was in possession of a  house and lot on the east side of Broadway,  six and four-fifths rods south of Maiden  Lane, for at that time the property between  his and Maiden Lane was sold and the deed  recites that the land conveyed was bounded  on the south by Gerrit Hendrycksen, 'de  blauw boer', or blue farmer. In November  of the same year the plot on the south of     Gerrit Hendrycksen was conveyed to a new  owner and again he is mentioned in the de-  scription as 'de blauw boer.' C)n May 17,  1663, Jan Vinge conveyed to Gerrit Hen-  drycksen the lot which had evidently been  occupied by him for at least a year previ-  ously. The dimensions of the lot so con-  veyed were: On Broadway, six rods, eight  feet ; east side, six rods, nine and one-tenth  feet; north side, twelve and eight-tenths  rods; south side, twelve and eight-tenths  rods. It is apparent that the present sur-  name of Blauvelt was derived from this ref-  erence to Gerrit Hendrycksen as the blue  farmer. It is probable that his farm was for  some reason called the Blue Fields, and  that in this manner the present name of  Blauvelt, the Dutch rendering of the words  blue field, became the family patronymic.  In 1674 Hendrycksen brought suit for an  account due him and in the records of this  he is twice named as 'Gerrit Hendrycksen  Blauboer'. He was among those affected  by the order of the governor and council  in 1673 requiring the owners of houses out-  side the fortifications along Wall street to  demolish their buildings, gardens and or-  chards because they offered protection to  enemies who might attack the city. This  probably led to the settling of the family  on the Tappan Patent, lying in the present  states of New Jersey and New York. There  is no record to show that this order was  complied with, or that indemnity was made  as promised in the order.   Gerrit Hendrycksen made his will No-  vember 28, 1683, and died soon after at the  age of about sixty-one years. His first wife  died about 1678, and he married fsecond)  October 5, 1679, Josyntje Jans, widow of  Peter Wesselszen, and she married (third)  February 3, 1685, Anthony Serley.

She was born 1652,  daughter of Joseph and Annctje (Daniels)  Waldron, and was married, September 20,  1673. His children, all baptized in New York,  were: Marretje, died young; Marretje, April  II, 1676; Jan, January 22, 1679; Hennan,  April 3. 1681 ; Gerrit, mentioned below; An-  netje, June 14, 1685; Joseph, November 20,  1687; Abraham, March 2, 1690; Isaac, April  24, 1692.   (Ill) Gerrit Blauvelt, third son of Hen-  drick and Marretje (VValdron) Hendrycksen  Blauvelt, was baptized April 10, 1683, in New  York. He was a small boy when his parents  settled at Tappan. He resided there until  about 1 7 19. when he removed to Hackensack,  New Jersey.

He married, about 1756-57, Elizabeth fPeeck)  Peck, whose birth or parentage cannot be  found on the records of Hackensack. Schraal-  enberg or Tappan. There is a hiatus in the     SOUTMF.RN N1-:\V YORK     marriage records of Tappan, and it is im-  possible for this reason to give the dates of  many marriages in the families of that sec-  tion. They had children: Tunis (Theunis),  mentioned below; David, born July 29, 1761 ;  Maria, February 24, 1765.

The farm on which he lived, one mile south  of Nanuet village, was devised to his wMfe by  her father. John Ho^enkamp. This farm is  now in possession of her heirs, who still pre-  serve the old deeds conveying the farm to her  ancestors. One tract was conveyed by 'Fred-  erickus Blauvelt of the County of Orange in  the Province of New York Yeoman', to  Mindert Hogenkamp by deed dated June 5th  'in the 28th year of the reign of our sov-  ereign Lord George, the second, by the Grace  of God. of Great Britain, France and Ireland.  King. Defender of the Faith and in the year  of our Lord Christ, one thousand seveij hun-  dred and fifty-five'.

'Com-  missioner of Forfeitures for the Middle Dis-  trict of said State, appointed in pursuance of  an act in the T,egislature of the State, entitled  an act for the speedy sale of the confiscated  and forfeited estates passed the 12th day of     May, 1784' to John Hogenkamp, first. The  latter was also known as John M. Hogen  Kamp, and was a captain in the revolutionary  army. Fifty acres of the farm were conveyed,  December 6, 1796, by Cornelius M. Demarest  to John M. Hogen Kamp, Esq.

Domini  1739.' This will was proved before Cornelius  Cuiper, one of the magistrate judges for our  inferior court of common pleas. The deed is  proved by Johannes Blauvelt, subscribing wit-  ness, and recites that he made oath on the  Holy Evangelis of Almighty God that he,  Myndert Hogen Kamp signed, sealed and de-  livered the instrument to Myndert Hogen  Kamp Jr. The original will of Myndert Ho-  gen Kamp, dated May 5. 1783, is also pre-  served with other papers.

The family of Butler is said to  BUTLER be Irish or Norman-Irish in   origin, although there are in  Cheshire and Yorkshire several old estab-  lished families of the name. They may, how-  ever, have been branches of the great Irish  family. The surname is said to be derived  from the French form with the same meaning,  'Botilcr', meaning a wine merchant or butler.  The king's butler or pincerna regis was an  officer of considerable importance, answering  to the collector of customs in modern ports.  The origin of the great Irish family of Butler  is a vexed one. They have been variously  deduced from Ilerveius, a companion of Wil-  liam the Conqueror — from the illustrious De  Clares — and from a brother of Thomas a  Becket, the archbishop of Canterbury. The  name, however, is a corruption of the Norman  French term applied to the office of the king's  butler, which was conferred upon Theobald,  surnamed 'le botiler'. by Henry II.. and re-  mained hereditary in his descendants for  many generations. In those centuries the up-  per classes of England were French-speaking.  and were largely Norman in blood, and the  surnames dating from that time are either  purely French in origin, or are .^nglo-Saxon  terms that have been given a slightly French  turn.   The ancestors of the Butlers, on the pater-  nal side, crossed to Ireland in the twelfth cen-  tury, and sought alliances with the Milesian  houses of their own station, transmitting the  family name to their descendants in both a  Norman and a Gaelic form. In the thirteenth  century what is now called Tipperary was  formed into the 'county palatine of Ormond  under the Butlers, who thus became so pow-  erful, that different branches of them'', says  'O'Hart's Pedigrees.', 'furnished manv of tlie  most distinguished families in Ireland'. The  Butlers were earls, marquises and dukes of  Ormonde. Their war cry, which also became  their motto, as in many Gaelic families, was  'Butler Abu !', 'abu' or 'aboo' being the  Iri=h or Gaelic word for 'victory'. Their arms  ncc'rding to the description given in 'O'Hart's  Pedigrees' were: Arms: Or. a chief inflent-     ed azure. Crest: In a ducal coronet, or, a  plume of five ostrich feathers; ar, a falcon  arising out of the last. In the case of the  English families bearing the name the patron-  ymic has probably been derived in a simi-  lar way from the Norman French word de-  noting occupation. Possibly too in America  there are families of French origin among the  Butlers, whose name was originally 'Botiler'',  which became anglicised into Butler.   (I) Justice Butler, ancestor of the Butler  family, lived in New Haven, Connecticut,  where he was probably born about 1760. He  was in all likelihood a descendant of Deacon  Richard Butler, who came to this country in  1633, supposedly from Braintree, county Es-  sex, England. Richard became a freeman at  Cambridge, Massachusetts, May 14, 1634, and  a member of the Rev. Thomas Hooker's  church at Hartford, Connecticut, in 1642.  With his brother, William, he was among the  first settlers at Hartford, receiving sixteen  acres of land there in the first division. He  was a deacon in the first church there and  occupied successively the positions of juror,  selectman, deputy to the general court, and  clerk of the general court. He lived in Hart-  ford on the south side of the Little river, and  owned a house, lot and other lands in Weath-  ersfield. He was twice married, the name of  his first wife remaining unknown, and he  married (second') Elizabeth Bigelow. before  coming to Hartford. She died February z6,  1656; he died August 6. 1684. The inventory  of his estate amounted to six hundred and  fifty-four pounds, fifteen shillings. They had  eight children, five of them sons, all born at  Hartford. It is probable that Justice Butler  was sprung from one of these sons of Richard  Butler, though the most diligent research up  to the present has not succeeded in establish-  ing the connection. Justice Butler married  Lucv Davis.   (IF) Henry, son of Justice and Lucy  (Davis^i Butler, was born in New Haven,  Connecticut, about 1785. He continued to  live in New Haven, where he appears to have  made a prominent fisrure in mercantile circles.  Later he lived in Richmond. Virginia. He  married, in 1807. at New Haven. Rebecca,  born in New Haven, in 1788, daughter of  Samuel Green, born in 1744, died in 17OQ, and  his wife, Abigail CBuelli Green, born in Kil-  lingworth, Connecticut, in 1749, died in Rich-     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     255     mond, Virginia, in 1819. Abigail Buell was  descended in the fourth generation from Wil-  liam Buell, the American pioneer, and patri-  arch of the family. William Buell, Bewelle,  or Beville, was born in Chesterton, Hunting-  donshire, England, about 1610. Emigrating  to America as early as 1630, he settled first  in Dorchester, Massachusetts, and then in  1633 joined the first company that went west-  ward to found the town of Windsor. He  died in Windsor in 1681. His son, Samuel  Buell, was born in Windsor in 1641, and after  1664 lived in Killingworth. where he died in  1720. In the old records he is especially set  down as 'gentleman', was an extensive land  owner, and was honored by his fellow citizens  by election to many positions of trust and  responsibility. By his marriage in 1662 to  Deborah Griswold, who was born in 1646,  died in 171Q, Samuel Buell allied himself to  another of the great colonial families of Con-  necticut. His wife was a daughter of Edward  Griswold, of \\^indsor, brother of Governor  Matthew Griswold. The Griswold family is  descended from Humphrey Griswold, of  Greet, Lord of the Manor. Their ancestors  came originally from Cambridgeshire, where  they were established as early as 1135. The  grandparents of .Abigail Buell, and the an-  cestors in the fifth generation of Rebecca  Green, were Beniamin Buell, of Killingworth,  who was born in 1686, died in 1725, and  Hannah Hutchinson, of Hebron, whom he  married in 1710 Her parents were John  Buell, born in Killineworth in 1717, died  in 1752, and Abigail (Chatfield) Buell,  daughter of John Chatfield. Several of the  sons of Henrv and Rebecca (Green) Butler  have occupied commandine positions in the  commercial and professional life of New York  City. The eldest son. George B., who was  born in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1809,  died in New York in i88fi, is still remembered  as one of the proprietors of the Nm' York  Journal of Commerce, and secretary and at-  torney of the Hudson River Railroad Com-  pany. His son, George Butler, was the dis-  tinguished artist, one of the foremost Ameri-  can painters of his generation. Charles E. is  mentioned below.   (HI) Charles E., son of Henry and Re-  becca ('Green) Butler, was born in Richmond,  \'ir?inia. in tSi8, died in the city of New  York, May i, 1807. He began the study of     the law in 1836 in the office of Jonathan Pres-  cott Hall, in New York City. When he was  twenty-four years old. in association with Wil-  liam M. Evarts he formed the law firm of  Butler & Evarts, whose successors are now  the firm of Evarts, Choate & Sherman. Re-  tiring from professional work in 1879, h^  spent most of his time after that upon his  estate in Stockbridge. Massachusetts. He  married Louisa Clinch, sister of Cornelia  Clinch, who became the wife of Alexander T.  Stewart, the great merchant prince. Mrs.  Louisa (Clinch) Butler died in 1852. Chil-  dren : Prescott Hall, mentioned below ; Max-  well Evarts: Rosalie, died in 1897; Helen C. ;  Virginia; Lilian, married John Swann.   (IV) Prescott Hall, son of Charles E. and  Louisa (Clinch) Butler, was born on Staten  Island, New York, March 8, 1848. He ob-  tained his preparatory education at Reid and  Hoffman's school at Stockbridge, Massachu-  setts, and was graduated at Harvard College  in i86g. Having studied law in his father's  office he was admitted to the bar in 1874, and  entered his fathers' firm, then Evarts, South-  mayd & Choate.

The Wait family is of French ori-  WAIT gin, and the name was spelled   Wight. They were among the  earliest settlers of the Isle of Wight, and were  obliged to surrender the island to the Romans      in the year 43. Though the name was found  in other counties of England, the ancestors  of the American branch were identified with     Somersetshire, where Samuel Wait was a gen-  tleman of good position and estate.   (II) Samuel (2), second son of Samuel  ( I ) Wait, of Somersetshire, England, was,  according to the English law of primogeniture,  left to his own resources when his elder  brother. Thomas, came into the estate. En-  tirelv dissatisfied with this arrangement, Sam-  uel Wait, whose means exceeded $50,000. emi-  grated to America in 1821, and settled iri New-  burg, New York, and later in Montgomery,  Orange county. New York, where he purchas-  ed a farm of one hundred and forty-eight acres  near Neelytown, afterwards purchasing other  farms and becoming a large property owner.  The early part of the nineteenth century saw,  in England, that great religious awakening led  liy the Wesleys, which gave rise to what is  known in this country as the Methodist Epis-  copal church. Among the converts made by  that great and ardent spirit, John W'esley, was  Samuel Wait, who like many another threw  himself heart and soul into the movement and  became one of that great army of lay preach-  ers tlirougfh whom the faith was spread. He  brought his religious enthusiasm with him to  the new country, and was the founder of the  Methodist church at Montgomery, in which  place he resided until his death. He married,  prior to leaving Somersetshire, England,  Mary Walsh of that countv. Their sons  were: Edward, Samuel, John, W'illiam.  Thomas, the two first named having been im-  porters of cattle and sheep, importing the first  .Southdown sheep in America, and the third  having been a large real estate owner in New-  burg. Their daughters were : Mary, married  Charles Downing, of Newburg. New York,  the noted pomologist; Emma, married a Mr.  Bradbury, a broadcloth manufacturer of Ly-  ons. Connecticut ; Flora, married a Mr. Bagg,  a planter and slave holder of Kentucky; Sarah,  married a Mr. Smith, of Montgomery, New  York.

His early  education was gained at one of the many ex-  cellent private boarding schools on the Hud-  son near his home. After he left school he  went to New York City and there took up the  study of medicine and dentistry, where after  only eight months' study he was made first  assistant to the college professor. He finished  the required four-year course in dentistry in  eighteen months, receiving his diploma the fol-  lowing year. In 1884 he left New York City  and opened an office in Goshen, New York,  where he remained for eighteen months. He  then went to Chicago, Illinois, remaining, how-  ever, but a short time, returning to Newburg,  New York, where he began the practice of  dentistry which he has carried on with ever  increasing success to the present time. Dr.  Wait has always been a student of physics,  and has a marked mechanical talent. He is  the inventor of various electrical appliances  in successful use. His device for the inter-  locking of large steel girders without the use  of bolts or rivets was put to the test at Co-  lumbia University in 191 1, and showed one  hundred per cent of practical advantage over  the old method. He was the delegate of New  York state for three years to the International  Association of Manufacturers and Inventors,  now known as the Manufacturers' Associa-  tion. Dr. Wait has also contributed to the  technical magazines a number of scientific ar-  ticles in several fields of natural science, and  has lectured upon those topics before audi-  ences at Columbia, Lehigh and other universi-  ties.

Mrs. Wait was wide-  ly known for her charitable work. She was  a most devout Christian and an enthusiastic  missionary worker, a member of the Fifth  Avenue I'resbyterian Church, New York City.  She was deeply interested in the remodelling  of St. Luke's Hospital at Newburg, giving  upwards of $50,000 to that purpose, erecting  the south wing as a memorial to her father,  Samuel Trevor Knapp. She died in February,  1912.   General John Aaron Rawlins, father of  Emily S. (Rawlins) Wait, was born at East  Galena, Illinois, February 13, 1831, son of  James Dawson Rawlins, a native of Madison  county, Kentucky, who removed to Missouri,  and from there to East Galena, and a de-  scendant of Robert Rawlings, an early settler  of Maryland.   The family removed to Guilford, Illinois,  where John A. Rawlins attended school and  assisted with the work of the farm and in  burning charcoal. He attended Mount Mor-  ris Seminary, 1852-53, studied law in Galena,  1854-55, practiced in partnership with Isaac  P. Stevens, his preceptor, 1855-56, and with  David Sheean, 1858-61. He was elected city  attorney for Galena in 1857 ; was a Democratic  candidate for presidential elector in i860, and  held a series of joint discussions with Allen  C. Fuller, the Lincoln and Hamlin candidate  for elector from his district, which gave him  a local reputation as a public speaker. On the  firing of Fort Sumter in April, 1861, he aided  in arousing the people of Illinois to the dan-  gers that threatened the LInion and in recruit-  ing the Fortv-fifth Illinois Volunteers. He  was appointed aide-de-camp to General Grant,  w^ho had been attracted to him by hearing him  speak at Galena in favor of maintaining the  Union, and although the youngest member of  his stafif, was promoted assistant adjutant-  general, with the rank of captain, September  15, 1861, at Cairo, his commission dating from  August 31, i86t. The only time he was ab-  sent from stafif duty during the entire war  was in August and September, 1864. when on     258     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     sick leave.

He married (second) in  1863, Mary E., daughter of S. A. Hurlburt,  of IJanburv, Connecticut.     This is one of the numer-  VAN ETTEN ous Dutch names which was   derived from the jjlace of  residence of the family. All the names be-  ginning with 'van' are place names, indicating  the town in Holland from which the ancestor  came. Many names having this form were  changed after arrival in this country by the  occu])ation of the individual, such as Smith.  The Terhune family took its name in this  country from the fact that one of its members  either maintained a fine garden or lived near  one. The ancestor was called Albert Albert-  sen. The history of the old Dutch names is  very interesting and easily followed when one  is familiar with the habits and characteristics  of the pioneers of New Amsterdam (New  York). The family of Van Etten has been  idcntifiefl with the history of this state from a  very early period and has since been conspic-  uous in New Jersey and other states.

The spelling of this name was   THRALL much varied in the early days,  the records giving it as Thrale,  Thrall, Trail and Thrall. The family was  identified with the early settlement of Wind-  sor, Connecticut, where it still has many prom-  inent descendants and has spread from there  through various regions of the United States.   (I) William Thrall was born in England in  1605, and in 1630 became a member of the  Congregational church, which was formed in  Plymouth, England, under the ministry of  Rev. John Wareham. On March 20, of that  year, a company set out from Plymouth in the  'Mary and John' and were put ashore at  Nantasket Point, Massachusetts. May 30 Mr.  Wareham and the larger part of his congre-  gation settled at Windsor, Connecticut, in  1635, and W'illiam Thrall was probably among  these. lie took an active part in the Pequot  war, and in 1646 purchased land in Windsor.  where he settled with his family. As this  location was distant from any neighbors and  exposed to attacks from the Indians, he was  exempted from the duties of 'watch and  ward,' to which all able-bodied men of the  settlement were liable. This location has ever  since been occupied by his descendants, who  have maintained the reputation of the family  for thrift, industry, public spirit and all that  constitutes good citizenship. He contributed  two shillings and six pence to the Connecti-  cut Relief Fund for the benefit of the poor  in otiicr colonies. His wife, 'Old Goode (y)  Thrall,' died July 30, 1676. They had sons.  Timothy and David.   CII') Timothy, son of \\'illiam Thrall, was  born Julv 25, 1641, in Windsor, where he  lived.

She married, December 15. 1841, Amos Van  Etten. of that town, whom sjie survived, and  died December 11. 1898 (see Van Etten VI).     This name appears to have an  BARCLAY origin like that of Berkeley.   and indeed to be the same  name with a different orthography. We find a  Theobold de Berkeley, probably a scion or off-  shoot of the Anelo-Norman family, settled in  Scotland, as early as the time of David I.  Fourth in descent from him was Alexander de  Berkeley, who married the heiress of Math-  ers, and wrote himself de Berkeley of     264     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Mathers. His great-grandson, Alexander, ap-  pears to have been the first to use the orthog-  raphy of Barclay in the fifteenth century. The  Berkeleys or Barclays are descended, it is said,  from Thomas de Berkeley of Berkeley Castle,  county Gloucester, England, who lived in the  time of Edward 1., and was the fifth in lineal  succession from Hardinge, a Dane of royal  blood, and one of the companions of the Nor-  man, William, who conquered the Saxons of  England in the eleventh century. Hence the  name and title of Fitz-Hardinge in connection  with the family. Such is the statement made  on the authority of the Peerages, 'though it is  well ascertained,'' says a correspondent of the  (lentleman's Magazine, June, 1846, that the  founders of the house, 'Harding of Bristol  and his son, Robert Fitz-Harding, were only  burghers of that city.' Members of the fam-  ily settled in Scotland and there united with  the old (laelic families, emigrated in time to  county Antrim and other parts of Ireland at  an early date. Others came to America, set-  tling in New Jersey and New York. In the  Friends' records at Rahway, New Jersey, it  is stated that in 1683, after east New Jersey  had come under the control of the proprietors,  Robert Barclay, the author of 'An Apology  for Quakers,' was appointed governor, and  through his influence many of his friends and  relatives migrated from Scotland to New Jer-  sey and settled at Amboy. Among these were  John Reid, George Keith and John Barclay,  the governor's brother. One branch of the  family, which descends from David Bar-  clay, of Ury, Scotland, and his wife, Cath-  arine, daughter of Sir Robert Gordon, trace  their ancestry through John Barclay, son of  David. The Barclay arms of this family are:  A dove with an olive branch. Motto : 'Arms  give wav to peace.'   (I) Dr. Alexander Barclay, first ancestor  in America of the Barclay family here dealt  with, was born in Scotland, died in Newburgh,  Orange county. New York. He was a phy-  sician, and attended a medical college in Scot-  lanri. eoing through the full course. He mar-  ried in Scotland. Mary J. Frascr Watt, and  they came to America in iR,^;. settling in  Newbureh. where he practiced his profession.  (U) Peter M.. son of Dr. Alexander and  Mary J. Fraser (Watt') Barclay, was born in  Aberdeen. Scotland, April 20. 18,^4, died at  Newburgh, Orange county. New York, Feb-     ruary 10, 1 901. Of the physicians and sur-  geons of Orange county, who built up an ex-  tensive practice, Dr. Barclay was one 01 the  chief. In Newburgh he received his prelim-  inary education, graduating from the Academy  in 1848. In 1850 he began the study of med-  icine under his father, and graduated from  the University of New York in 1854. Gover-  nor Fenton on July 9, 1866, appointed ium  surgeon to the Nineteenth Infantry of New  York with the rank of captain. Dr. Barclay  was a non-resident member of the Medico-  Legal Society of New York and was promi-  nently identified with the Masonic fraternity,  including the Knights Templar. Of Dr. Bar-  clay's skill in his profession much has been  said. His talents were known and appreciated  for nearly half a century in Newburgh and  the adjoining portions of the state. He was  recognized as a leading citizen, performing in  a plain and courteous manner the various  social and professional duties that devolved  on him. His death was generally mourned  among a large circle of friends. He married,  June 19, 1872, Harriet E., daughter of Captain  C. B. and Annie Marie (Coleman) Arm-  strong. They had one daughter, Maude, who  married Senator John B. Rose, a leading brick  manufacturer and representative citizen of  Newburgh. Children of Captain and Mrs.  .'\rmstrong: Harriet E.. Anna H., married  Robert Rogers, and William H. H.   This name is of German origin,  LVDIG and was brought to this country  about the middle of the eighteenth  century. Since that time it has been con-  spicuously identified with commercial mat-  ters in New York City, where a representative  of the present generation is actively engaged  today.   (I) The founder of the American family  of this name was Philip Eydig, who was born  at Schwab Hall, in Germany. 1723. He came  to .\merica about 1750, settling first in Phil-  adelphia, where he engaged in business as a  erain merchant. In 1735 he removed to New  York, and his residence was at the southeast  corner of Ferry and Gold streets. The house  was standing until recent times, an interesting  relic of the past. A narrator of the events  of the past describes Mrs. Lydig as 'a fair-  faced, healthy, handsome old lady, with her  plain cap, scrupulously neat dress, and of dis-      y^£'^     ^a!<^c^'     rw^'*;>^     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     26=     tinguished manner, sitting in the summer  afternoon on the old Dutch stoop in front of  her house.'' Her husband was one of the lead-  ing members of the Lutheran church, which  stood in 'Skinners street' (now a part of  Cliff street). This edifice became too small  for the increasing membership, and in 1766  Mr. Lydig, with Jacob Grimm, purchased lots  on the corner of Frankfort and William  streets, and here was erected that quaint edi-  fice known as the 'Swamp Church,' views of  which are given in most histories of the city.  During the revolution this church was at-  tended by the Hessian soldiers, and their lib-  eral contributions were of the greatest assist-  ance in maintaining its service. Some of the  officers of the Hessians who died in the city  were buried in the graveyard attached to the  church, and in later years their remains were  discovered as they were laid to rest, 'in all  the panoply of war.' When the church was  built it is said that Mr. Lydig, its principal  founder, went to Germany and was success-  ful in obtaining pecuniary assistance for the  ])urpose. Mr. Lydig continued his business  during the war as a flour merchant, and accu-  mulated a substantia! fortune. He died be-  fore the close of the revolution, and was  buried in the church which he founded. He  married Margaret Egbert, a widow, daughter  of Peter Grimm, a German merchant, who also  came from Swabia. Mrs. Lydig survived her  husband many years. Two children : David,  of whom further: and Sabina, born 1765.  David Grimm, brother of Mrs. Lydig, was a  man to whose knowledge of early New York  every historian and antiquarian is most deeply  indebted.   (H) David, son of Philip Lydig, was born  1763. He was in later years one of the most  prominent and prosperous citizens of New  York. He was very truth fullv described as 'a  man of good education, carefully brought up,  handsome in person, of good sense and judg-  ment, refined and courteous in manner.' He  was a leading member of The Club, which  consisted of about thirty prominent citizens,  which met at the houses of the members in  succession. Among the portions of his ex-  tended estate were mills situated at Butter-  milk Falls. This pronertv he sold at the time  of the completion of the Erie canal, as he fore-  saw the competition of the western part of  the state, and by this he saved a large amount.     In New York he was a director of the Mer-  chants' Bank, which was incorporated m 1805.  At various times he became the owner of many  pieces of real estate. At the beginning of his  career as a merchant he resided at No. 21  Peck Slip, living over his store, as was the  custom of those days. From thence he re-  moved to No. 55 Beekman street. In the days  of his well-merited prosperity his home was  at No. 225 Broadway, being the second house  from Barclay street. This house and lot he  purchased from Jonathan Fisk in 1818. The  price was twenty-five thousand two hundred  and fifty dollars. When John Jacob Astor  was planning to erect the Astor Mouse, in  1831, he purchased the house and lot of Mr.  Lydig for thirty-two thousand five hundred  dollars. Mr. Lydig then purchased the house  No. 34 Leight street, which was then an aris-  tocratic neighborhood, and here he resided for  the remainder of his life. The newspapers of  the time contained the following notice : 'Died,  on Tuesday morning, May the i6th. 1840, in  the seventy-sixth year of his age, David Lydig,  an old and respectable merchant of this city.'   We cannot better conclude this sketch than  by giving extended extracts from the diary of  Philip Hone, the 'Gentleman Mayor' of New  York :   'June 18, 1839. I went out yesterday with my  wife and daughter to dine with my old friends, the  Lydig?. at West Farms, and had a truly delightful  day. The heautiful grounds on Bronx river are in  fine order, and such a profusion of roses and other  flowers I have scarcely ever seen. We had an excel-  lent dinner, Lydig's fine old wines, and abundance  of delicious strawberries, with a welcome hearty as  the one and unstinted as the other. Mr. and iMrs.  Li-vingston, with some of their family were of the  party. Lydig and Suydam are both in indifferent  health, and the latter dreadfully hipped and prone  to water drinking. But our gossiping about old  times, and good cheer and lovelv scenerv, set the  old gentlemen on their legs for the time being, and  both, I am persuaded, went to bed much better than  thev have been for a twelvemonth. So much for  the innocent enjoyments, which this world, bad as  we think it. affords.   'May 16. 1840. Another link is broken in the chain  of social relations. Another warning given of the  passing away of my generation. My o!d and valued  friend, David Lydig. died this morning at six o'clock.  He has been in bad health the last two years, but  had rallied of late, and appeared to be gaining  strength, until his last illness. He died in the  seventy-sixth year of his age. much older than I. but  an intimate friend and associate for nearlv fortv  years. He was one of a set who. although my  seniors, were verv intimate companions about the  time of my entrance into society, and with whom I     266     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     continued in pleasant association until they drifted  away one by one, and now I am about the only one  left. How many good dinners I have eaten at poor  Lydig's expense, and how many hours .1 liavc passed  in his society. He was a just man, prudent and  careful in the management of his affairs, unexcep-  tionable in his deportment, with some old-fashioned  aristocratic notions, an exceedingly good liver, fond  of old wines, which, however, he drank in modera-  tion, but less prudent in the enjoyment of the other  pleasures of the table. He was, in short, a gentle-  man of the old school, a race which is nearly extinct,  so, as the old ones decayed and died off, their places  are supplied by an undergrowth less hardy, majestic  and graceful.'   Mr. Lydig tnarricd Catherine Me.sier, a  member of one of the oldest Dutch families  of New York. Their child, Philip Mesier, of  whom further.   (Ill) Philip Mesier, only child of David  and Catherine (Mesier) Lydig, was born in  1799. In 1824 he entered into partnership with  his father under the firm name of David Lydig  & Son. their place of business being at No.  160 South street. For nearly a half century  he was connected with nearly every bank and  insurance company in the city, and he was  recognized as one of the most prominent busi-  ness men of his time. Among the various  pieces of property owned by Mr. Lydig were  the famous Lydig mills on the Bronx river.  In 1680 the town of Westchester granted to  William Richardson the privilege of erecting  mills at this place. They afterwards passed  into the hands of Everet Byvanck, and were  known for long years as 'Byvanck's Mills.'  His widow sold them to W'illiam Provoost in  171 1.' three grist mills and a saw mill.' He  sold thetn to Stephen De Lancey, and from his  heirs they were purchased by David Lydig.  Through the estate of Mr. Lydig the Bronx  ran for nearly a mile, and it was one of the  finest country residences in Westchester  county. This tract is now the Zoological Gar-  dens.   Philip Mesier Lydig married Katherine,  eldest daughter of John Suydam, a member of  one of the oldest Knickerbocker families. They  were the parents of seven children: T. Philip  Mciscr. of whoin further. 2. David, marrietl  Hannah Tomokins, and is now living in New  York. 3. Maria, married Judge Charles P. Daly.  4.

Rosalie,  wife of John J. Staples. 7. Florence, married  Frank K. Sturgis. ex-president of the New  York Stock Exchange.   (IV) Colonel Philip Mesier (2) Lydig, eld-  est son of Philip Mesier (i) and Katherine  (Suydam) Lydig, was born in New York  City, in 1837. Graduating from the Columbia  Law School in i86r, he entered upon the prac-  tice of his profession, but the otitbreak of the  civil war changed the tenor of his life. Among  the first to enlist in the service of his country,  he was commissioned captain and aide-de-  camp, United States Volunteers, January 9,  1862, and served on the stafT of Brigadier-Gen-  eral J. G. Parke, commanding the Third Brig-  ade in Bnrnside's expedition, and was attached  to the Third Division. Department of North  Carolina. In this position he remained until  July. 1862. He was then with the Third Divi-  sion of the Ninth Army Corps of the Army of  the Potomar to September of the same year,  and -was with General Parke of the staff of  General Burnside from September to Novem-  ber. 1862. and continued under the same com-  mander until March. 1864. On March 18.   1864. he was commissioned maior and assist-  ant adjutant-general.

He  entered Harvard University, p'raduating in  1880. During the war with Snain he was  commissioned captain bv President McKinley,  May 17, 1897. and served as chief commis-  sary, artillery brigade, and as chief and pur-  chasing commissary at Honolulu.

Returning to New  York, Mr. Lydig engaged in business as a  banker and broker, being the senior partner  of the firm of Lounsbery & Company, with  offices on Broad street.

He is a member of the  New York Stock Exchange and of various  clubs, including the Knickerbocker, Union,  Metropolitan, Racquet and Tennis, South Side  Sportsmen's, and the Metropolitan of Wash-  ington. He is a member of the Society of  Foreign Wars, Military Order of the Loyal  Legion, Spanish-American War Society, and  Holland Lodge. No. 8, Free and y\ccepted  Masons, of New York.

Mrs. Lydig's father was a  well-known merchant of Havana and New  York.     The family name of Erskine  ER.SKINE is also found in the forms of  Erskin, Ayerskin, Harskin,  Earskin and Harkin. Lower says that the  name was derived from the barony of Erskine  on the river Clyde in Scotland, and that it was  first assumed by Henry of Erskine about the  vear 1220. On the other hand, the name was  probably applied to the barony, which is situ-  ated in Renfrewshire, by an early Celtic clan,  according to the Gaelic fashion, which usually  gave places names derived-^rom their own  patronymics or family names, in contradis-  tinction to the custom among the later Nor-  mans, who derived their names mostly from  places with which they were connected. Pos-  sibly the custom arose amonsr the Celts of  applying to places the name thcv themselves  bore or the name the head of the clan bore,  from the fact that in those early times places  had no names at all. These are easily recog-  nized when it is recollected that the earliest  civilization of Europe when history dawned  '•as that of the Celts, under whom Eurone  formed a loose Celtic empire, of which Gaelic  was the language. The Gauls whom Caesar  encountered in France were Gaels, and Gallia  or Gaul or France was the land of the Gael.  The probability is, therefore, that Erskine was  first a Celtic clan name, then the name of a  place, and finally became a Norman-Celtic  patronymic. O'Hart in his 'Pedigrees' de-     268     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     scribes the Erskine arms as : Ar. a pale sable  a mullet on a crescent for diff., and gives the  following portion of the Erskine pedigree:  (1) John Erskin (modernized Erskine), Earl  of Mar. (II) Alexander, his third son. (Ill)  Sir James (his son). Knight of the Bath at  King James' Coronation, died in Dublin,  March 5, 1636; married Mary, daughter and  co-heir of Adam Erskin, of Chambuskeneth ;  was buried in St. Michael's Church, Dublin.  ( IV) Robert Erskin. married Anne Mutray.   (1) Christopher Erskin. or Erskine. the im-  migrant ancestor of the Erskine family, was  born in Ireland in the year 1701, died at  Abingdon (Bridgewater) Massachusetts, April  i9» '775- ^^^ spent his youth in Ireland, and  came to this country unmarried when a young  man in 1725. It has been supposed that his  ancestors were kinsmen of the earls of Mar,  whose family was also Erskine, and that they  lived sometimes in Ireland, and sometimes in  Scotland, according to the swaying of the for-  tunes of the cause with whicli they were con-  nected. There is not very much in the records,  nor has much been carried to us by family  tradition indicating his business or profession.  It is very likely that he engaged in the pioneer  work of the time, which was mainly agricul-  tural. Po.ssibly he landed at Plymouth, and  after visiting several places with a view to  settlement, finally pitched his tent at Abing-  don, married, and made his home there for the  remainder of his life. He married, at Abing-  don (Bridgewater), Massachusetts, Susanna,  born in 1714, died August 19, 1789, daughter  of Gain or Gains Robinson. Christopher was  then twentv-eight years old. and his wife was  then but fifteen. She lived for fourteen years  after her husband, and slabs to the memory  of both arc still said to be standing in the  old burial ground at Bridgewater. Gains or  Gain Robinson was also from Ireland, and  landed at Plvmouth. lived at Braintree. Pem-  broke, and finally at East Bridgewater, and  had recommendations from churches in Ire-  land, Braintree and Pembroke. A passage in  the 'History of Bridgewater.' bv Nahum  Mitchell, says of him : 'He also had by a for-  mer wife a son. Archibald, and a daughter,  Susanna, who married Christopher Erskins,  an Irishman, who settled in Abingdon.'' Chil-  dren of Christopher and Susanna (Robinson)  Erskin : Mary, born at Abingdon. Massachu-  setts, in 1730; John, mentioned below; Chris-     topher, Bridgewater, Massachusetts, 1734;  Jeremiah, 1736.

His  name has often been corrupted into Messina,  the name of a famous city in the isle of Sicily,  but he was named after one of Napoleon's  celebrated generals by his father, and that  name afterwards became well known through-  out Wisconsin, when he entered into the  public life of that state. His was the only  branch of the family that left Massachusetts  after John (2). though lately members have  settled in New York. Massena Erskine re-  moved from Massachusetts in 185 1 to Racine,  Wisconsin, where he engaged in business as  one of the four orieinal partners of the T.  I. Case Threshing Machine Company.

He belongs to the St. Anthony Club. He is  an independent in politics, and a Presbyterian  in religion.     The . surname Van  VAN NOSTRAND Nostrand is mani-  festly Holland-Dutch  in origin and became widely known in the New  Netherlands in the seventeenth century. The  records of the Van Nostrand family are to  be found in the archives of New York, Albany,  Jamaica and Oyster Bay. The name had a  number of variation;, such as Noorstrand,  Oorstrand and the like. The family has al-  ways been of the substantial class, and in late  years has given to the country many men of  great ability in commercial and professional  life,   (I) Jacob Jansen Van Nostrandt, first  American ancestor of the New York family  of that name, emigrated to this country in  163S and settled in the colony of Rensselaer-  wyck, where Jacob Jansen Van Nostrandt,  May 21, i6=;2, took the oath to the patroon.  That immediate locality was in the south east-  ern corner of the now Saratoga county, at  a place called 'Halve Maen' or Half Moon,  as his daughter Jannetje on the marriage rec-  ord stated that she was born there. Jacob  Jansen Van Nostrandt was by occupation a  brewer. He obtained a patent for land in  Albany in 1652 as Jacob Jansen Van Nos-  trand^ the brewer: and had a patent for a lot  on the east side of Beaver and South Pearl  streets nine rods by eight and a half. This  plot seems to have been divided into three     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     smaller parcels, numbers one, two and three.  In 1680 Jacob Jansen Van Nostrandt con-  veyed nurnber one to Hendrick Gerritse Van-  der Muelen. On the same block on Beaver  street, and at the other corner adjoining an  alley, on lots five and six, was his brewery,  wnich he sold in 1654 to Rutger Jacobsen,  alias Rut Van VVoert, viz. : Jacob Jansen Van  Noorstran's brewery and lot in Beaver street,  except the Horse Mill and brewer's tools  (nearly opposite the present Middle Dutch  church j. In the year 1656 he was appointed  inspector of beer barrels. The massacre of  the Esopus occurred June 7, 1663, when  Jacob Jansen Van Nostrandt, the brewer, ap-  pears to have been present. In August and  November of that year he was present at the  two baptisms in Kingston as Getuigenis. In  1676 he signed a petition of the inhabitants  of Esopus for a ministry. The Dutch church  was founded in Beverwyck, or now Albany,  about 1640, and was the only one not of  Esopus having a permanent ministry until  1700, save that of Schenectady. He married,  February 20, 1650, Jennetje Jacobse, daugh-  ter of Aaron Jacobsen, widower, who married,  August 16, 1685, Elizabeth Volvinck, widow.  Unfortunately the records of the Albany  church previous to 1684 are missing, or some  particulars of the bajitism of his children  might have been found. From the records of  the Dutch church of Kingston and New York  he appears to have had issue : Jan Jacobse,   married .Agniette ; Jacob Jacobse, married   .'\nnetje Creesvelt ; Aaron Jacobse, mentioned  below : Jannetje Jacobse, married Jacob Hoog-  teeling; Marie Jacobse, married A. V.  Bremen ; Agniet Jacobse ; and possibly Peter  Jacobsen. the miller of Esopus.

In 1693 he  was on the assembly roll in Flatbush. In  March, 1693, he bought two house plots from  Gerardus Bcckman. which he sold May 27.  1704, to Johannes Jansen. In 1678 he was  in the census and is there described as having  five children. April 14, 1707, he and Aeltje  were witnesses in Jamaica at the baptism of a  granddaughter, by name Elizabeth .Mburtis.  In August, 1708, they were also witnesses in  Jamaica at the christening of Jacob .\lburtis.  Aaron J. filed, May 17, 1714, the 'ear-mark'     for his cattle. There is a record, too, dated  June 17, 1714, of a letter written by Will Lake  to George Clark requesting him to pay Aaron  J. Van Nostrand for the construction of a  well in some part of the neighborhood. From  another record it is ascertained that Aaron  J. was a member, September 17, 1715, of Cap-  tain Treadwell's trained band for the vicinity  of Hempstead. June 2, 1726, he was of Fos-  ter's Meadow as per H. T. R.

This surname is usually given as  GRIGGS Scotch in origin, but the bearers   of the name in Washingtonville,  Orange county. New York, are stated to have  come from Germany or Holland. Concerning  the name, August Frederick Pott has this to  say: 'Familiennamen Greger. Graeger, Krag-  ermann, vielleicht aus Gregorius. woraus auch  Engl. Gregorson. Gregson, Grigg, Griggs und  Grocock,' W'hich being interpreted is to the ef-  fect that the German family names Gregor,  Graeger and Kragermann, as well as the Eng-  lish names Gregorson, Gregson, Grigg, Griggs  and Grocock, are derived from the Latin per-  sonal name Gregorius. which was in its turn  derived from the Greek Grcgorios. Pott, who  is the great German authority on surnames, is  mistaken in so far as he believes that Griggs  and its allied names in the United Kingdom  are English in origin. They are really an Eng-  lish rendering of ancient Scotch or Gaelic  names. The well-known personal name of  Gregorius has not only become itself a sur-  name, but has given rise to various others,  especially Gregorson. Gregg, Gregson, Griggs,  Grisfson, Greig, Grix and possibly Grocock.  These forms are mostlv Scotch, and Grier and  Grierson, not to mention Mac Gregor. are  cntirelv so. The familv of Gregorv of War-  wickshire, England, is traced to John Greg-  ory, lord of the manor of Freneley and  Asfordbv. county Leicester, England, in the  thirteenth centurv. Greeg of Northcliffe Hall,  county Chester. England, is reearded as being  descended from the Clan Mac Grcsror of Scot-  land. Kings James VI. and Charles I. issued  edicts against the Clan Gregor. denouncing the  whole clan or sept, and forbidding the use of     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     273     the name. In consequence many of the race  became Campbells, Gregs, Greigs and Griggs,  the termination 'son' or 's' standing for the  Gaelic prefix 'Mac'' (son). It may therefore  be presumed that the tirst ancestor of the Ger-  man or Dutch Griggs in this country bore  some name like Gregers, Graegers, and that  this name became gradually transformed to  the more familiar Griggs. Colonial settlers of  the name of Griggs came to New England to  the number of about ten before the year 1700,  and some of them have been traced bacK to  Scotland, and some as of record in England at  Lavenham and Ipswich, and others of them in  Ireland. One branch of the family bore the  arms thus heraldically described : Gules three  ostrich feathers argent. Crest : A sword in  pale enfiled with a leopard's face proper.   The Griggs family of Massachusetts was  established by Thomas Griggs, of Roxbury  (now Boston), who came with his wife Mary  and sons Joseph and John and daughter Mary,  and was of record as a land owner as early  as 1639 in the town of Roxbury. in the Mas-  sachusetts Bay Colony. Most of the persons  bearing the name of Griggs in America trace  their descent to this Thomas Griggs, of Rox-  bury. The colonial records of New Jersey  mention among the first settlers of the name  Benjamin. Daniel. Samuel and Thomas Griggs.  The present Griggstown was founded by Ben-  jamin Griggs and his brothers on the banks of  the Millstone river, where he settled and built  a grist mill as early as 1733. These four  brothers established the Griggs family in New  Jersey, and their descendants are numerous  and widely scattered through the west.  (I) Alexander Griggs, the immigrant an-  cestor of the Griggs family of Washington-  ville, Orange county. New York, was born in  Baden-Baden. Germany, died in the village of  Marlboro, Ulster county. New York. Soon  after his arrival here he took up patents in  Ulster county, where the village of Marlboro  now stands. He was one of the first to do  so, and soon stood high among the pioneer  settlers of that region. He had several  children. There is some doubt as to his bap-  tismal name, but it is presumed to be Alex-  ander. Little is known as to the details of his  life, but he seems to have been a well-in-  formed man of worthy character, and to have  been a capable agriculturist and business man.  He came to America probably in the year 1712,     and the date of the patent granted to him at  Marlboro is February 14, 1714.   (II) Alexander (2), son of Alexander (ij  Griggs, was probably born in Marlboro, Ulster  county, New York, and died there, having  lived in the same neighborhood nearly all his  life. Even less is known regarding the events  of his career than regarding those of his  father, and there is doubt also as to his real  baptismal name. He was a farmer, engaging  also to some extent in commercial pursuits.  He married and brought up a family of chil-  dren.   (HI) Ferdinand, son- of .Me.xandcr (2)  Griggs, was born about the year 1771 on the  paternal farm at Marlboro. Ulster county,  New York, and died at Milton. Ulster county,  New York. His boyhood was spent in his  native place, and afterwards he took up his  residence at Milton, where he followed black-  smithing and farming, owning at Milton a  tract of land comprising about seventy-five  acres. He was a man of much ability, and  was greatly respected at Milton, where the  ?i eater part of his life was passed. He proved  himself to be a successful agriculturist, work-  ing as far as he could in a scientific and busi-  ness-like way, and in course of time built up a  valuable property. In politics he was an old-  line W'hie. and in religious belief he was a  Presbvterian. He married Elizabeth, daugh-  ter of a Mr. Fowler, who lived about six miles  *'rom Milton, and who was probably descended  from Pennsylvania Quaker ancestry. Chil-  dren : I. Fowler G., who followed farming: in  Cornwall. Orange county, New York. 2. Mar-  tha, married James Halt, who operated the old  familv homestead. 3. Daniel, who died when  he attained his thirtieth year. 4. Harvey H.  mentioned below. 5. Henry Crawford, men-  tioned below. 6. Lewis. 7. Thomas. 8.  Kat'ira Maria, married Samuel Halsey.   (TV) Harvev H., third son of Ferdinand  and Elizabeth (Fowler) Griggs, was born Feb-  ri'arv 13, 1806. on the old homestead at Milton,  New York. He became a well-known farmer  and business man of the county. He showed  a great eagerness for study of a practical kind,  and he made farming his life work: he pros-  pered as an aericulturist, accumulating a con-  siderable propertv, owning eighty-five acres in  Plattekill township and cip-htv acres in Marl-  boro township. His political support was  given to the Whig party in early life, and he     274     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     voted for William Henry Harrison, but on  the organization of the Republican party he  joined its ranks and was ever afterwards one  of its stalwart supporters. In the year 1885  he sold his farm and removed to Poughkeepsie,  where he spent his remaining days. In religion  he was a Methodist, and regularly attended the  services of that church. He married, in 1830,  Susan Smith, who was of Holland-Dutch de-  scent, tracing her ancestry to Peter Stuyvesant.  Her parents were Eben and Susanna (Del-  amater) Smith, residing at Milton, Ulster  county, New York, where the father owned  an extensive farm. There were several mem-  bers of the Smith family who became prom-  inent, including Friend W., a Methodist min-  ister, who twice served as pastor of St. James  church, Kingston; James M., who was a well-  known physician; Jane L., who married Peter  Du Bois, a carpenter of New York. To Har-  vey H. Griggs and his wife were born eight  children, most of whom grew to manhood and  womanhood and had families.   ( I\' ) Henry Crawford, fourth son of Fer-  dinand and Elizabeth (Fowler) Griggs, was  born at Milton, Ulster county. New York, died  March 19, 1902, at Washingtonville, Orange  county. New York. He was educated in the  district schools of Milton, and learned the tan-  ner's trade at Cornwall, Orange county. New  York, where he resided for a period of about  sixteen years. About the year 184 1 he ]iur-  chascd the old Moftatt farm of one hundred  and twelve acres, which he built up into a val-  uable property, holding it for a period of  twenty-five years. In 1869 he went to Wash-  ingtonville, Orange county. New York, and  purchased a home in the neighborhood, where  he lived a retired life until his death. Mr.  Ciriggs came of good stock, and showed the  traits that had distinguished the family from  its first settlement in this country during his  long life, which lasted upwards of ninety years.  He was a man of great ability and decisive  character, but he was content to turn that abil-  ity and the force of his character into the  laborious work connected with an agricultural  life. He was successful in that work, as he  would have made a success of almost any  work to which he might have laid his hand.  Amid the circle of his friends and acquaint-  ances he was respected for his manly qual-  ities of head and heart, for his upright life,  and for the sterling honesty of his character.     He took considerable interest in public affairs  even to the day of his death, and as he had in  early life been a Whig, he joined the Repub-  lican party on its organization, believing firmly  in the principles on which it was formed. He  was a Quaker in religion, and as long as he  was able was a fairly regular attendant at the  Quaker meeting place. He married (first), in  1841, Catherine Sayer. She died in 1853. He  married (second), in 1854, Eliza Har-  court. Children by first marriage : ]Mary Eliz-  abeth ; Martha Hait, married Charles Cooper ;  Louis, married Mary Bodle. Child by second  marriage : Henrietta, married Bradner Cam-  eron. All the children are now living in Wash-  ingtonville, New York.     Like manv of the  SCHOONALVKER Dutch names, this was  not adopted as a  surname until after its arrival in America. Its  descendants have been conspicuously identi-  fied with the history of New- York from a very  early period, and are still found in the lead-  ing occupations and social positions of the  state. It was first founded iit Albany and  thence spread throughout this and other  states.   (I) The first now known was Hendrick  Jochemsen (Schoonmaker), who came to  America from Holland in 1654 in the military  service, Dutch East India Company, as lieu-  tenant and sent to Fort Orange with his com-  pany. He first appears on the -records at  Albany, where he was residing as early as   1654. On April 10, 1655, the authorities at  Albany wrote to Governor Stuyvesant that  Hendrick Jochemsen, with others, had ad-  vanced money to the governor in time of need  in the ])revious year, and requested him to  make restitution, or forward a duly executed  oblisjation. as he had promised to do. Hen-  drick Jochemsen owned a lot on the east course  ■)f State street and Broadway, in Albany,  which he sold to .\braham Staats. In April.   1655. he bought for three florins the sign of  Stephen Janse Conick. an innkeeper, there-  upon he engaged in the business of keeping an  inn. and during the same year was lieutenant  of the Burgher Company. In April of the  same year the farming out of the wine and  strong beer excise was sold at public sale at  the house of Hendrick Jocheinsen Schoon-  maker. On June tR, 1659, he bought a gar-     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     2/5     den in Beaverwyck, behind Fort Orange,  which had been patented to Jan Roeloffse in  1654. July 16, 1659, Hendrick Jochemsen  bought at pubHc sale a blue coat for forty-two  florins. July 20, 1661, he sold his house and  lot outside of Fort Orange, and on June 19,  1666, he sold his garden to Philip Peter Schuy-  ler, and July 12, 1669, he sold his house in  Albany to Abraham Staats. He enlisted when  Governor Stuyvesant called for recruits to sub-  due the Indians at Esopus, and proceeded to  that place in 1659. He appears in the rec-  ords, March 28, 1660, as a soldier in the  'Netherlandish service in the company of his  Noble Honor, the Director General,' then  stationed at Esopus (Kingston). Soon after  this the governor curtailed the military estab-  lishment and induced several of the soldiers  to settle at Esopus by giving them grants of  land. Among these was Hendrick Jochemsen  Schoonniaker. He appears as a resident of  W'iltwyck (Kingston), October 24. 1661, pay-  ing an excise tax of seventy-five florins, and  in the following year. No. i of the 'new lots'  was assigned to him. May 30, 1662, the mil-  itia was organized with Hendrick Jochemsen  as lieutenant. At the massacre and burning  of Kingston, June 7, 1663, he took an active  part in the defence against the savages ; was  twice wounded while defending his house at  the first onset. He fought bravely until the  arrival of Captain Chambers, and the Indians  were put to rout and the gates closed. At  this time his eldest son, Jochem Hendrick. was  captured by the Indians. When the English  gained possession of the Dutch colony in New  York, and stationed soldiers at Kingston, a  very natural friction arose between the resi-  dents and the garrison, and Lieutenant Hen-  drick Jochemsen was a leader in the demon-  stration known as the 'Esopus Meeting of  1667.' \\'ith him were all the Burgher guard  arraved in arms. Captain Chambers of the  guard being an Englishman naturally refused  to take side with the Bursrhers, and ordered  them to disarm and return to their homes.  This demonstration had been precipitated bv  the arrest and imprisonment of Cornelis Bar-  entsen Sleight, who afterwards married the  widow of Hendrick Jochemsen. At the time  of the latter's marriage to her she was Elsie  Tanse Brustede, widow of Adrian Pietersen  Van Alemer, and the marriage probably took  place a few years before his removal to King-     ston. He is said to have died in 1681. She  was the daughter of Jan Jansen Breestede and  Engeltje Janse Van Breestede. Children of  Hendrick Jochemsen Schoonmaker : Jochem  Hendrick, Egbert, Engeltje (Angelina), Hil-  litje, Volkeet.   (II) Jochem Hendrick Schoonmaker, eldest  son of Hendrick Jochemsen and his wife Elsie,  was born in 1658 at Fort Orange, and became  one of the pioneer settlers of what is now the  town of Rochester, Ulster county. New York.  In 1703 he was one of the three trustees of  the patent on which the settlement was made  and remained in that connection until his death  in 1713. From 1709 to 1712 he was supervisor  of the town of Rochester, and was captain of  a volunteer military company raised for de-  fence against the Indians. He married (first),  August I, 1679, Petronella Sleight, daughter  of Barentsen Sleight and his wife, Tryntje  Tysee Boz. She died before 1689. He mar-  ried (second). April 26, 1689, Ann, daugh-  ter of Frederick and Margaret (Boz) Hussey.  There were two children of first wife: Cor-  nelius Barentsen and Hendrick. Children of  second wife: Rebecca, Frederick, Jan, Mar-  sraret, Jacob, Jochem, Benjamin, Antje, Sarah,  Daniel.   (III) Cornelius Barentsen, eldest child of  Jochem Hendrick and Petronella (Sleight)  Schoonmaker, was born January 15. 1682, in  Rochester, where he passed his life, and died  October 14, 1757. He married, December 19,  171 1, Engeltje Roosa. of Hurley, baptized Sep-  tember 3, 1685, in Kingston, granddaughter of  Albert Heymans Roosa (see Roosa). Arie,  eldest son of Albert H. Roosa, was born in  Holland before 1650, probably as early as 1645,  and came with his father to America. His  name appears on the list of those who took  the oath of allegiance in Ulster county, Sep-  tember I. t68o. and he was captain of a foot  company in that place. In 1686. with five  others, he received a errant of land along the  east side of the Hudson river opposite the  mouth of Rondout creek, and there he subse-  nuentlv made his home. This was first called  the Arie Roos? Patent and is now Rhinebeck.  He married Maria Pels, daughter of Magis-  trate Evert Pels and his wife, Jannetje  Svmens. Children : Jannetje, born about  1670, Evert, baptized October 26. 1679 ; Weyn-  tie, June 4. 1682; Engeltje, above mentioned;  .^nnetje, December 22, 1687; Arrien, June 3,     276     SOUTHERX NEW YORK     1694; Mary, August 28, 1698. Children of  Cornelius B. Sciioonmaker: Catryntjen, bap-  tized October 12, 1712; Petronclla, June 3,  1716: Cornelius, June 25. 1721 ; Elizabeth,  May 7, 1727.   ( I\ ) Cornelius, only son of Cornelius Bar-  entsen and Engeltje ( Roosa ) Schoonmaker,  settled on a large tract of land on the north  line of the town of Shawangunk, which he  purchased from the James Henderson Patent.  and which lay south of and adjoining the  Zachariah Hottman Patent. He died there  January 21, 1778, leaving three sons and a  daughter. As he died intestate the law at that  time provided that his eldest son receive the  estate. Deeds on record show that the latter  was magnanimous with his brothers and made  a division of the real estate with them, in con-  sideration that they maintain their mother dur-  ing her life and pay a certain sum to their  sister Maria. This division of the real estate  was made bj' a commission consisting of Jo-  hannes Bruyii and James Kain. He married.  May 22. 1746. Arriantie flornbeck, a native  of Rochester township. Children : Cornelius  C, mentioned below ; Abraham, mentioned be-  low, with descendants ; Isaac and Maria, bap-  tized December 31. 1749, at Kingston.   (Y) Cornelius C, eldest son of Cornelius  and Arriantie (Hornbeck) Schoonmaker. was  born in Shawangunk. and received the estate  of his father as above noted. He was an  intelligent and prosperous farmer and was  also a surveyor. He was a member of the  first assembly gathered under the state con-  stitution, which met at Kingston in 1777 and  continued in that service during eleven ses-  sions, including the year 1790. He w-as a  member of the committee of safety during  the revolution. In the latter year he was  elected a member of the second United States  congress, and in 1795 was again a member of  the state legislature. The convention of 1778.  which adopted the constitution for the state,  counted him amone its members. He mar-  ried CfirsP) Sarah Hoffman, probably a daugh-  ter nf Zachariah Hoffman, proprietor of the  HnfTman Patent. He married ('second') at  Kingston. July 4. 1759, Arriantie Terwilliger.  Thev had a son, Jacob, baptized July T2, 1761,  at Kingston.   (VJ) Zachariah, youngest child of Cornel-  ius C. and Arriantje f Terwilliger) Schoon-  maker, was born about 1782 in Shawangunk.     He became a prominent citizen of Kingston,  New York. He graduated from Union Col-  lege, read law, was admitted to the bar, and  practiced his profession in Kingston, New  York, until his death in 18 18. He married.  November 29, 1808, at Kingston, Cornelia  Marius. daughter of Peter Marius Groen, who  was a great-grandson of Jacob Marius Groen,  who went from Holland to England in 1670  and there married Letitia, daughter of Ad-  miral, the Earl of Salisbury. He returned to  Holland and between 1725 and 1735 came to  America. Peter M. Groen married Catharina  Louw. and their daughter, Cornelia Marius.  was baptized at Kingston, April 20, 1783. No  record of her children appears at Kingston  I3utch church.   (X'H) Marius, son of Zachariah and Cor-  nelia Marius (Groen) Schoonmaker, was born  April 24. 181 1, in Kingston, where he died  January 5, 1894. He prepared for college at  Kingston Academy and graduated at Yale in  1830. After pursuing a course of law studies  with Ruggles & Hasbrouck in Kingston, he  was admitted to the bar in 1833. .\bout this  time Mr. Ruggles was elected a judge, and  Mr. Schoonmaker became a partner of Has-  brouck in the law practice and this arrange-  ment continued until 1840. when Mr. Has-  brouck became president of Rutgers College  Following this Mr. Schoonmaker continued  the practice of law independently until his  death. Pie was elected a member of the stat°  senate in 1840. and in 1850 was chosen to  represent the then tenth congressional district,  serving in the thirty-second congress. He was  one of the seventeen Whisrs in the state spnate.  who barely controlled that body, and did not  resign his seat to go to congress until the  election of a United States senator had been  settled. Although his district was strongly  Democratic, his personal popularity secured  his election to congress. He declined a re-  election and continued in the practice of his  profession until he was appointed in Jannarv.  iS';©, auditor of the canal department of the  «tate. After one year in this position he wa«  transferred to the hanking department, of  which he was made superintendent, from  which he resigned to again resume the nrac-  tice of law. He was a member of the conven-  tion of 1867 to revise the state constitution,  was active in the public interest and especially  in securing the system of free and graded     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     277     schools which is still in use. For nine years  he served as president of the Kingston board  of education, beginning with its organization.  In 1866-69-70 he was president of the village  of Kingston.

New York, died January i,  1904, in Newburg, New York. He was edu-  cated in the district schools of Shawangunk  and in the Seminary at Armenia, Dutchess  county. New York. In 1852 he opened a gen-  eral store at Tuthilltown in partnership with  his brother, Jacob. The business was but  fairly established, when the elder brother was  drowned at the destruction of the ill-fated  steamer 'Henry Clay' on the Hudson, during  a trip to New York. John Schoonmaker then  sold out the business and removed to New-  burg, where he became a clerk in the general  store of Isaac Wood. In January, 1863. he  formed a partnership with Samuel C. Mills and  .A. Y. Weller and they conducted a dry goods  business at No. 80 Water street, Newburg,  which has continued to the present time and  is now the largest dry goods establishment in  Newburg. Mr. Mills retired July i, 1885, and  the firm became Schoonmaker & WeHer, con-  tinuing thus until June I, 1890. when Mr.  Weller retired. Following this, Mr. Schoon-  maker's son. Samuel V.. was associated with  him in the business and this arrangement con-  tituied until the death of the father. The  latter was a trustee of the Newburg Savings  Bank. Politically he was a Democrat and  joined the Republican party upon its forma-  tion. His first presidential vote was cast for  Franklin Pierce. He was long an elder of the  First Presbyterian Church and was superin-  tendent of Bethel Mission until failing health  compelled him to abandon this position. He  married Mary A. Vail, born April, 1831.  daughter of Simon Raymond Vail. Children :  .'\nna, Elizabeth M., Samuel V., Margaret Le-  Fever. wife of William Clement Scott.     278     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     (VIII) Samuel \'., only son of John and  Mary A. (.Vail) Schoonmaker, was born  March 13, 1867, in Newburg. He attended  the public schools of his native town and  graduated from Philips Exeter Academy, Ex-  eter, New Hampshire, with the class of 1885.  On leaving school he became associated with  his father in business, and in 1888 opened a  branch store on Broadway, Newburg, in as-  sociation with Frank S. Weller. This busi-  ness was closed in i8qi and Mr. Schoonmaker  formed a partnership with A. R. E. Remillard  and Frank S. Weller, conducting a dry .goods  store until 1895. when he disposed of his in-  terest and entered the employ of the firm of  Schoonmaker & W'eller. In '1898 Mr. Weller  retired and S. V. Schoonmaker acquired his  interest and the firm became John Schoon-  maker & Son. After the death of John in 1904  the daughters, Elizabeth M. and Mrs. W. C.  Scott, became interested in the business, Sam-  uel \'. being the only active member. He  married. February i. 1899, Lillian West War-  dell, daughter of Robert L. and Elizabeth  (Henderson) \^'ardell, and they have two  sons, John, born June 10, 1900. and Samuel  V. Jr., born May 23, 1902.     The family name of Schuy-  SCHUYEER ler was originally 'van  Schuyler' when coming to  this country, and by it was meant one resid-  ing in a place of shelter, from the Dutch  'schuiler', a hider; or 'schuil', a shelter; and  possibly also from the German word 'schu-  ler'. a scholar, the intention being to signify  a family of education, or scholarly. The pro-  srenitor of the familv in America commonly  wrote his name 'Philip Pieterse', excepting  when he signed contracts, deeds or other im-  portant documents, when he added 'Schuij-  'er', which could also be expressed bv writing  it 'Schuyler', bv placiner the two small marks  over the letter 'y'. After the year 1667 he  nsuallv wrote his name in full; but after 1672  he had dropped the name 'Pieterse', sienifv-  ine that Peter was his father as one mitrht  now drop the 'Junior' after the death of a  father, and he siened his will 'Philin Schuii-  ler'. In the early familv records he wrote  the names of seven of his children with the  prefix 'van'. Thus one traces the transition,  with its definite reasons, to the present form.  The Schuyler arms : Shield : \''ert. a sin-     ister cubit arm, vested or, cuffed or, holding  on the hand a falcon sable, beaked, membered,  hooded or. Crest : A falcon as in shield.  Motto : 'Semper fidelis' . Arms as blazoned  above were on the stained glass window in  the old Dutch Church and were a few years  ago in the possession of a Miss Schuyler who  showed them to Mr. M. Roosevelt Schuyler.   Two brothers of the name of Van Schuyler,  Philip and David, were among the earliest  settlers of Beversvvyck, who came to this  country from Holland, and it is from them  all of the name in .\merica have proceeded,  which for the first century and a half after  their arrival was distinctively an Albany name.  Unfortunately by the year 1900 it became  extinct in that city, but was still held in high-  est respect in memory. There were many of  them who attained high distinction, especially  in military valor, in governmental affairs, and  as owners of very large estates. Five of the  name were mayors in Albany, and hardly a  more illustrious name appears in .American  history than that of General Philip .Schuyler,  of the revolution.   (I) Colonel Philip Pieterse \'an Schuyler  was the son of Pieter Van Schuyler, of .Am-  sterdain, Holland. He was the better known  of the two brothers who settled in New Neth-  erland, and is recognized as the head of the  family in America, or progenitor of the  Schuyler family. He purchased the property  four miles north of Albany, on the public  highway to Saratoga, which has been the  home of the Schuyler family to this dav. The  original house on this bouwerie was the resi-  dence of Arent Van Curler, a cousin of the  first Patroon. Kiliaen Van Rensselaer, who  came with the colonists to Rensselaerswyck in  1630. He hafi married, in 1643, and on his  return from his bridal journey to Holland  settled on his farm, known as The Flatts. even  as at present it is styled. After him it was  owned by Richard Van Rensselaer, a son of  the Patroon. who relinquished it when he re-  turned to live in Holland. The entry in the  account-book of the Van Rensselaer estate  reads : 'Debit : Philip Van Schuyler, for the  Rouwery called de AHachte (The Flatts) and  the Island, sold to him for 700 beavers and  T.600 florins Holland monev. together 8.000  florins.

Colonel Van Schuyler's son. Colonel  Pieter Schuyler, inherited The Flatts, and he  lived there twelve years, when he leased it to  his son PhiliD, who inherited it in turn, but,  having no children, by his will dated June 28,  1748, he gave the 'Creat Island' to his  brother Jeremy, and to his brother Pieter he  left The Flatts. In the latter's will, drawn  April 27. 1771. he left it to his grandson,  Stephen Schuyler, and in iqio it was occu-  pied by the widow of Richard Schuyler  (Susan Drake), because he was the son of  Stephen R. Schuyler and Catherine Elizabeth  Schuyler, who was the son of Peter S. Schuy-  ler and Catherine Cuyler, who was in turn  the son of Stephen Schuyler and Engeltie Van  Vechten. whose parents were Pieter Schuyler  Jr. and Catherine droesbeck, and his father  was Mayor Pieter Schuyler. In 1910, in the  hallway of The Flatts, hangs the old oil por-  trait of 'Ouidor', the Indian name for Pieter  Schuyler, meaning the 'Indian's Friend', and  in the brick mansion standing on the brow of  the hill, west of the Troy road, hangs the  seven-foot oil portrait of Pieter Schuyler, first  mayor of Albanv, painted in England in 1710,  by order of Queen Anne, and now owned by  the children of John Cuvler Schuyler, uncle  of the late Richard P. Schuyler.   It is interesting to learn a few facts about  this old mansion, as described by Mrs. Grant  more than a century ago in her famous 'Me-  moirs of an American Lady', wherein she  writes :   'It was a large brick house of two, or  rather three stories ffor there were excellent  attics), besides a sunk storv. finished with ex-     actest neatness. The lower floor had two spa-  cious rooms, with large, light closets; on the  first there were three rooms, and in the upper  one four. Through the middle of the house  was a wide passage, with opposite front and  back doors, which in summer admitted a  stream of air peculiarly grateful to the languid  senses. It was furnished with chairs and  pictures like a summer parlor. Here the fam-  ily usually sat in hot weather, when there  were no ceremonious strangers. One room,  I should have said, in the greater house only,  was opened for the reception of company ; all  the rest were bedchambers for their accom-  modation, while the domestic friends of the  family occupied neat little bedrooms in the  attics or the winter-house. This house con-  tained no drawing-room — that was an un-  heard-of luxury; the winter-rooms had car-  pets ; the lobby had oilcloth painted in loz-  enges, to imitate blue and white marble. The  best bedroom was hung with family portraits,  some of which were admirably executed ; and  in the eating-room, which, by the by, was  rarely used for that purpose, were some Scrip-  tural paintings.   'The house fronted the river, on the brink  of which, under shades of elm and sycamore,  ran the great road toward Saraotga, Still-  water, and the northern lakes ;' a little simple  avenue of morella cherry trees, enclosed with  a white rail, led to the road and river, not  three hundred yards distant'.   The place may be reached by taking a drive  four miles to the north of Albany, or about  one mile beyond the Rural cemetery, then  turning abruptly to the east, crossing the canal  by the 'Schuyler's Bridge', and continuing a  fourth of a mile towards the Hudson. The  road passes between rows of elms evidently a  century old, and the low, brick house stands  to the right, facing the river, while across the  road is the old family burial-ground, contain-  insf some sixty graves, whose rows of invari-  able brown sandstone, some tottering to the  right or left, look wierdly like a decrepit army,  for thus have they stood during two centuries,  bearing testimony in verse to the exalted mem-  ory of many a soldier Schuyler. This head of  the Schuvler line was a man much esteemed  bv his acquaintances and by representatives of  the Dutch government. He was the first man  in the colony to receive the commission of  captain. He died at The Flatts. May Q. 1683,     28o     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     and was buried in the old Dutch church which  then stood at the intersection of Broadway  and State street, Albany.

(TT) Arent, son of Colonel Philip Pieterse  and Margarita (Van .Slechtenhorst) .'^chuvler,  was born at Rensselaerswvck (Albany, New-  York) Tune 25, 1662, died November 26, 17.30:     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     iSi     The codicil of his will was dated October 30,  1730. In July, 1684, shortly after attaining  his majority, and having fitted himself for the  life of a merchant or trader, also possessing  a sutificient sum of money to embark, he began  preparations for marriage and housekeeping  by buying a house on Pearl street, 'where the  eagle hangs out', from his mother, paying her  two hundred beavers in two installments. In-  stead of a door plate, in order to represent  his name by its significance, he hung outside  a live eagle in a cage. He selected for his  wife, Jenneke Teller, daughter of William  Teller, who had come to Fort Orange in 1639,  and Margaret (Donchesen) Teller, and he  married her in Rensselaerswyck, November  26, 1684, two years before the city received its  charter as Albany. A few months after their  marriage they appeared before a notary to  make a joint will. It was filed in Albany and  written in Dutch, and read in part as follows :  'The worthy Mr. Arent Schuyler and Jenneke  Teller, lawfully wedded husband and wife,  living here in Albany, both sound in body and  in mind, able to walk and stand, memory and  s])eecli unimpaired, who together having met  and moved by their mutual affection and love,  and together having meditated on the certainty  of death, and the uncertainty of the hour of  it, have directed without being persuaded or  influenced by anybody, to have their last will  and testament drawn up''. His wife died in  the year 1700, and he married (second) at  Albany, January 2, 1703. Swantje Van Duyck-  huysen. It is recorded in one family nar-  rative, 'Taylors' Annals', that he married a  third wife, Maria ^^'alte^, in 1724, who was  living in Belleville, New Jersey, in 1734. Chil-  dren : I.

Arent Schuyler continued to attend his  t'lrivine business for some time, something  like five vears of his married life, and then     was called more and more into public service.  He served on a committee for providing fuel  and other comforts for the houses occupied  by Indians when on their trading expeditions  to Albany. He was also on the committee to  raise funds for fortifications and he partici-  pated energetically in the proceedings of the  Albany convention in opposition to the pre-  tensions of Jacob Leisler. After the Indians  and French had accomplished the destruction  of Schenectady in 1690, he joined the party of  Captain Abraham Schuyler, who were direct-  ed to proceed to Otter Creek and remain four  weeks to watch the lakes and surrounding  country in case of attack. He volunteered to  lead a scouting party into Canada at this time,  and although it consisted of eight Indians, and  himself, the only white man, he was undaunt-  ed. They went through the wooded wilder-  ness and through the lake, down the Sorel  river to Fort Chambly, and under its walls  killed two and took one Frenchman prisoner.  By this exploit he was the first man of the  English or Dutch to lead a hostile party from  this province into Canada. He was thereafter  widely known as a courageous man, and was  commissioned captain. In August, 1692, the  acting governor. Ingoldesby, was apprised of  the fact that a delegation of southern Indians,  who had been at war with the Five Nations,  was on the way to visit their enemies and to  sue for peace. They had arrived at the Dela-  ware river, and were waiting for permission  to continue their journey. The governor and  his council considered this an important busi-  ness, requiring unusual wisdom in its man-  agement. They concluded that Captain Arent  Schuyler, then in New York, was exactly  suited to the delicacy of the undertaking, and  decided to despatch him to meet the Indians,  that he might conduct them to the governor  and council. He was furnished with the  proper instructions and given wampum belts  to use. Considering the mode of travelling  in those days, he was decidedly expeditious,  for only six days afterwards he returned with  the 'far Indians, called Shawanoes, and some  Senecas, who had been travelling together for  nine years'. His expense account is of pe-  culiar interest, and sets forth that on August  7 ?th it was necessary to pav for ferriage at 1  Elizabethtown : on the T4th. lodging and horse  'lire; on the 15th for horse hire to (Trenton')  Falls and a guide to the Indians; on the i6th.     282     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     for two Holland shirts to be given to Indian  chiefs ; expenses at Raritan and Woodbridge ;  on the 17th, horse hire from Benjamin  Ckiet's to Ehzabethtown ; on the 18th, expense  at the same place and ferriage from Davitt's ;  at New York, charges for butcher's meat  crackers and peas, furnished for the Indians,  and on arrival, for the comfort and keeping  of the Indians, 'fourteen gallons single beer,  fish, bread, and oysters', the expenses for the  entire trip, for all, amounting to but little  more than twelve English pounds. He pre-  sented a belt at the end of each proposition,  addressing them as 'brethren' and they him  as 'Corlaer'. On account of so many and  frequent demands made upon him to treat  with the Indians or engage in campaigns, Ar-  ent Schuyler's business had been seriously  neglected. His brother Brandt and his sister  Gertrude (Geertruj) were both married and  had settled in New York. Albany was then a  frontier town and exposed to attack, so con-  sidering everything he departed for New  York about February, 1694, determined to re-  sume business as a merchant. It was deter-  mined at a council held Feliruary 3. 1694, by  Gnvcrnor Fletcher, that as there were one  hundred Frenchmen and fifty French Indians  comin? into the Minisink country to debauch  the Minisink Indians, that a trustworthy mes-  sengfcr must be despatched to seek out their  intent. Arent Schuyler was again selected.  He started the afternoon of the day he was  told of the mission, and the day after reached  the Indian village, eight miles beyond Hack-  cnsack. His conference was favorable, and  after an absence of six days among dangerous  tribes, he returned to New York. On June  ^. if^)?. Arent Schuyler and Anthony Brock-  hoist purchased of the Indians four thousand  acres of land at Pequannock. On November  TT, 1695, thev purchased the title of the East  Tcrsev nroprietors to the same tract for one  hundred pounds. On May 20, 1697. ^^ re-  ceived from Governor Fletcher a patent for  land in the Minisink country, called bv the  Indians Sankhekeneck. alias Masrhawaem ;  also a parcel of meadow called Wainsagsk-  meck. on the Minisink river, containing one  thousand acres.   He removed from New York to Pompton  Plains, New Tersey. about 1702. where he  remained until 1710. when he removed to a  large farm which he had purchased from Ed-     mund Kingsland, on New Barbadoes Neck,  on the east side of the Passaic river, the deed  dated April 20, 1710; the amount three hun-  dred and thirty pounds. A negro slave be-  longing to him accidentally found a copper  deposit while he was plowing. He had turned  over a peculiarly greenish and very heavy sort  of stone. He took it to his master and it  was sent to England to be analyzed. The  reply was . that it contained eighty per cent  copper, and this opened a means for Arent  Schuyler to obtain wealth. Desiring to re-  ward the slave he told him that he might make  three requests, to which the fellow replied ;  first, that he might remain with his master as  long as he lived ; second, that he might have  all the tobacco he could smoke; and third, that  lie might be gi\en a dressing gown with big  brass buttons, like his master's. Schuyler told  him to consider and ask for something less  trifling, and the answer was that for the fourth  request he might have a little more tobacco.  Before his death he had shipped to the Bristol  copper and brass works, England, one thou-  sand three hundred and eighty-six tons. In  T761. on receipt of an engine from England,  the mine was extensively operated for four  years. Three miles above the present city of  Newark and opposite the old town of Belle-  ville, on the Passaic river, Arent Schuyler  erected his mansion. It was built by him in  1 710. and is standin?. in excellent condition, at  the present time. It is believed that he had  to send to Holland for the brick that com-  posed the front, and the other walls of tlie  brownstone were found at Belleville. It has  been the residence of generations of the  Schuyler familv since that time, and its simple,  substantial architecture is a noble type. In  the olden days there was a magnificent deer  park about the house, stocked with no less  than one hundred and fifty animals of that  kind. Arent Schuyler was most liberal.   He was an officer of the Reformed Dutch  church, and soon after he settled on the Pas-  saic he assisted in organizing it at Belleville.  He gave it one hundred and fiftv pounds in  1729, as a commencement of a fund for the  pastor's salarv. and shortlv after added three  himdred pounds. .After his death in i/'^o his  widow and five children, in respect to his  memory, contributed fifty pounds apiece, and  in 1739 Tohn added one hundred and fifty  pounds, arranging for the right to vote on     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     283     calling a minister as also the privilege of sign-  ing the call, and the consistory bound itself  and successors not to invite a clergyman of  another denomination to occupy the pulpit  without his or their consent, provided always  that they were members of the Dutch church.  Colonel Schuyler, however, withdrew from  the church because of a difference, and while  leaving the fund he united with the Episco-  palians and built a church for them in the  same place.   (Ill) Casparus, son of Arent and Jenneke  (Teller) Schuyler, was baptized in New York  City, May 5, 1695, died April 13, 1754. He  received from his father a deed for land in  Burlington, New Jersey, at Lossa or Wing-  worth's Point, and he owned considerable  property along the Delaware river. The line  of the Schuyler family that sprang from him  became very much distinguished for the suc-  cession of high church dignitaries and other  figures in the learned world that belonged to  it, just as other lines in the same family  gained considerable military distinction.  Among his descendants who entered the  church may be mentioned the Rev. Livingston  Schuyler, Rev. Hamliton Schuyler, Rev. Cam-  eron Mann. Casparus Schuyler married in  Burlington, in 1723, Mary Schuyler, a distant  cousin.   (IV) Arent (2), only son of Casparus and  Mary (Schuyler) Schuyler, was born about  1720. He married. May 19, 1748, Jannetie  Van Wagenen.   CV) Arent (3). son of Arent (2) and Jan-  netie (\'an Wagenen) Schuyler, was born in  1754. He married Hester Dey in 1784. Chil-  dren: I.

(VI) .\nthony Dey, son of Arent (3) and  Hester (Dey) Schuyler, was born October 18,  178';. He married Sarah Ridge. October 25.  1810.   fVII) The Rev. Dr. Montgomery Schuvler,  son of Anthony Dey and Sarah (Ridge)  Schuyler, was born at New York City, Janu-  arv 0, 1814, died at St. Louis, Missouri, in  t8o<5. He entered Geneva (now Hobart) Col-  lege in 1830, leaving at the end of his junior  year, and was graduated at Union in 1834.     After some years spent in the practice of law  he entered the Protestant Episcopal ministry.  He was dean of Christ Church Cathedral in  St. Louis for more than forty years and made  many valuable contributions to ecclesiastical  literature. He married (first) Sarah Sand-  ford; (second) October 10, 1843, Lydia Eliza  Roosevelt, daughter of Nicholas I. Roosevelt ;  ( third ) Sophia Elizabeth Norton. Children :   1 . Montgomery Roosevelt, mentioned below.   2. Rev. Louis Sandford, who died a martyr to  yellow fever while ministering to the sufferers  from the epidemic at Memphis, Tennessee, in  1878.   (\TII) Montgomery Roosevelt, son of Rev.  Dr. Montgomery and Lydia E. (Roosevelt)  Schuyler, was born at Skaneateles, Onondaga  county. New York, February 18, 1848. He  was educated at the United States Naval  Academy. Mr. Schuyler is a prominent mer-  chant and clubman of New York. He belongs  to the Century, Manhattan, Brook, Larchmont  Yacht, New York Yacht, Fencing, and Auto-  mobile clubs and to the Holland Society. His  out-of-town home is at Orangeburg, New  York.     John Brooks, the founder of  BROOKS the family in this country, emi-  grated from England in 1730  in the ship 'George and Annie', landed at  Cape Cod, and later settled in Orange countv,  New York, where he died.

The Mount family is supposed  MOUNT to be of French origin, the orig-  inal patronymic, Le Mont, be-  coming anglicised after some of the family  settled in England at the time of or following  the invasion of that country by William the  Conqueror. In England the family and its  branches are found chieHy in the counties of  .Surrey and Buckinghamshire. In revolution-  ary times in America the Mounts, with two  or three exceptions, were ardent patriots, at  least' twenty members of the family having  served in the Continental army, and of these  some gave up their lives for the cause. The  family was strongly identified with the early  history of the old church of Tennent, New  Jersey, the names of many of its members  being found in the baptism, burial, and com-  municant lists of the church. They are con-  spicuous too in the lists of contributors to the  building and upkeep of the edifice. In the  neighboring Fir,st Presbyterian Church of  Cranbury three generations of the family were  elders. Some of the original Mount family  stock now reside in England in the counties of  Monmouth. Middlesex, and the southern parts  of the country. Of those who came to Amer-  ica some settled at an early date in Mrginia,  Oliio. Kentucky and Indiana, and there are  also prominent families of the name in Louis-  iana, Mississippi. Missouri, y\rkansas. and on  the Pacific coast, most of whom owe their  origin to early ancestors in New Jersey.   Many members of this family have married  into the leading families, past and present, in  the counties of Mercer, Middlesex and Mon-  mouth in New Jersey. The family ramifica-  tions have extended very widely, tiiough it is  not of course claimed that everybody bearing  the name in America owe their origin to the  same immigrant ancestor, or even have any  relation at all. It is certain that many bearing  the name of Mont or Le Mont, or some other  name akin to these forms, have in course of  time had their name metamorphosed to the  more prevalent and obvious form of Mount.  The first of the family or of the name to     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     settle in New Jersey was George Mount, who  died in 1705. He was one of the original  purchasers of Middletown, Monmouth coun-  ty, New Jersey, from the Indians in 1665.  George Mount bought land jointly with Ben-  jamin Borden, who came from Rhode Island,  so it is probable that he also came from the  same locality. George Mount was one of the  founders of the First Baptist Church of Mid-  dletown, Monmouth county. New Jersey, in  1667. He was also deputy to the general  assembly, held at Portland Point in 1668. He  married a lady of the name of Katherine, but  whose other name remains unrecorded. They  had at least three children, Matthias, Richard  and Katherine. Matthias, who lived at Mid-  dletown, Monmouth county. New Jersey, died  in 1695, having married Mary, and had chil-  dren Matthias and Thomas. Richard also  lived at Middletown, like his brother, Mat-  thias, and also owned land on Cranbury creek,  Middlesex county. New Jersey. He died in  1715, having married Rebecca and had chil-  dren : Richard and George. Probably John  was also his son ; the will of this John Mount  is dated 1772, and in it he mentions his chil-  dren. John, Catherine, Phebe. Alice ; his  grandchildren, Chloe. the daughter of John  and liis grandchild : and Joseph, son of Mat-  thias, deceased. Thomas Mount, who lived  at Shrewsbury, was the son of Matthias, the  son of George, and had four children. The  eldest of them was Samuel, who moved to  New York and became the ancestor of the  Mounts of that city. He married Margaret,  daughter of Adam Dobbs. and had five chil-  dren : Adam. Joseph, Frances, Thomas and  ^^'ilIiam. It is very probable that the Mount  familv here dealt with is descended from  Samuel through one of the sons mentioned  above.   fl) Edward Mount is the first member of  the family here under consideration directly  in line. So far all attempts to discover the  links binding him to the first George have  failed though it is almost undoubted that he  was one of his descendants. He lived in  New York Citv and was a master mason. He  married Mary Polheumus, whose brother,  A -iron Polheumus, was a prominent silk man-  ufacturer of Paterson, New Jersey. Children :  I. Elizabeth, married (first) a Mr. Price, and  ('second') a Mr. Hammon. 2. Edward, men-  tioned below.     (II) Edward (2), son of Edward (i) and  Mary (Polheumus) Mount, was born in New  York City in 1839, died in 1877. He was  educated in New York City, and was a master  mechanic for the New York, New Haven &  Hartford railroad. He had a good deal of  ability and a promising career, but he died  before he reached the age of forty. He was  a member of the East River Yacht Club, and  a member of the Copeston Lodge, Free and  Accepted Masons, New York City. He mar-  ried Fredericka Merritt, who died in 1869.  •^be was the daughter of Frederick S. and  Elizabeth (Kranz) Merritt. of New York City.  They had one son, James Carr, mentioned  below   (III) James Carr, only son of Edward (2)  and Fredericka (Merritt) Mount, was born in  New York City, December 25, 1863. He was  educated in the public schools of New York  and Philadelphia. When he grew up he went  into the auditing department of the Wells,  Fargo Express Company, and remained there  for a year or two. In 1880 he settled with  his uncle at Highland Falls. New York. On  the organization of the Citizens' National  Bank of Highland Falls he was made cashier,  a position he still retains. He is a Free  Mason, and a member of the Knights of  Pythias. He served in the Snanish-American  war in the Fourth United States Volunteer  Infantrv Immunes.     Kreutz is a German surname.  KREUTZ and is probably derived from   Kreuz. the German word for  Cross. The name is well known in Ger-  many, and is also used in connection  with other words to form comnounded sur-  names. The name occurs occasionallv in the  records of the old emigration from Germany,  verv often being slightlv changed in an effort  to preserve the pronunciation at the cost of  the orthographv. just as the German 'Rraun'  often becomes 'Brown' in this coimtrv.   fl) Benedict Kreutz was horn in Trier, the  Rhine Province. Germany, died in Germany  in 1909. He was a tanner by occupation. He  served in the Prussian army during the years  18J.8 and 1849. He married Lena Simon,  there beins eight children of the marriage.  Four of these children only grew up to adult  life. They were Tohn. mentioned below;  Christina, Louisa, Theresa.     286     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     (II) John, son of Benedict and Lena  (Simon) Kreutz, was born in the village of  Schoenecken, Province of the Rhine, Ger-  many, January 22, 1854. His education was  obtained in Germany, and in 1870, at the age  of sixteen, he came to this country, settling  in course of time in Newburg, New York.  From Newburg he went to Highland Falls,  where he now lives, leading a retired life.  He learned the baker trade in Germany, and  when he settled in Highland Falls he engaged  in that business, starting in a small way. He  gradually increased his business, and at his  retirement in the year 1908 he had the largest  business in that section of the county. He  was one of the incorporators of the First  National Bank of Highland Falls, and is now  second vice-president in the same institution.  Mr. Kreutz is a Mason, belonging to West  Point Lodge, No. 877, Free and Accepted  Masons, and a charter member of the same  lodge. He is also a member of the Indepen-  dent Order of Odd Fellows, and of the  Knights of Pythias. He married, in 1879,  Sophia Gerken, born in 185 1, in New York,  daughter of Julius and Johanna (Rolfs) Ger-  ken, of German descent. There have been  eight children of the marriage, four of whom  are now living, namely : Mary, who is at  home with her father ; Theresa, who is a  teacher in the high school at Yonkers; John,  mentioned below ; Eleanor, who is at school  at the present time in New Haven, Connecti-  cut ; Arthur. Sophia. Benedict, .'\flelaide. all  of whom died when young.   fill) John (2). only son of John (i) and  Sophia (Gerken') Kreutz. was born at High-  land Falls. New York, October 9, 1883. He  is now in business in Eaton, Colorado.     This surname, as far as con-  FORSYTH cerns its place of origin, is  prevalent chiefly in Scotland.  The name is in all likelihood derived after  the Norman fashion from Forcett (whence  aNn Fawcctt), a township in the wanentakc  of Gillingwest in the North Riding of York-  shire. England. Most genuine Scottish names  are patronymical in origin, that is they are  derived from the surname of some near or  remote ancestor with mac, after the Gaelic  fashion, or some other prefix or suffix at-  tached. Whether the family in its earliest  days originated in Yorkshire, or in some other     county in the north of England or in Scot-  land, it is certain that it is chiefly with Scot-  land that the family and the family name are  associated. There are five families of the  name, nearly all situated with their subsidiary  branches north of the Tweed, who are the  possessors of legalized coats-of-arms. The  chief of these shields heraldically described is :  Argent a cheval, engraved between three grif-  fins segreant vert, armed and ducally crowned  or. Crest : A denii griffin vert, armed and  ducally crowned or.   (I) John Forsyth, the immigrant ancestor  in America of the Forsyth family here dealt  with, was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1786  or 1787, and died at Newburg, Orange county.  New York, in 1854. He was educated in the  public schools of Aberdeen and had for a  schoolmate Lord Byron. He came to this  country in 1805, intending to go to Georgia,  but some of his father's family had settled in  this state years before and he stayed in New  York City for a time. Finally by the advice  of Professor Kemp of Columbia College he  settled in Newburg, Orange county, and found  employment there. He began to live in New-  burg in the year t8io. and he continued in  his first position until 1825. in which year he  became engaged in the building business, join-  ing as a partner in the firm of Law. Beveridge  & Company. His association with this firm  and business continued until the time of his  death in 1854. He had. however, various  other interests and was director of the Na-  tional Bank of Newburg, trustee of the New-  burg Academy, and was prominently connect-  ed with the Newburg Steam Mills. He was  for a long time an elder in the Associate  Reformed Church and was a generous and  zealous member.

This family was one of the first  SAHTH to settle in Orange county. New  York, locating there as early as  1727. Smith Cove, near the village of High-  land Falls, was named for the family, and  mention is made of that settlement in the  records of Cornwall in 1765.   (11 Clark Smith, the progenitor of this  branch of the family, was for many years a  prosperous farmer in the county. He made  his home near Mineral Springs, then in the  town of Monroe, which in 1889 became the  town of Woodbury.

Smith is what is sometimes called  SMITH an occupational surname, and as   such it is used in its various  modifications in many countries. The word  Smith is Anglo-Saxon in origin and comes  from smitan, to smite, originally 'any one who  strikes or smites with a hammer, an artificer,  a carpenter, smith or workman.'' In later times  Smith was applied specifically to a worker in  metals, while wyrhta. wright, was given to  artificers in wood and other materials. Be-  sides Smith simple, we have Smithson (the  proper names of the Earls of Northumber-  land, but rejected by them in favor of Percy),  to which the Irish and Scotch Mac Gowan     ( meaning son of the Smith, but generally  anglicised simply Smith) corresponds, as well  as the Smithsons and Grosmiths, who, if they  have not corrupted the spelling, are set off  against the Fabrucci or 'little Smiths' of  Italian celebrity. So general was the appli-  cation of the word 'smith' that in the Saxon  Chronicle we find the expression 'mighty war-  smiths' applied to valorous soldiers, and the  great enemy of mankind is called 'hell smith,'  thou.gh the phrase, being also applied to Vul-  can, has probably a direct reference to smith-  ery in the modern sense. Blacksmith and  Whitesmith are also used as surnames, but  they are rare. The Brownsmith was one who-  prepared the far-famed 'brown bills' once  more formidable than the 'Brown Bess' of  later times. Nasmyth stands for nail-smith or  nailer. The Arrowsmiths of old prepared the  arrows, as the Spearsmiths fashioned the  spears and lances. The Shoesmiths took care  of the horses' feet. The Billsmiths made bills,  the Shearsmiths shears and the Knyfesmiths  knives. The Locksmiths made locks and keys  in the olden days as they do today. Gold-  smiths are known in every country, and the  brass and copper workers of ancient days are  now represented in the familv nomenclature  by Arsmiths and Copperwrights. 'Bokell-  smyths' are mentioned in a quaint English  poem called 'Cock Lorelles Bote' in conjunc-  tion with 'blacksmyths and ferrars'' and henc;  doubtless the otherwise unintelligible name of  Bucksniilh. who is thus proved to be next of  kin to the Bucklers. Again the obsolete  Hvldsmith is a soldier, being a compound of  the Ancrlo-Saxon hild, war, battle. One Will-  iam Hvldsmith dwelt in Cambridgeshire,  temp., Edward I. More than two hundred  years ago Verstegan asked the question :   'From whence comes Smith all be he knight or  squire.  But frnm the smith that forgeth at the fire?'   '\'el it would appear from the addition or  the alteration of a letter that some families are  unwilling to be content with such a genealogy  for their surname. There is little doubt, how-  ever, that all the Smiths, Smitheses, Smithes,  Smythes, Smijths, etc., were originally pos-  sessors of the same occupational surname. In  France the same fastidiousness prevails on the  subject and Monsieur Lefevrc (a word now  supplanted by Forgeron) often writes himself     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     291     Lefebvre. British statistics show that in the  years 1838-54 the Smiths registered for births,  marriages and deaths a number amounting to  286, 307, or about one in seventy of the total  number of persons that were registered.   (I) Thomas Smith was born September 16,  1823, in Nova Scotia, died August 24, 1905,  aged eighty-two years. He spent part of his  youth in Nova Scotia, where he was educated.  But the larger scope offered to a career of  talent in the United States attracted him, and  he finally went to Rockland county, New York.  His business was the manufacturing of shoes,  and he built up a concern of considerable pro-  portions. In politics Mr. Smith was a Repitb-  lican. and he was affiliated with the Methodist  church. He married Hanna Penoyer (Rob-  bins) Dutcher, widow of Abraham Dutcher,  and daughter of Nathaniel and Elizabeth  Robbins. The children of Abraham and Han-  na P. (Robbins) Dutcher were: Oliver H. :  Lavina, widow of Peter Anthony, of Closter,  New Jersey. Children of Thomas and Hanna  P. (Robbins-Dutcher) Smith were : Charlotte;  Henry Edwin, mentioned below ; Evelina ;  Washington Irving; Mary Elizabeth.   (II) Henry Edwin, eldest son of Thomas  and Hanna Penoyer (Robbins-Dutcher)  Smith, was born at Clarkstown, Rockland  county. New York, March 26, 1846. He was  educated in the public schools, and started in  his business career by engaging in the express,  transportation and undertaking business. After  he had spent some years in these lines of busi-  ness he was appointed keeper in Sing Sing  prison, when he was about twenty years old  and served in that capacity for about four  years. Some time after he left that position  he was appointed clerk of the capitol commis-  sion at Albany and served in that position for  four years, the period of his engagement be-  ing from 1872 to 1876. He then looked out  for a complete change of environment and  secured a farm in Ember, Wyoming, where  he spent two years in ranching, ^^'hen he left  Wyoming he returned to Nyack. In IQ08 he  was elected village clerk of the Nyack munic-  ipalitv and still holds that position, Mr.  Smith has also seen military service. He en-  listed December 30, 1863, in Company B, One  Hundred and Twenty-seventh New York Vol-  unteers. He served one year and was then  transferred to Camp A, Fifty-fourth Veteran  \'olunteers of New Jersey. He served under     General Sherman in his 'march to the sea,' the  capture of Charleston and until the close of  the war. After the closing of hostilities he was  appomted captain of Company B, Sixteenth  Battalion of the National Guard of the State  of New York. Mr. Smith is past mas-  ter of Rockland Lodge, No. 723, Free and  Accepted Masons; past commander of Wal-  dron Post, No. 82, Grand Army of tiie Re-  public, and secretary of the Star Publishing  Company of Nyack. Mr. Smith is a Repub-  lican in politics. He was elected supervisor  and town collector for three terms in the town  of Orangetown, also appointed clerk of the  board of water commission and clerk of the  board of sewer commission, serving full terms.  He and his family belong to the Methodist  church.   Pie married. May 8, 1841, at Clarkstown,  Rockland county. New York, Theresa Louisa,  daughter of George F. and Emeline (Strong)  Burdick. Mr. Burdick, the father of Mrs.  Theresa Louisa (Burdick) Smith, was a man-  ufacturer of shoes. His other children were:  Frank W., Anna M., Daniel Strong, Lawton  M., George, Frances, Minnie.     Many of the large and important  ESSEX industries of the Hudson valley  and of New York state have  been founded and carried to successful oper-  ation by men of English birth and mechanical  training. As a nation the English are thor-  ough in their methods and in the mechanical  arts have long led the v^'orld. The name of  Essex in the United States is intimately con-  nected with the early manufacture of needles ;  the founder of this branch of the family being  also the founder of that great industry.   (I) Henry Essex was born in England,  where he was educated and learned the trade  of machinist ; he also became a skilled worker  in metal ; after coming to the United States  he worked in various places, finally settling  not far from New York City, where he en-  gaged in manufacturing. He became inter-  ested in the manufacture of sewing needles  and was the first in the United States to manu-  facture that useful household necessity. T-ater  in life he became proprietor of the 'Delinore  House' at Piermont, New York, which he  operated from 1886 until 1889, when he re-  tired. He was a Republican in politics, and a     292     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     member of the Protestant Episcopal church.  He married Harriet Lane.

No biographical work on  STUYVESANT the historic families of  America is comjjlete  without a full account of this famous family,  whose progenitor was Petrus Stuyvesant, the  last governor of New Netherlands under the  Dutch regime. The family was of ancient  origin in Holland. The name is derived from  the word, 'stuiven,' to stir or raise dust, and  the word 'sand.'' Rev. Balthazar Stuyvesant,  or Stuyfsant, as the name was sometimes  spelled, was a well educated and scholarly  man. He was for some years pastor of the  Reformed church at Berkilum, in the province  of Friesland, Holland. He later removed to  Guelderland, where he died in 1637. The  heraldic description of the family seal is as  follows: Arms, per fesse or and gules; in  chief, a hound following a hare ; in base, a  stag, courant : all ])roper and Courturne.  Crest: r)ut of a j)rince's coronet, or a demi-  stag salient and conturne proper. Motto :  Jovoe Proestat federi quam homini.   (I) Petrus. son of Rev. Balthazar Stuyve-  sant, was born in Holland, in 1592. The exact  place of his birth is not definitely known. He  received a liberal education and at an early  date entered the army. He was appointed by  the West India Company governor of the  island of Curacao, in the Caribbean sea. His  administration of the affairs of the compa'iv  in the island gained him great distinction. lie  also aclrieved military honors through his  heroic work in an expedition against the islcmn  of .St. Martin, a Portuguese possession, in  1644. In the attack on the island he was  severely wounded in his right leg. In order  to receive proper medical treatment, he wa«  forced to return to Holland, where it was  found necessary to amputate the limb. ,i.pd for  the remainder of ids life he was forced to  wear a wooden leg. The loss of his leg did  not lessen his desire for military exploits, and  on July 28. 1646. he was cnnimission'^H  director-eeneral. or governor of New Nether-  lands. He arrived in New Amsterdam. ?^I^.y  27. 1647. where he received a public ov?tion.  He at once took up the administration of the  affairs of the province with ereat visror. His  Jurisdiction extended over the territory em-  braced bv the present state of New York, and  the coimtry south to the month of the Dela-  ware river. He had charge of the administra-  tion of the affairs in the islands of Asuba.     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     293     Bonaire and Curacao on the Spanish Main.  He gave the colony of New Amsterdam pro-  tection from attacks of hostile Indians and  the aggression of European countries. He had  a strong paHsade built across the island north  of the town, following practically the present  location of Wall and Rector streets. He sent  out expeditions against the Swedes, who were  settling on the Delaware river, and the Indians  at Esopus. His administration of the affairs  of New Amsterdam was distinguished for  firmness and ability, and while it would be  considered to-day as despotic, yet in all his  personal relations he was honest, considerate  and never cruel. All his actions were gov-  erned by a high-minded sense of the dignity  of his office. When the inhabitants com-  plained of the high rate of taxes and insisted  in having a voice in the management of the  colony, he at first refused their demands, but  finally permitted a council of nine men to be  elected by burghers to consult with him in the  management. He had rigid ideas as to the  freedom of public worship and would not  permit the clergy to depart from the orthodox  ideas of the Dutch church. In one instance  he fined a preacher five hundred dollars for  expounding doctrines differing from the reg-  ularly accepted theology of the Dutch Re-  formed church. Fie made many improvements  in the city. He recognized the possibilities of  New Amsterdam as a center of trade for the  growing colonies of America and prophesied  the time would come when its 'ships would  ride on every sea.' England too recognized  the importance of the colony, and in 1664,  when the English fleet appeared in the harbor  and demanded the surrender of the city. Gov-  ernor Stuyvesant flew in a rage and declared  'as long as he had a leg to stand on or an  arm to fight with,' he would never surrender.  He did everything in his power to withstand  a seige, but his efforts were without avail as  his force of two hundred militia and sixty  resrulars could not successfully oppose a force  of four men-of-war, mounting ninetv-two guns  and manned by a force of four hundred and  fifty men. On Sentember 8, 1664, he sur-  rendered the city. In 1665 he was recalled to  Holland by the government to give a report  on his administration. In 166*^ he returned  to New York, where he made his home until  his death in early 1672.   He owned valuable real estate in the city.     His residence was known as 'White-hall,' the  present \\'hitehall street being named after it.  Governor Stuyvesant's house, the Bouwerie,  with grounds of some eighty acres, was situ-  ated in that part of the present city of New  York, comprised between Third avenue, the  East river. Sixth and 23rd streets. The house  on this place cost 6.500 guilders, a large sum  for those days. It was east of Third avenue,  on lots now covered by the Trow Directory  Building, at 12th street, and remained stand-  ing until 1777, when it was destroyed by fire.  Many New Yorkers of the present time can  recall the historic pear tree enclosed within an  iron railing, which stood on Third avenue and  13th street, and which was planted there on  Governor Stuyvesant's return from Europe.  This tree survived until 1867. After the  burning of the Stuyvesant residence, it was  rebuilt on the same site by the grandfather of  Mr. A. Van H. Stuyvesant. The remains of  Governor Stuyvesant lie in the vault originally  constructed by himself, beneath the chapel on  his estate in the latter part of the eighteenth  century. This chapel having fallen into decay,  Petrus Stuyvesant ( IV) . a great-grandson of  the Governor, induced the vestry of Trinity  Church to erect a new edifice on the same  site : it was known as St. Mark's Church in  the Bowery, and was dedicated April 25, 170.=;.  This was on the site of the present St. Mark's  Church, at Second avenue. Tenth and Elev-  enth streets. He was an active and devout  member of the Dutch church.   Governor .Stuyvesant was married in Am-  sterdam, Holland, to Judith Bayard, descend-  ent of a Hueuenot family of France. She  died in New York in 1687. She was a devout  member of the Dutch church, and was a  woman of great talent. She spoke several lan-  guas'es fluently and was a fine musician. Two  children were born to them: i. Balthazar,  born in 1647. died on the island of Nevis in  1675 ; he was married at .Saint Eustace in the  West Indies ; two children : Judith and Kath-  erine. 2.

Children : Solomon ; Ben-  jamin, referred to below ; Bertha.   (Ill) Benjamin, son of Aaron and Caro-  line (Goldsmith) Levison, was born in New  Rochelle, Westchester county. New York,  July 19, 1872, and is now living in Nyack,  Rockland county. New York. He received  his education in the public schools of New  Rochelle and Nyack, and then determining to  study law, he became a clerk in the law office  of -A. A. Demarcst in Nyack, and was admit-  ted to the New York bar as attorney, Septem-  ber 14, 1893, at the general term of the su-  preme court in Brooklyn. Since then he has  been engaged in a lucrative general practice in  Nyack. He is a Democrat in politics; he was  elected justice of the peace of the town of  Orange, January i, 1904, and served until  January I, 1910; he was elected police magi-  strate of the village of Nyack, January i,  1906, to serve until December 31, 191 1, and  was elected to succeed himself, January i,  1912. He is a member of Mount Moriah  Lodge, No. 27, Free and Accepted Masons,  of New York City, of Consistory No. 32, of  New York City, of Mecca Temple, of New  York City, and of the Rockland Coun-  tv Bar Association. He is a member of the  Nyack Hebrew Congregation. He is unmar-  ried.     This ranks among the most prev-  SCOTT alent of surnames in the British  _ Isles, almost sixty coats-of-arms  being assigned to it, while the London Direc-  tory shows about two hundred traders in the  metrojiolis so denominated. In records of  early date it is usually written Le Scot, im-  plying a native of Scotland. Now as the  tendency of Scotchmen to 'go south' is prov-  erbial in Britain, the commonness of the name  in England is not to be wondered at ; but why  many families that never lived out of Scot-  land' should be called Scott, is not so readily  explained. The Duke of Buccleuch, the head  of the surname in Scotland, traces his pedi-     296     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     gree to Richard Le Scot, of Murdeston, county  Lanark, one of the Scottish barons, who swore  feahy to Edward I., in 1296. The name exists  in records of earher date, but the claim set up  by one zealous genealogist for a Norman ex-  traction has no foundation. M. de Gerville  remarks : 'It is somewhat curious that this  Duke of Buccleuch seeks for his name in  Normandy, and pretends that the original ap-  pellation was I'Escott'. Of the baronet fam-  ily. Scott of Ancrum and Scott of Duninald.  claim to be descended from the renowned  wizard, Michael Scott, who flourished in the  twelfth century, and assert that the Buccleuch  Scotts are the younger branch of this house.  In ancient times the Latin word 'Scotus'' was  applied both to the inhabitants of Ireland and  Scotland, its meaning being similar to that of  '(lael' in the ancient language common to  both countries. Thus the missionaries from  Ireland who civilized and Christianized the  pagan countries of Europe between the sixth  and twelfth centuries were called 'Scoti', the  plural of the Latin word 'Scotus'', wliich  meant a native of Ireland or Scotland. In  Roman and mediaeval times Ireland was  called 'Scotia', and .Scotland was called 'Sco-  tia Minor'. After the eleventh or twelfth  centuries the Scandinavian word of Eircland  or Ireland, displaced throughout Europe in  current phraseology the term .Scoita, which  was henceforth applied to .Scotland alone,  whose other name was Caledonia. Scott is  thus the modern form of the ancient Latin  appellation 'Scotus''.   (I) David Scott, the fir.st ascertainable an-  cestor of the Scott family in America here  dealt with, was born in Dundee, Scotland, and  died there. He had three sons: David, John,  and Thomas, mentioned below.   fll) Thomas, youngest son of David Scott,  married Elizabeth Deuchass, who died in 1763.  The children were : Alexander, Christina.  Margaret, Elizabeth, and David, mentioned  below.   (Ill) David (2), youngest son of Thomas  and Elizabeth (Deuchass) Scott, was born at  Dundee. Scotland, in 1731, died in 1S25 at  Little Britain, Orange county. New York. He  was a weaver in Dundee, and came to this  country in 1788, settling in Little Britain on  part of General Clinton's farm, where he be-  gan and continued to engage in agricultural  pursuits. He was a strong churchman of the     Presbyterian faith. He married Margaret  Cowper (or Cooper) in 1782. The children  were: Elizabeth, born in Scotland, in 1783;  Christina (twin), born in Scotland; IsabelLi  (twin), born in Scotland; William, born in  Orange county. New York; James, mentioned  below ; David, born in Orange county. Nev^  York; Jane, born in Orange county; John R.,  born in Orange county.   (IV) James was the second son of David  (2) and Margfaret (Cowper or Cooper) Scott.   He married Millicent . Their son, David   A., is mentioned below.   (V) David A., son of James and Millicent  Scott, was born in the town of Montgomery,  Orange county. New York. August 18, 1825.  died suddenly at Indian Lake, in the Adiron-  dacks. New York, y\u,srust 24, 1890. During  the interval of sixty-five years covered by  these dates, but more especially during his  active manhood, his experiences and his use-  fulness were varied. After graduating at the  Montgfomery Academy and subsequently at  the Wesleyan University, he taught school for  some years in South Carolina, but ultimately  took up the study of the law in Newburg, and  was admitted to the bar in 18^6. Thirty-four  years of professional life and the manner in  which they were passed won for him not only  reasonable success, but gained for him the re-  spect and esteem of his contemporaries and  the confidence of the public. He w^as not a  great man in any sense, had no eminent rank-  as an attorney or coimsellor. but was never-  theless one whose integrity was without ques-  tion and whose judgment was a safe reliance.  Mr, Scott held the office of surrogate of the  county for two terms (January, i860, to Janu-  ary, 1866) and at their expiration entered  partnership with M. H. Hirschberg. under the  firm name of .Scott & Hirschberg-, in which  relation he remained until his death, devoting  his attention especially to office work, includ-  ing very largely the settlement of estates and  references involving important and compli-  cated questions. Eor the vocation of an advo-  cate he had no marked aptitude, .\side from  his professional life Mr. .Scott took an iiUerest  in the influences in society having for their  object the elevation of his fellows. He was  an active member of St. George's Episcopal  Church, filling acceptably the post of lay  reader when service in that capacity was re-  quired, and also that of superintendent of the     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     297     Sunday-school. When death came to him it  found him in the field promoting the success  of the mission of his church, now the Church  of the Good Shepherd. Next to his church  he was a devotee of the ancient and honorable  order of Free and Accepted Masons, finding  nothing in its principles or ritual that could  reasonably be condemned, and much that un-  der association, had a power and an object  second only to the church itself. He entered  the order in Newburg Lodge, No. 309, in  i860, and passed from it to Hudson River  Lodge in which he received its highest honors.  At different times he was presiding officer of  lodge, chapter, and commandery, and at all  times one of the prominent craftsmen of the  state. His service as a trustee of common  schools from 1887 to the time of his death  was of unquestionable advantage to the  schools and to the public, and in private walks  his charities were many. Regarding Mr.  Scott's life as a whole the evidence is cumu-  lative that he wasted neither his powers nor  his opportunities for usefulness — that the  mean goal, 'thyself', says one writer, 'did not  bound his vision nor confine his hand', — that  the force of his example remains and will re-  main even though his name shall wholly per-  ish.   Mr. Scott married Elizabeth, daughter of  David N. Bradley, who died in 1876. Chil-  dren : \\'illiam Clement, mentioned below ;  James Bratlley.   (\'l) William Clement, son of David A.  and Elizabeth (Bradley) Scott, was born at  Newburg, Orange county. New York, Febru-  ary 21, 1869. He was educated in the public  schools of Newburg, and fitted for college at  Siglar's Preparatory School, Newburg. He  entered Yale University in 1899. ^nd gradu-  ated in the class of 1893, with the degree of  Bachelor of Arts. In a few years he became  connected with the Newburg Planing Mill  Company, and has been secretary and treas-  urer since its incorporation. He is a director  of the National Bank of Newburg, and at-  tends the First Presbyterian Church. He  married, October 20, 1897, Margaret Lefever,  daughter of John and Mary ('\'ain Schoon-  maker. Children : Elizabeth and William C.     The surname Taylor belongs to   TAYLOR the class of what are known as   occupational surnames, that is,     surnames or family names that have been de-  rived from the occupation or work of the orig-  inal ancestor who first bore it, and among  whose descendants it became hereditary. To  this class also belong names like Smith, Gar-  dener, Skinner and Howard in English. Mac-  Gowan (the son of the Smith) in Erse or  Gaelic, Boulanger (Baker) in French, and  Schneider (tailor) in German. This type of  names was very common among the Anglo-  Saxons of England as distinguished from the  Normans, who formed the ruling element, and  who derived their names chiefly from the ter-  ritory with which they had a governing con-  nection. Nor was that type of name common  among the Milesian Gaels or Celts of Ireland  and Scotland, whose habit it was to form fam-  ily names from the personal names of ances-  tors, some near, some remote, at the date of  the establishment, but in the case of the lead-  ing families from the names of ancestors who  lived about the eleventh century, or who took  part in the historic battle of Clontarf. In  Gaelic, it is interesting to note, no family  name derived from trade or an occupation  has ever been known to be preceded by the  Milesian prefix 'O', which never preceded  any but names derived from the personal  names of ancestors. In the case of all Gaelic  names derived from trade, occupation or pro-  fession, or preceded by 'Gil' or 'Kil' (from  'giolla', servant) 'Mac' is the prefix invari-  ably used; for example: MacGowan. which is  known to be the real name of most of the  Smiths of Ireland, altered in many cases as  early as the seventeenth century. A series of  remarkable articles, dealing with the whole  subject of Gaelic surnames, was published by  Dr. O'Donovan. the celebrated translator of  the 'Annals of the Four Masters', in the  defunct Dublin Penny Journal, and these ar-  ticles contain valuable information on occu-  pational surnames. In some cases the name  of Taylor has been derived from a Norman-  French form, 'Taileur', borne by some fami-  lies in England, who have the riglit to bear  arms ; there are, however, a great many fami-  lies in the United Kingdom of the name of  Taylor, who have the right to bear arnis.^ The  name is known in every part of the United  Kingdom, and even on the continent of  Europe under various forms. It by no means  follows that all these names have an identical  origin, that is, derived from an occupational     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     appellation, and it is quite certain that one  Taylor family need not necessarily have any  relationship to another. Thus the application  of the expression, 'the Taylor family', while  correct as applied in a single case, is an obvi-  ous misnomer as applied to all who bear the  name of Taylor. Many Taylors landed in  New England in the seventeenth century and  families were founded in every colony prior  to 1700. Some families of the name settled  in Connecticut, and many of the earlier fami-  lies are also found in New Hampshire. In  the case of some of the English Taylors,  whose descendants now live in Wcstficld, New  York, and elsewhere, the family is of partial  Norman stock, the name, it is claimed, being  a corruption of Taliaferro, who is stated to  have accompanied \Mlliam the Conqueror to  England. Perhaps the first of the name in  America was John Taylor, who came from  Haverhill, .SufTolkshire. England, with Gov-  ernor Winthrop, June 12. 1636. He was lost  in the voyage of the 'Phantom Ship', famous  in prose and poetry, but many of his descend-  ants still live. The arms of one Taylor fam-  ily are thus heraldically described : Per pale  azure, and or, a cheval, between three buck's  heads all counterchanged, on a chief gules two  hounds meeting argent, collared of the second.  (I) Jonathan Taylor came to this country  amount of transactions in various commercial  lines. He did not stay definitely at Tappan,  but in 1791 purchased a tract of land, consist-  ing of one thousand five hundred acres in the  town of Monroe. This became the Central  Valley homestead of the Taylor family; later  he went to Saratoga county. He was a soldier  in Van Nest's regiment. He married a daugh-  ter of Aaron and Annetie (Jaens) Halstead.  Children : Jonathan, Jr. ; Benjamin ; Aaron ;  Isaac, mentioned below ; and Peggy.   (II) Isaac, son of Jonathan Taylor, was  born at Tappan, now Piermont, New Jersey,  about the year 1790, and died at 'Roselawn',  the family homestead in Central Valley. He  was a soldier in the war of 18 12, and was a  witness and partaker in many of the stirring  events of that time. He lived most of his life  on the family homestead, which had been pur-  chased by his father, Jonathan Taylor, and  which he had a large share in developing and  beautifying. This estate has been in the fam-  ily possession for well over a century, and in     its present state it is thus described by one  magazine writer :   'The estate, which this family has occupied for  something hke one hundred and twenty years, bord-  ers on the State Road, about midway between the  village and the Highland Mills. A conspicuous sign,  hanging beneath the trees and bearing the name  Roselawn Inn and Cottages attracts visitors to the  place, although the attention of every road passenger  having an eye for rural beauty and antiquity as  applied to old American homes cannot fail to be  momentarily transfixed and provoked to a question as  to its ownership.'   Isaac was well-to-do, possessing one of the  best kept, most fertile and well-stocked farms  of about one thousand acres that could be seen  in that particular section of Orange county.   He married . Children : Peter B., who   when sixteen opened a general store which he  conducted until 1862, finally settling at New-  burg, Orange county, married Lavinia C,  daughter of Nathan and Mary E. Strong ;  Aaron Halstcafl, mentioned below.   (Ill) Aaron Halstead. son of Isaac Taylor,  was born on the old Taylor homestead, 'Rose-  lawn', November 15, 1831, 'in a room ad-  joining the little office in the old mansion in  which he sits daily at his desk'. He attended  the district schools and was graduated from  Princeton College in the class of 1850. His  brother Peter B. inherited the family home-  stead, but he sold it to Aaron H.. who gave it  the name of 'Roselawn'. As a boy he showed  himself to be a born horseman and at the time  of his death was the oldest breeder df fast  trotting stock in America. It was he who  forty years ago originated horse auction sales  in Orange county, giving to trotting a reputa-  tion which has clung to it ever since, and it  was also he who founded the finest stud of  trotting and pacing horses in the Eastern  States, one that attracted the eyes of this  country and Europe. Czar Nicholas II. of  Russia, and King Humbert of Italy, hearing  of Mr. Taylor's remarkable success as a  breeder, sent their most expert buvers to 'size  up' the Roselawn stud, with which they were  so favorably impressed that they bought some  of the finest stallions bred there. Mr. Taylor's  school days were tmcventfnl but even during  that period he traded in horses in a small way,  and after his school and colleee days were over  he took up in earnest the business that alwavs  possessed for him an irresistible charm. With  a small capital made by judicious investments     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     299     he went to New York and started a livery and  sales stable at Seventh avenue and Broadway,  on the spot where the Times Buildins^ now  stands. This proved a very prosperous ven-  ture, the stable being patronized by the well-  to-do people of that section, which was then  a new and solely residential one. When a  stylish rig was required by any of the fash-  ionable people for the purpose of taking a  spin up the old Harlem Lane as far as Burn-  ham's, the Elm Park Club, or Steve DuBois'  or even to the opera of an evening, Mr. Tay-  lor's stable was considered the proper place to  go to be accommodated in those days. At Du-  Bois' was a balcony from which the passing  parade could be viewed, and this club had  among its members, Commodore Vanderbilt,  Robert Bonner and H. M. Cushman, all prom-  inent horsemen of the day. On the occasion  of the visit of the Prince of Wales, afterwards  Kinf Edward VH. of Ene^land, to this coun-  try. Mr. Taylor was one of the invited guests  at the ball given in the Prince's honor at the  Metropolitan Hotel. At the outbreak of the  civil war Mr. Taylor wound up his livery bus-  iness and joined the Thirty-eighth New York  Regiment, which bore an excellent record  throughout the conflict.   When the war was over he negotiated the  .sale of Roselawn farm, and established a stock  farm on the place, where many of the fastest  trotters and pacers of that dav were bred,  trained and sold. It was at this point that  his life work really began, and during the  years that followed his skill as a breeder was  hrought to the attention of the country and of  the horscbreerling and trotting world. After  carefully devoting his attention for nearly  half a dozen years to the development of a  stud, in 1S72 he inaugurated the annual trot-  tine horse sales at Central Valley. The sale,  while it was of a purely experimental nature,  proved a decided success and brought noted  personages from at home and abroad to par-  take of Mr. Taylor's hospitality. Among Mr.  Tavlor's long list of celebrated horses was one  'Pierson'. who was sired by Rvsdvk's 'Ham-  hletonian', dam by 'Cassius M Clav'. which  horse was disposed of to Mr. David Bonner.  ■'Roselawn'. the home of Mr. Taylor, in ad-  dition to being a place that has been known  to all prominent horsemen and breeders of  fast trotting stock throughout the country for  many years, is also a revolutionary landmark.     The colonial arms under Washington passed  by this house of many gables in the trying  times of '76. Mr. Taylor was a brilliant en-  tertainer and a gentleman of the old school.  He had a vast stock of anecdotes relating to  the vanished figures and the delightful associa-  tions of forty years that proved most pleasing  and entertaining to the visitor. His powers of  memory were very great and he insisted upon  the strictest accuracy when speaking of horses,  their flights of speed, their pedigrees, and the  like, even when the events dealt with hap-  pened as far back as nearly forty years ago.   He married (first) Gertrude Culver of  Brooklyn, New York, who died in 1898,  daughter of John W. Culver. He married  (second) Henrietta, daughter of John E. and  Clara (McLoughlin) Kuntzc. of Charleston.  South Carolina, who after the war came north  and purchased eight hundred acres of land  outside of Springfield, Illinois.     Dr. John Nicoll. the founder of  NICOLL this family, was the son of Al-  exander Nicoll, of Haddieweel,  parish of West Calder, Edinburghshire, Scot-  land. He emigrated to this country about  1734, and died in New York City, October 2,  1743, aged sixty-three years. He married Re-  becca (Dowding) Ransford, of Boston, Mas-  sachusetts. Children: I.

The English familv of  CH.\D\MCK Chadwick originated at  Chadwick. a hamlet in the  neiHiborhnod of Rochdale, county of Lan-  cashire. The arms of the Chadwicks are :  Gules on Escutcheon, within an Orle of Mar-  letts Argent. Crest: A Lily .\rgent Stalkefl  and Leafed Vert. The motto is : /;; Candorc  decus. A branch of the family in Cornwall,  England, bear similar arms, and show the re-  lationship: Crest on a Ducal Coronet of Mar-  lett. Tlierc were Chadwicks from Healey  Hall who came to this country in 1640 and  settled in Massachusetts. It is not, however,  possible at present to ascertain the relation-  ship with them, but it exists nevertheless, as  tlie present owner of Healey Hall is related to  Joseph Chadwick. of this review.   The first of the name of whom there is posi-       ^^a^^^'cJC     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     301     tive information was Nicholas Chadwick, born  about 1340, in the reign of Edward the Third,  and who married Maud, daughter of Thomas  de Paris, acquiring lands in Spotland, Hon-  ersfield and Castleton in Lancashire.   Thomas Chadwick, descendant of Nicholas  Chadwick, was the progenitor of the Chad-  wicks from which the name here dealt with  springs from. He was born in 1535, and the  line from him to the present generation is as  follows: Anthony, born 1580; Thomas, born  1605; Thomas, born 1631 ; Thomas, born  1661 ; Thomas, born 1692; Thomas, born  1713; Thomas, born 1737 (who built one of  the first three cotton mills in Heywood, spin-  ning cotton wool as it was then called, and  purchased an estate called Captain Fold in  1778, this being in the possession of the family  at the present time) ; John, born 1776: Thom-  as, born 1800, and was the father of Joseph,  of whom further.   Joseph Chadwick, the first member of this  family in this country, and a representative of  the Castleton branch, was born at Croft Bank  House, Captain Fold, between Heywood and  Rochdale, Lancashire, England, October 24,  1841. He was educated at Town Head, Roch-  dale. He acquired a practical knowledge of  his present business in Manchester, and cotton  spinning in Rochdale. He came to the United  States in 1865, and shortly afterward secured  a lease of the Boiling Spring Bleach and Dye  Works, New Jersey, conducting the same for  a period of ten years. In 1871 the site of the  Newbursr Rleachery was purchased and the  present buildings erected, these being among  the largest and best equipped of tlie kind in  the country, bleaching, dying and finishing the  finest cotton fabrics made.

One grandson,  Thomas M., born 19 10, and two granddaugh-  ters, Dorothy, born igii, and Barbara, born  1913-     There is no name per-  FITZ (iERALD haps generally recog-  nized as more distinct-  ively Irish than the famous surname of the  Geraldines, yet the name itself is not Milesian  Irish or Gaelic, but Norman French in origin.  A branch of the Fitz Geralds were down to  the reign of Queen Elizabeth of England earls  of Desmond, and had immense ])Osscssions in  that ancient principality, which was later  called Cork and Kerry. Another branch be-  came barons of Offaley, the ancient Gaelic  name for the present King's and Queen's  counties, earls of Kildare, and dukes of Lein-  ster. The Geraldines who arrived in Ireland  from Normandy through England in the  eleventh century in course of time joined the  Irish in their conflicts with England, and were  charged by English writers as having became  Irish in language and customs ; hence the  origin of the expression 'Ipsis Hibernis Hi-  berniores' or 'More Irish than the Irish them-  selves'. The Fitz Geralds wlio were created  earls of Desmond became one of the most  powerful families in Munster, and several of  them were lords deputies of Ireland in the  fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Gerald  Fitz Gerald, the sixteenth earl of Desmond,  was one of the greatest noblemen in Europe:  he held the rank of 'Prince Palatine' with all  the autiiority of a provincial king. Having  resisted the reformation in the reign of Eliza-  beth and waged war against the English gov-  ernment, the forces of the earl of Desmond  were after long contests defeated, and he him-  self was slain in a glen near Castle Island in  the county of Kerry, November 11, 1583; his  head was cut ofif and sent to England by  Thomas Butler, earl of Ormond. as a present  to Queen Elizabeth, who caused it to be fixed  on London Bridge. James Fitz Gerald,  nephew of Gerald, earl of Desmond, attempt-  ing to recover the estates and honors of his  ancestors, took up arms and joined the stand-  ard of Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tvrone, and  claimant to the monarchy of Ireland. This  Tames Fitz Gerald was styled earl of Des-     302     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     mond, but the title not being recognized by  the English, he was designated by them as the  'sugan earl', which signifies the 'earl of  straw'. His forces being at length defeated  and he himself taken prisoner he was sent to  England along with Florence Mac Carthy,  heir of the ancient kings of Munster, and im-  prisoned in the Tower of London, where he  died in 1608, and thus the illustrious house of  Fitz Gerald was brought low. The vast es-  tates of the family were confiscated in the  reign of Queen Elizabeth and divided up  among various English settlers, and the old  proprietors were reduced to tilling the soil on  their ancient patrimony.   The Geraldines, as this great family are  often called, claim to be descended in the line  along which they derive their surname, from  the same stock as the Gherardini, a noble  Florentine family, whose progenitor, Raina-  riao, flourished in A. D. 910. It is, however,  sufificient for the antiquity of this distin-  guished race to state that their pedigree is  perfect up to Otho, who passed into England  before the Conquest. The name itself is de-  rived from that chief's descendant, Maurice,  the son of Gerald (filius Geroldi), and great-  grandson of Otho. Maurice Fitz Gerald ac-  companied the Normans in their eleventh cen-  tury invasion of Ireland, and thus built up the  fortunes of the family. 'Fitz' is a Norman  French prefix and signifies son, being a con-  traction of the_ Latin 'filius' or French 'fils'.  Like 'Ap' among the Welsh, and 'Mac' and  'O' among the Milesian Irish, the Fitz prefix  to the father's name was the only surname in  use for a period among noble families. The  origin of the word 'Fitz', which has much  puzzled some antiquarians, is this : In con-  tracting the word 'filius', the old scribes drew  a stroke across the '1' to denote the omission  of the following 'i', and thus assimilated it  in form to the letter 't''. The character 'z'  is the usual contraction of 'us'. Then the  word looked like 'fitz', and came to be so  pronounced. The armorial bearings of the  Fitz Geralds of the house of Desmond are  thus heraldically described: Ermine a saltire  gules. Crest : A boar passant, ermine fretting  gules. Supporters: Two male griffins argent  chained and spiked on the breast and shoulders  or. Motto: Crom Aboo.   The following is the pedigree of the family  through sixteen generations as deduced from     the Linea Antiqua and other authentic  sources :   (I) Otho Geraldino, according to the Battle  Abbey Book, went into England from Nor-  mandy with William the Conqueror and was  one of his chief commanders, and, according  to Sir William Dugale's 'Baronage of Eng-  land' was the sixth of that king, created a  baron. This Otho had two sons, Waltero and  Robert. Waltero was the ancestor of all the  Fitz (ieralds of Ireland, and of all the barons  of Windsor until the male issue of the Wind-  sor line became extinct.   (II) Waltero, son of Otho Geraldino.  (HI) Gerald, from whom the surname of   Geraldine was changed to Fitz Gerald.   (IV) Maurice Fitz Gerald was the first to  assume the name of Gerald, which thus be-  came hereditary. He was one of the first and  principal invaders of Ireland, A. D. 1169.  From this Maurice descended the two prin-  cipal lines of the earls of Desmond and the  dukes of Leinster.   (V) Gerald Fitz Gerald.   (VI) Maurice.   (VII) Thomas, baron of Geashill, was the  first of the family to get into Kildare, where  he built the Castle of Geashill, and was made  baron, as he was also of Sligo, Tirconnell and  Kerry.   (VIII) John, the first carl of Kildare.   (IX) Thomas, second earl, died 1390.   (X) Maurice, fourth earl, died 1410.   (XI) John Cam, sixth earl, died 1427.   (XII) Thomas, seventh earl, died 1477.   (XIII) Gerald, eighth earl.   (XIV) Gerald Oge, ninth earl, was im-  peached of high treason, and in September,  1534, died in the Tower of London. 'Silken  Thomas', the famous general, who died in  1537, was the tenth earl.   (XV) Edward, second son of Gerald Oge.  The Fitz Gerald pedigree is brought down   through a great many branches to the present  day.   (I) Tohn Fitz Gerald lived near Sterling,  New York, where he was a farmer. He  owned several acres of land, and engaged to  a certain extent in commercial pursuits. He  married and had children : John. .Mbert. Ho-  ratio. William. Sydney, mentioned below ;  Tames. Joshua.

Les-  lie A., born in iSgr ; now attending the Stout  Institute, Menominee, Wisconsin.     This surname appears to be  FITCHETT French. The Fitchetts were  of French origin. The im-  migrant ancestor of this family in America  probably came here early in the eighteenth  century. During the Wyoming massacre the  family was driven from Pennsylvania. One  division of it went south and located on the  eastern shore of Maryland. Another division  went with stock across the Delaware, and then,  going up the Hudson river, settled in Pough-  kecpsie. New York. Another party settled at  Coxsackie, New York, and some of its mem-  bers went on to East Troy, New York, and  so on to Canada. Thus traces of the family  can be found in all the places mentioned above,  though the exact links binding them tofrether  elude research. One branch of the family  settled in Canada, while members of other  branches are found in Pennsylvania, New  York, and in the west and south. The most  that can be done is to follow individual lines  back for some generations, with tlie ultimate  hor)e that the links mav be eventually com-  bined, nresuming that there was a common  orif^in in the majority of cases.   (I) Tames Fitchett, the first ascertainable  •ancestor of the Fitchett family in America     here under consideration, was born in town  of Nanticoke, Westmoreland county, now Lu-  zerne county, Pennsylvania, July 25, 1776,  died March 4, 1862. He lived at the begin-  ning of the nineteenth century on the old road  leading out of Poughkeepsie. Not very much  is on record in regard to him, though he  appears to have been a man well known and  highly respected on the country side. He was  engaged in agricultural pursuits. There is no  evidence that he ever held or sought to hold  any public position, though he took a consid-  erable interest in public affairs. He married  Susan Myers, born September 18, 1782, died  July 31, 1846. He had fourteen children,  among whom was Charles Harvey, mentioned  below.

This name and the family hear-  SCHEK ing it are German in origin. It  is not an old American name.  not figuring in the li.sts of that older Ger-  man emigration that directed itself towards     3o6     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Pennsylvania and adjoining states in the;  eighteenth century. The founder of this  family in America came here in the nine-  teenth century, and the present is the third  generation descended from him. Brief as  its history on American soil is compared  with that of the older families of New Eng-  land and New York it has been a praise-  worthy record, full of creditable accomplish-  ment and full of promise for the future.   (I) Ignatius Schek, the immigrant an-  cestor in America of the family here dealt  with, was born in \\'urtembcrg, ( iermany,  March 14, 1817, died June 18, 1887, in Bar-  donia, New York.

He  was a carpenter and cabinetmaker by occu-  pation in Germany, but he had a knowl-  edge of other trades and considerable ver-  satility. Therefore when he came to Amer-  ica he did not altogether follow the trade  to which he had been for the most part  accustomed in Germany, but seeing that the  growing populations and industry of the  towns and villages in New York state were  in need of continually enlarging accommo-  dations he determined to engage in the  building business. .A.ccordingly he estab-  lished himself in the business of builder  and contractor in the town of Clarkstown,  and there spent nearly the whole of his life  on American soil and it was near there that  he died.

All of the  settlers were German Palatines and be-  longed to the Reformed church. Matthias  and Philip Millspaugh were naturalized bv  the New York assembly in 1735. In 1768-78     Philip and Jacob Millspaugh were living in  Montgomery. In 1790 the family had multi-  plied greatly, but had remained in Mont-  gomery. In that year, according to the first  federal census, the following were heads of  families there: Abraham, Adam, Benjamin,  Christopher, Daniel, Frederick, Isaac, Jacob,  Jacob Jr., Johannis, John, Peter, Philip Sr.,  and Philip Jr. But one will of a Millspaugh  is on record before 1800 in Ulster county.  Stephen Millspaugh, of Montgomery, yeo-  man, made his will March 19, 1789, and be-  queathed to Jonathan, eldest son of his  brother Matthias, and to Philip, son of his  brother Philip. The will was proved May   5. 1789-   The surname is found in the early records  of Orange and the adjacent counties as  Miltzpatch, Miltzpach and Milsbagh. The  immigrants bearing the name were from  both Germany and Holland, and in some  cases they came to the United States with  grown-up families. The valley of the Wall-  kill was settled by German, Dutch, and  French emigrants, who, being frugal and in-  dustrious, very soon became possessed of  competence and wealth. Of the Millspaugh  family that settled in Orange county, Jacob,  the father, was evidently an old man, as  the records do not mention any land pos-  sessed by him. The printed records begin  with Matthias, his son, who was born in  Germany or Holland, as the Journal of the  New York Assembly for 1735 shows a bill  for the naturalizaiiuu of several persons,  among them Matthias Milsbagh, Philip  Milsbagh and otheis.   Philip served as a soldier in the revolu-  tionary war. His children were Frederick,  Moses, David. Levins. Jeremiah, and Mary.  Jeremiah married Sallie Crist, November 30,  1800, she having been born on February 24,  1779, dving January 31, 1847. There were  five children of this marriage, two of whom  died in infancy; those who grew to adult  life were: Gilbert who became a tailor;  Harvey, al.so a tailor: and Catherine Ann.  It is possible that the family here dealt with  is descended from this Jeremiah, though the  exact links have not as yet been traced.   (I) Renwick Millspaugh. undoubtedly a  member of the Millspaugh family whose  earlier generations are outlined above, was  born at the city of Newburgh, Orange coun-     3o8     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     ty, New York, May 28, 1830, died September  19, 1885. He was educated in the common  schools, and was an auctioneer and furniture  dealer all his life. He took considerable in-  terest in the public affairs of his city, state  and nation, though he did not hold any pub-  lic office. He was an attendant of the Meth-  odist Episcopal church. He married, in  1854, Emma Young, born October 11, 1836,  died in February, 1885. Children: i. Wil-  liam, died in infancy. 2. Ida, died in infancy.  3. Eva, died in infancy. 4. Caroline, now a  teacher in a Washington public school. 5.  Thomas H., of whom further.   (H) Thomas H., son of Renwick and Em-  ma (Young) Millspaugh, was born October  8, 1865, in the city of Newburgh, Orange  county. New York. He graduated from the  Newburgh Academy in 1882, and was an  assistant to his father until 1887. when he  became connected with H. C. Higginson.  In 1899 the Higginson Manufacturing Com-  pany was organized and he was made secre-  tary of the company. On Mr. Higginson's  retirement in icpg Mr. Millspaugh became  president of the company, a position he still  holds. Mr. Millspaugh is a member of the  Newburgh Lodge, No. 309, Free and Ac-  cepted Masons, and was its master in 1895;  Highland Chapter, No. 52, Royal Arch  Masons ; Hudson Commandery, No. 35 ;  Ringold Hose Company: and the City and  Wheelman's Club, of Newburgh. Orange  county. New York.   He married, on April 13. 1887, Frances,  daughter of Charles and Frances (Green)  Moss, of the city of Newburgh. There has  been one son by this marriage, Kenneth R.     The surname SenflF is German  SENFF in origin. In the German   'Senf' means 'mustard', and it  is probably from that word that the surname  is derived. In Germany the name has been  borne bv many noble families and to it are  attached several coats-of-arms. It is a prev-  alent name in Germany and Holland, but is  not borne very extensively in this country.  Doubtless a number of the German immi-  grants who came to this country in large  numbers in the eighteenth century brought  the name with them, but the family here  dealt with is only here in the third genera-  tion, the grandfather of the youngest gener-     ation having been the immigrant ancestor in  this country.   (I) Henry Senfif, M.D., the immigrant an-  cestor in America of the Senfif family here  dealt with, was born in Briickeburg,  Schaumberg Lippe, Germany, April 4, 1804,  died May 5. 1868, in New York City. He  came to this country in 1832 and settled in  New York City. He was engaged in the  drug business and secured employment in  that line, but later he studied medicine and  surgery, graduated from New York Col-  lege of Physicians and Surgeons, and be-  came, when he had completed the course,  assistant surgeon at West Point. While at  West Point he was private tutor to Robert  E. Lee, and was a prominent Abolitionist.  He remained there two years, and then re-  turned to New York. He practiced his pro-  fession in the city and became prominent.  He married, June 7, 1838, Susan W., daugh-  ter of Frederick C. and Catherine (Billigar')  Havemeyer. Children : Louise L., married,  July T2, i860. Dr. Edward E. Lee; Charles  H., died August 23, 191 1; Frederick \\'.,  mentioned below.   (II) Frederick W.. younger son of Dr.  Henry and Susan W. (Havemeyer) SenfF.  was born in New York City. August i. 1840.  He was educated in the public schools and  in the New York Free Academy. For about  two years he was in the drv goods business,  and in 1868 he went to Europe, where he  studied chemistry. On his return he settled  in New Windsor. Orange county. New  York, where he now lives, though he has  never practiced his profession on accoimt of  his eyes. Mr. SenflF is vice-president and  director of the Newburg Savings Rank,  member of the board of managers at St.  Luke's Hospital, member of the Citv and  Auto clubs at Newburg, and a member of  the Reformed Club, New York City. He  married, October 23, 1878, Geor.giana Have-  meyer. There has been one daughter of the  marriage. Louise S.. who married Kenneth  Cameron, of Newburg, Orange county. New  York.     The Stokes family would nn-  STOKES near to be of Norman origin.   following the derivation of the  surname, a branch of the ancieiU and illustri-  ous house of Montespedon. Several of its     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     309     members went to England from Normandy  soon after the conquest by William in the  eleventh century and there obtained large pos-  sessions and were people of high standing.  The surname was known under various forms  in both England and Ireland. A Sir Adam de  Stokke was seized of the manors of Stokke  and Rutishall. Wiltshire, England, about 1300.  His son, Thomas de Stokke, held the manor of  .Sende with other lands in Wiltshire. John  Stokes represented Wiltshire in parliament in  the time of Charles H. John Stokes, of Dun-  moylan House, county of Limerick, about the  year 1622, married Sara O'Conail, daughter  of Jefferey O'Conail, and granddaughter of   !Da or Daid O'Conail, of Iveraigh, their de-  scendants still retaining the family seats at  Tralee and Cullenymore in Ireland. From the  year 1201, the third of the reign of King John  of England, to 1357, the thirty-first of the  reign of King Edward HI., a period of over   Sone hundred and fifty years, we find in the  records of the Acts of the succeeding kings  that the members of the Stokes family were  connected with the various courts, being called  as witnesses to important state papers as char-  t ters, letters patent, etc., showing that they  I; stood high in the esteem and confidence of the  various monarchs. Lower sa\s that the sur-  name Stokes is in its origin simply a plurali-  zation of the name Stoke.   ( I ) Thomas Stokes, the first American an-  cestor of the Stokes family here dealt with,  was born in London in 1765, the son of Wil-  liam Stokes, of that city, and died in New  York City, October 10, 1832, aged sixty-seven  years. He came to New York in 1798 and  became one of the most distinguished men of  that generation in philanthropic and religious  work. Before coming to this country he was  a merchant of considerable wealth and one of  the founders of the Lond'^n Missionary So-  ciety. In this country h_ was one of the  founders of the American Bible Society, the  New York Peace Society, and the American  Tract Society. He had been accustomed to  preach to the poor of London, though he was  not a reeularly ordained minister. He was  as'iociated with Robert Raikes in his earliest  efforts to organize Sunday-schools in the city  of London and its suburbs. On arriving in  New York he was baptized in the East river  by the Rev. Charles Lahatt. pastor of the  Bethel Baptist Church of New York. When     by the efiforts of Archibald Maclay the Mul-  berry Street Baptist Church was gathered Mr.  Stokes united with the body and was at once  elected deacon, an office which he held until  the time of his death. 'The General Conven-  tion', which was the first organization of the  American Baptists for the promotion of for-  eign missions, was formed in Philadelphia,  May 21, 1814, Mr. Stokes was present, a  deeply interested spectator. When in 1821, in  consequence of failing health, John Caldwell,  the treasurer of the Baptist Missionary Con-  vention, was compelled to resign, Mr. Stokes  consented to undertake the duties of the posi-  tion which, however, he resigned two years  later desiring that the trea.surcr be located at  Boston. In 1825 he assisted in the organiza-  tion of the Tract Society and was placed upon  its board of managers.   He married Elizabeth Ann, daughter of  James Boulter, of Lowestoft. England. Chil-  dren: Thomas Boulter; Richard Arnold, died  young; William Armstrong, died young; Eliz-  abeth Ann, married John Dickcrson ; Edward  Halesworth ; Alfred Arnold; James Boulter,  mentioned below ; Sarah, married Charles Col-  gate ; Henry; Josiah ; William .Armstrong;  Mary, married Clinton Gilbert ; Benaiah Gibb.  (IF) James Boulter, the fifth son of Thomas  and Elizabeth .Ann (Boulter) Stokes, was bom  in 1804. died in 1881. Early in life he was  engaged in business with his father, but later  became a member of the firm of importers of  Phelps, Dodge & Company, .\fter remaining  in this business connection for about forty-one  years he assisted in establishing the banking  house of Phelps, Stokes & Company. Being  greatly interested in charitable and religious  institutions, he contributed generously to their  support and was associated with Peter Cooper  and others in the development of the public  school system. He married, in 1837, Caroline,  daughter of Anson G. Phelps, who was de-  scended in the sixth generation from George  Phelps, the pioneer, who was one of the set-  tlers of Windsor. Connecticut. Children : An-  son Phelps, mentioned below ; James Jr. ;  Thomas ; William E. Dodge ; Elizabeth James,  married Francis H. Slade; Olivia Egleston  Phelps ; Dora, married Henry Dale ; Caroline  Phelps.   (HI) Anson Phelps, eldest son of James  Boulter and Caroline (Phelps) Stokes, was  born in New York City, in 1838. He was a     3IO     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     partner in Phelps, Dodge & Company, and  afterwards in the banking business of I'helps,  Stokes & Company, with his father. Later he  was principally occupied in looking after his  real estate and other investments. He is or  has been a member of the Tuxedo, Metropoli-  tan, Knickerbocker, Union League, City, Law-  yers, Reform, New York Yacht, Seawanhaka-  Coriiithian Vacht, Riding, City and Church  ■ clubs, the Century Association, the National  Academy of Design, and Society of Colonial  Wars, and patron of the Metropolitan Mu-  seum of Art, and the American Museum of  Natural History. He was twice vice-commo-  dore of the New York Yacht Club, and was  first president of the Reform Club. He wrote  •'loint-Metallism', of which many editions  have been published. He married, October 17,  1865, Helen Louisa, daughter of Isaac Newton  Phelps, who was descended in the sixth gen-  eration from George Phelps, of Windsor, the  ancestor of her husbands' mother. Children :  L N. Phelps; J. G. Phelps, graduated from  Yale in 1892; Anson Phelps Jr., graduated  from Yale University in 1896; PLirold M.  Phelps, graduated from Yale University. 1909;  Sarah Phelps, married Baron Halkett ; Helen  Olivia Phelps; Ethel V. Phelps, married John  Sherman Hoyt ; Caroline M. Phelps, married  Robert Hunter; Mildred Phelps, married Dr.  Kausoni .^])afor(l Hooker.   (The Phelps Line.)   The modern surname of Phelps is spelled in  the Massachusetts colonial records as Feljjs,  Phelips and Phelps. It is a name well known  in England, Ireland and Scotland, and is a  variation of Philips, an ancestral cognomen  meaning the 'son of Philip', and is in many  cases an anglicized form of the Gaelic Mac  Philib.   (I) George Phelps emigrated to America in  i6-^o. whence there is no record, but supposed-  ly from Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, Eng-  land, where a family of the name was living  at that time. He was born about the year  1606, died May 8, 1687, at Westfield. From  the Dorchester, Massachusetts, records we  learn that 'January 1632 George Phelps with  others is to have a great lot of six acres a  piece'. In 1634 he was chosen one of the ten  men 'to order the afl'airs of the colony for one  vear' and in 1635 he was chosen freeman. He  located at Windsor in 1635 and in later years  he served on the jurj' both in Hartford and     Springfield, Massachusetts. He married  (nrst) at Windsor in 1637, Phillury, daughter  of Philip Randall, who died in 1648; (second)  in 1 048, Frances Dewey, a widow. Children  by first marriage : Isaac, born in 1638, mar-  iied Anne Gay lord ; a child, died m 1647;  Abraham, born in 1641, married Mary Pm-  ney; a child, died in 1O47; Joseph, mentioned  beiow. Children by second marriage: Abi-  gail, born in 1969; jacob. married Dorothy In-  gersoll; John, married Sarah Buckland; Na-  thaniel, born in 1653.   (II) Joseph, son of George and Phillury  (Randall) Phelps, was born at Windsor, Con- .  necticut. June 24. 1647, died at East Windsor  in i(x)^. He settled in Westfield, Massachu-  setts, and removed to the east side of the  Great river ( Connecticut ) and was among the  first settlers of East Windsor, now South  Windsor, Connecticut. It would appear that  the company to which Joseph Phelps belonged  owned lands in East Windsor previous to this  date, but returned to Westfield during the  Indian troubles. Joseph Phelps, who had be-  come a captain of the militia, was made a  freeman in 1672. He married (first) June  26, 1673. in Westfield, Massachusetts, Mary,  daughter of John and Mary (Stanley) Por-  ter; (second) Hester, daughter of John and  Phillury (Thrall) Hosford!'

He  joined the church in 1700, and Abigail Bissell,  afterwards his wife, joined the church at the  =ame time. At that time the Rev. Timothy  Edwards was pastor of the East Windsor  church and in his rate book he carefullv uses     312     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     daughter of Gerrit Eshuysen, and (third) Eg-  bertje, daughter of Dirck Hage Bruynsen,  who died September 9, 1728.

He married Annetje Smith van Bos-  wijck, who died between October 6 and 30,  1745, and from the signature to her will we  get the first record of the modern spelling of  the name as 'Bush.' Children: i. Annatje. bap-  tized luly 3, 1698. died young. 2. Justus, bap-  tized December 3, 1699 ; ancestor of the Green-  wich, Connecticut, branch of the fainilv. 3.

Abraham, baptized Feb-  ruary 17, 1720; married Ruth Lyon, the an-  cestor of the Westchester county branch of  the family.   (IV) Henricus, son of Justus and Annetje  Smith (van Boswijck) Bush, was baptized in  the Dutch church in New York City, July 2,  1706. According to family tradition he is the  ancestor of the Orange county. New York,  branch of the family, but the records at pres-  ent accessible are not sufficient to determine  the question positively, as his brothers Al-  bertus, Johannes, Bernardus and Isaac also  removed from Westchester county and the  branches descending from them have not yet  been discovered. One of these brothers, how-  e\er, had a son Henry, referred to below.   (V) Henry, probably the son of Henricus,  and certainly the grandson of Justus and An-  netje Smith (van Boswijck) Bush, settled on  what is known as the old Donovan place in  Hempstead, now Sloatsburg, Rockland coun-  ty. New York, in 1760. He served as a soldier  in the revolution. One family tradition states  that he came to -Sloatsburg from Greenwich,  New Jersey, but this is manifestly an error  and arises from a confusion of the south  Jersey town with the Connecticut town of the  same name where Henry's uncle, Justus, had  settled. The records of Greenwich, Connecti-  cut, also prove that Henry could not have  been the son of Justus, but must have been  his nephew. He married Rachel De Graw.  Children : Rachel, Martha, Rebecca, Mar-  garet, Samuel. John, Peter, referred to below ;  Henry. William.   (VI) Peter, son of Henry and Rachel (De  Graw) Bush, was bom in Sloatsburg.

The rose has in all ages been re-  garded as the 'Queen of Flowers', and as  such has ever been associated with poetrv and  symbolism. It may have become a surname  from the device of the original bearer whether     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     315     displayed upon a patrician banner or on a sign  post. Salverte mentions a noble family of  i-'oland in tne twelfth century who were  known to have adopted their surname, Rose,  from the device on their shield, and he ad-  duces other instances of a similar practice.  The Roses of Nairnshire, Scotland, settled  there from the time of Alexander Hi., origi-  nally wrote themselves De Roos, signifymg  something of a Dutch origin. Hugh Rose, ot  Geddes, by marriage with the heiress of Byset,  acquired the lands of Kilravock, and had a  crown charter of the barony from King John  Baliol. The water-Bougets, borne by tne an-  cient Lords De Roos of Hamlake. are found  in the arms of many families of Ross and  Rose, showing at least a presumed community  of origin and name. In the Hundred Roll of  England we find De La Rose, uie meaning of  which is not clear. In the same record Eil'  Rose is also met with, so that Rose rnust have  been a personal name. In Ireland and often  in Scotland Rose and Ross are in many cases  derived from the ancient surname, O'Ruis,  anglicized Ross and Rush (see 'O'Hart's  Pedigrees', vol. I). To Ross is attributed  other origins. In Doomesday Book there was  in Kent, England, a tenant called Anschibil de  Ros, and in Buckinghamshire another named  Ansgobus de Ros. These probably came from  Ros, a commune in the arrondissement of  Caen, France. It is sometimes of local British  origin. The barons Ros or Rose of Hamlake,  county Yorkshire, England, sprang from one  Peter, who in the reign of Henry I., assumed  his surname from the lordship of Ros. There  are several towns in North and South Britain  of the name of Ross, and surnames, Ross and  Rose, have sometimes been derived from these,  which are probably from the Gaelic or Erse  word 'Ros', meaning 'a promontorv''. In  some cases the name had reference to the com-  plexion of the original bearer and may have  been a modification of the word meaning 'red'  in various languages, as, Le Rous, Rufus,  Ruadh. There is no doubt that in many cases  Rose is simply a modification of Ross. Fer-  guson claims that Ross is Teutonic in origin,  deriving it from Old Saxon 'hros'. Old  Norse, 'hross', etc., meaning 'a Horse'.  Skene maintains, however, that the name is  Gaelic in origin. 'It is well known', he says,  'that the surname Ross has always been ren-  dered in Gaelic, Clan Aurias, or Clan Gille     Aurias'. Here in America both Ross and  Rose are often derived from the Dutch sur-  names, Roosa and Roos. It is not improbable  that Rose, in the case of the family here dealt  with, is derived from one of these Dutch sur-  names, the tradition being that it is of Holland  descent.   (i) Jacob Rose was born about the tinu  of the revolutionary war, and was an agricul-  turist of Ulster county, New York. Little is  known regarding the details of his life, but  he was a successful farmer, and was a man  of character and ability. He gathered to-  gether a considerable competency, as repre-  sented in the property he owned, and engaged  to some extent in various commercial pursuits.   (II) John, son of Jacob Ro.se, was born in  Ulster county. New York, in the early years  of the nineteenth century, died at Poughkeep-  sie, Dutchess county. New York, at the age  of seventy-nine. He owned a goodly number  of acres, operated a farm, and at the samo  time carried on the work of a blacksmith's  shop. He married Sybil, born in Ulster coun-  ty, New York, daughter of John Beaver. John  Beaver was one of the proprietors of the  town of Esopus, New York, and was a very  wealthy man in his day. He married a Miss  Clark, who came from an old New England  family. Mrs. Rose, who was a devout mem-  ber of the Methodist Episcopal church, died at  the age of eighty-two. Children : Hilend,  Oscar, Sally, John C, mentioned below, Reu-  ben, Benjamin, Levi, Frances.   (III) John C, third son of John and Sybil  (Beaver) Rose, was born at Esopus, Ulster  county, New York, October 4, 1828, died in  1896. He was one of the leading examples  of the self-made men of Orange county, and  was proprietor of the village and brickyards  of Roseton, which were situated about six  miles north of the city of Newburg on the  West Shore railroad. His success was large-  ly the result of his idea that barges for trans-  portinsj brick could be constructed in a cheap  and easy manner, and this plan he successfully  carried into effect. He owned sixteen brick  machines and had a bank of the finest clay for  the purpose. He was educated at the district  schools of his home neighborhood. He con-  tinued to reside in Dutchess county until 1865,  when he removed with his family to Haver-  straw, where he embarked in the manufacture  of brick in partnership with his brother. Hi-     3i6     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     lend Rose. A year later he sold out his inter-  est and engaged in the construction of barges  for the transportation of brick. The first  barge thus made was called the 'Silas G.  Mackay' and the second 'Hilend C. Rose',  after which many others were built in rapid  succession. In the year 1875 Mr. John C.  Rose resumed the manufacture of brick at  Haverstraw where he had six machines, and  this plant he continued to operate uninter-  ruptedly until 18S2, in which year he sold out.  He was then compelled through failing health  to travel in Europe for part of a year, receiv-  ing great benefit. In the year 1883 he once  more embarked in business near Newburg,  where he purchased a large tract of land, buy-  ing out various parties, until he owned nearly  three hundred acres. His sixteen brick ma-  chines had a capacity of twenty-four thou-  sand bricks per day each, and the two en-  gines which ran the same were of one  hundred and one hundred and seventy  horse power respectively. On an average  about forty million bricks were turned  out of the factory annually, the larger number  of them being shipped to New York City by  barges. After locating at Newburg Mr. Rose  secured a postofifice which was called in his  honor Roscton, and his son, Hilend C, was  appointed first postmaster. Another son, -Al-  bert, became an incumbent of the postoffice.  In 1884 the firm of Rose & Company was in-  corporated with a capital of ninety thousand  dollars, Mr. John C. Rose being president and  treasurer, and his son, Hilend C, being vice-  president and secretary. Mr. John C. Rose  was a member of the Methodist Episcopal  church in which he held various offices and  was superintendent of the Sunday school. He  was active in the ranks of the Prohibition  party; was a trustee of the national funds,  chairman of the county committee, and helped  to nominate candidates for different offices of  importance.   He married (first) Phoebe Myers, who died  in 1870, daughter of William Myers, a farmer  in the county. The marriaee took place in  1856 in Dutchess countv. New York. He  married (second) at Marlboro, Ulster county.  New York, in the year 1873, Martha, daughter  of John Pj. and Maud (Barclay) Railey. He  married (third) Martha Miller. Children by  first marriage: Addie J., married Dr. Seidler,  of Newark, New Jersey ; Albert Duane, de-     ceased, married Madeline Shurter; Hilend C,  mentioned below; Joseph H., mentioned below.  (IVj Hilend C, son of John C. anil Phoebe  (Myers) Rose, was born at Haverstraw, New  York, August 3, i860, died September 22,  1894, at Newburg, Orange county, New York.  He was educated in the public schools of  Haverstraw, and by a private tutor, Professor  Davison, of Yonkers. New York, an uncle of  his future wife. Early in life he became  associated with his father in the brick busi-  ness, and in 1883 he became a partner of his  father and began the manufacture of brick at  what is now Roseton. He was at one time  president of the company. He sold out his  interests in 1892 to the Rose family on account  of failing health. It was due largely to his  perseverance and skill that the business of  the company was built up to its high standard  at the time he retired in 1892. He was a  member of the Presbyterian church (Union)  at Newburg. and young as he was at the time  of his death was already a well known and  respected figure in his community. He mar-  ried. December 21,. i88g. Emma, daughter of  Dr. Benjamin and Margaret (West) Davison,  of Nyack, New York, where Dr. Davison was  a well known and prominent physician. There  were two children of the marriage: Sybil,  who died in infancy; Hilend Clark, who is  now attending the Hotchkiss School.   (IV) Joseph H.. youngest son of John C.  and Phoebe (Myers) Rose, was born at New  Hamburg, New York, September 2, 1865. He  was educated in the public schools of Haver-  straw, and at the Mountain Institute, Haver-  straw. He became associated with his father  early in life in the brick business and this con-  tinued until the death of his father in 1896,  when he succeeded him as president of the  firm. He continued in this cai)acity until  the year 1903, when he retired from  active business life. Mr. Joseph H. Rose  is a director of the Newburg National  Bank. He is a member of the City and Pow-  cllton clubs ; Hudson River Lod.ge, No. 607,  Free and Accepted Masons ; Highland Chap-  ter, No. 52, Royal Arch Masons; Hudson  River Commandery, No. 35, Newburg; and  the Elks, No. 247. Mr. Rose married. June  13. 189T. Mabel, daughter of Samuel Corwin,  of Marlboro, New York. There has been one  child of the marriage, Joseph H. Jr.     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     317     This surname is Ger-  RHINELANDER man in origin and in   its original form was  written 'Rheinlander'. Its obvious meaning  was 'a native of the Rhincland', and it was  probably applied centuries ago to the original  bearer after he had emigrated from the region  around to some other German speaking part  of the European continent. It is quite easy   tto surmise how such a surname arose, being  i akin in its origin to family names in Germany  like 'Englander', meaning 'the Englishman',  'Spanier'. meaning the 'Spaniard', the  French 'Allemand', meaning 'the German',  and 'Scott', meaning the 'Gael', and so on.  It .is obvious that the name Rheinlander is  li German in origin, as the family lived on the  Rhine for centuries before the French an-  nexed it in the time of the Louis, and it could  only be a person bearing the distinct and  different national characteristics of that re-  gion. In the same way the surname 'Scott'  though English itself must have been applied  in the case of the original bearer to one, who  thousfh living in England, had come from some  Gaelic speaking part of what is now the Unit-  ed Kingdom and bearing the characteristics of  the Gael, for through Roman and medireval  times the term 'Scoti' or 'Scots' was applied  to the inhabitants of Ireland and of Scotland  indiscriminately, the singular form 'Scotus',  meanintj either 'Irishman' or 'Scotsman' in  old Latin. Names therefore like Rhinelander  and Scot, the one in German, and the other in  Enelish, have an exactly parallel origin, being  at first a sobriquet to distinguish a particular  individual, being then applied to his children,  and so becoming permanent and hereditary.  The name of Rhinelander has been conspicu-  ously identified with the past two hundred  years of New York's history.   (I) Philip Jacob Rhinelander, the first of  the Rhinelander family in this country, was  born near the town of Oberwesel, on the  Rhine, over which district France at that time  held sovereignty, and died about 17,^7. at New  Rochelle, Westchester county. New York. He  arrived in New York in the year i6?6, follow-  ing the troubles arising from the Revocation  of the Edict of Nantes, and finally settled in  New Rochelle, where he acquired considerable  property. His children were : Philin Jacob :  Bernard, among whose children were \\'illiam.  born in 1745. married Hester Devaux and had     a daughter called Mary Magdalen, and Jacob,  born October 27, 1740, dying without issue;  William, mentioned below.   (II) William, son of Philip J. Rhinelander,  was born in New Rochelle, Westchester coun-  ty. New York, in 1718, died in New York  City, in 1777, being buried in Trinity church-  yard. \\illiam Rhinelander established him-  self as a merchant in New York City, and he  is the ancestor of the members of the Rhine-  lander family who have been prominent. He  purchased and long resided in a house on  Spruce street upon land which is still in the  possession of the family and which is the old-  est Rhinelander property in New York. He  was in the shipping and real estate business,  and established the precedent of investing his  estate in city realty. He married Magdalen,  daughter of Stephen Renaud, of New Ro-  chelle   (III) William (2), son of William (i) and  Maedalcn (Renaud) Rhinelander, was born  in New York, in 1753, died in 1825. He was  the trustee of the family estate, and like his  ancestors and descendants was an extensive  land owner. He was his father's partner,  while the latter was in business, succeeding  him when he died, and continued his policy of  investing in city realty. In 1790 he purchased  the Cuyler sugar house in New York, which  was sold under forfeiture, having been used  as a British prison during the revolution, and  succeeded in adding- greatly to the family for-  tunes as a buyer of real estate. He married,  in 1785. Mary, daughter of Christopher and  Mary (Dyer) Robert, sister of Colonel Rob-  ert, a continental officer in the revolution, and  great-granddaughter of Daniel Robert and  Susanna (Du Gailean) Robert, Husruenots.  who emigrated to America in 1686. She was  also the aunt of Christopher Rhinelander Rob-  ert, who founded Robert College in Constanti-  nople. Children: A daughter, married Ho-  ratio Gates Steven-; : a daughter, married Rob-  ert T. Renwick; Philip, married Mary Colden  Hofifman ; William Christopher, mentioned be-  low. John Robert, married but left no issue;  Frederick William, whose son and grandson  of the same name were well known New  Yorkers ; Bernard, married Nancy Post.   (IV) \^■illiam Christopher, son of William  (2) and Mary (Robert) Rhinelander. was  born in New York in 1700, died in 1878. The  large estate which he inherited was greatly     3i8     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     increased by his skillful management and wis-  dom in making investments, his course being  to follow the family policy of holding and  improving city real estate. While the war of  1812 was going on he served as quartermaster  in Colonel Stevens' regiment, and was after-  wards lieutenant. When in New York he  resided at 14 Washington Square. He mar-  ried, in 1816, Mary, daughter of John and  Mary (Pixton) Rogers, and granddaughter of  John Rogers, who married Mary Davenport,  sister of Benjamin Franklin. Children: Alary  Rogers, married Lispenard Stewart ; Julia, re-  mained unmarried ; Serena, remained unmar-  ried ; William, mentioned below.   (V) William (3), only son of William  Christopher and Mary (Rogers) Rhinelander,  was born in New York, September 19, 1825.  He attended private schools, and afterwards  went to Columbia College, graduating from  that institution in 1845. He was long asso-  ciated with his father in the management of  the large vested interests of the family, and  after his father's death in 1876 he became the  trustee of the estate. He married, in 1853,  Matilda Cruger, daughter of Chief Justice  Thomas Jackson and Matilda ( Cruger)  Oakley. Judge Oakley was graduated from  Yale College, and in addition to holding  the position of chief justice of the superior  court of New York from 1850 until the date  of his death in 1858. had been a member of  congress in 1814-15, and again in 1828-29. He  was also elected attorney-general of the state  of New York in 1819, and was requested to  be a candidate for the presidency of the Unit-  ed States but declined. Judge Oakley's wife,  the mother of Mrs. William Rhinelander. was  the daughter of Henry Cruder, who was born  in New York in 173Q, died in 1827. Remov-  ing from New York to England he became  mayor of the city of Bristol in 1781. and was  twice a member of the British parliament for  that constituency, serving his terms between  1774 and 1784. During that time he had as  his colleague the celebrated Irish orator and  statesman, Edmund Burke, and with him op-  nosed the taxation of the American colonies.  Returning to New York in 1790. he became  a state senator in 1792. Henry Cruger was  the grandson of John Cruger, who came to  New York prior to 1700. and was a notable  merchant of New York and mayor of the city  from 1739 to 1744, marrying Maria, daughter     of Major Hendrick Cuyler, of Albany, who  served in the French and Indian war. The  children of William and Matilda Cruger (Oak-  ley) Rhinelander: i. Thomas Jackson Oak-  ley, born January 15, 1858; he was bred to  the law, graduating from Columbia College  in 1878, and from Columbia Law School in  1880; he made, however, no effort at prac-  ticing his profession, confining himself to the  care of the Rhinelander Estates and Real Es-  tate Company ; he is a member of the Union  Turf and Field. Metropolitan and Country  clubs, and the Columbia College .Mumni Asso-  ciation. He is or has been president of the  Delta Phi Club, vice-president of the Seventh  Regiment Veteran.

Foreign A\'ars. Colo-  nial Order and Huguenot Society of .Xmerica.  and the St. Nicholas societies. He married, in  1894. Edith Cruger, daughter of Charles Ed-  win and Letitia (Campbell) Sands, and has a  son, Philip Rhinelander. 2. Philip, mentioned  below.   (VT) Philip, junior son of William (3) and  Matilda Cruger (Oakley) Rhinelander. was  born October 8. 1865. in New York City. He  was graduated from Columbia College in 1882.  He studied law to enable him to safely man-  age his estate. He has traveled extensively,  and is a member of many corporation and  philanthropic boards. In company with his  elder brother, he purchased the ancient castle  of Schoenbersr-on-the-Rhine. near Oberwessel.  overlooking the old town, and in close vicinity  to the lands owned by their ancestors. This  castle is on the site of a Roman fortress built  by Julius Cajsar. It has suffered much from  the lapse of time and the wars of many cen-  turies, having been commenced as far back as  A. D. 951. Mr. Rhinelander is a member of  numerous clubs, including the L^nion, Down-  town. Calumet. l'>a(lminton. St. Elmo. Bal-  tusrol Ciolf and .\iuoniobile Club of .\merica.

New York City, and he maintains an  office on William street. He married. .Vpril  II. 1888. in New York Citv. Adelaide, born     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     319     November 9, 1866, in New York City, daugh-  ter of Isaac L. and Cornelia (Brady) Kip.     The name and family of Pot-  POTTER ter are supposed to be Norman   in origin. Ferguson says :  'It has been remarked that names derived from  trades are more common in France than England.  I should rather say it is the termination — er which  is more common, and that among the multitude of  names with this termination there are many which  accidentally coincide with names of trades. We  have in almost all cases, both in French and Eng-  lish, names which contain the roots and names  which form other compounds. Regarded from  this point of view French and English names mu-  tually throw great light on each other. When I  doubt whether Potter means a maker of pots it  very much strengthens my suspicion to find not  only a French Pottier, but also Potiere with a  corroborative termination.'   If the various families of Potter who settled  in this country were connected at all, it must  have been very remotely in their ancestry,  coming, as they did, from widely distant local-  ities. The census of 1774 shows in Rhode  Island Potters, five hundred and eight-nine  (probably many of these were slaves) in a  total population of -fifty-four thousand four  hundred and sixty.   ( I ) Robert Potter, the founder and immi-  grant ancestor of the Potter family in Amer-  ica here dealt with, came from Coventry, Eng-  land, in 1634. He was made a freeman of  the Massachusetts Plantation, September 3.  1634. He is mentioned first as being a farmer  at Lynn, Massachusetts, and as removing,  probably to Roxbury, soon after being made a  freeman of the colony. The records mention  his first trouble with his church at Roxbury,  which finally resulted in the necessity of his  leaving the colony, which he did, and settled  in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. At this time  Robert Potter had become a follower and  friend of Samuel Gorton, the ereat religious  di<:turber, and thev together with their asso-  ciates purchased the tract of land called the  fSbawomett Purchase, in Rhode Island, but  afterwards named by them 'Warwick.' in  honor of the Earl of Warwick, who had so  much befriended them in their troubles with  the Plantation of Massachusetts. In 1638 Rob-  ert Potter apneared asjain before the court  and was admitted an inhabitant of the island   kof Aquidneck, Rhode Island, the same year.  Gorton, Potter and iheir associates seem to     have been religious agitators. They agreed  with the sect of Quakers in the rejection of  church ordinances and in some few other  points ; they, however, differed from them in  many points deemed the most essential. From  the records it appears that they did not get  on very peaceably at Portsmouth. In the fol-  lowing proceedings of the colony of Rhode  Island, March 10, 1642, it was ordered that  'Robert Potter and Richard Garden, Randall  Houlden and Sampson Shotton be disfran-  chised of the privileges and prerogatives be-  longing to the body of this state and their  names canceled from the records.' On the  day following it was ordered by the colony  of Rhode Island: 'That if Robert Potter.  John Wickes. Randall Houlden, Richard Car-  den or Sampson .Shotton, shall come upon this  island armed, they shall be, by the constable  calling to himself sufficient aid, disarmed and  carried before the magistrate and there find  sureties for tlieir good behavior ; and further  be it established, and if that course shall not  regulate them or any of them, then a further  due and lawful course of law already begun  with John Wickes.' In 1642 Robert Potter  sold his house and land in Portsmouth to his  brother-in-law, John Anthony. In 1643 he,  with others of the Shawomett purchasers,  was notified to appear at the general court at  Boston to hear complaint of Pomham and Soc-  conocco as to 'some unjust and injurious deals  toward them by yourselves.' This summons  they declined to obey, so they were all carried  to Boston and sentenced to be confined in  dift'erent towns, their wives betakine them-  selves to the woods, suffering hardships that  resulted in the deaths of at least three of the  women, one of them being the wife of Robert  Potter. In the same vear Robert Potter was  also excommunicated from his church, as ap-  nears in the records of the First Church of  Roxbury by the Rev. John Eliot. There is  no record of the exact date of Robert Potter's  coming to this country on the ship in which  he was a passensrer. excepting that he was a  passenger with the Rev.

(II) John, son of Robert and Isabel Potter,-  was born at Portsmouth, Rhode Island, in  1639, died in 1694. He was enrolled a free-  man in 1660. February 6, 1660, he testified  that in his conscience that he did believe his  father sold a certain house, etc., in Portsmouth  to his uncle, Anthony, and engajjcd that when  he came of age he would confirm the sale. On  .August 24, 1676, he was a member of the  court martial held at Newport for the trial of  certain Indians charged with being implicated  in King Philip's designs. Three years later  he was grantcfl on his petition by the assembly  thirty-six shillings due him for service some  years since, being constable, in securing and  sending Indians to Newport. On June 15,  1687, the petition of Sarah Potter, of War-  wick, to court was deferred to justices of the  peace of Providence, Warwick and Rochester,  and three months later John deeded to his eld-  est son Robert two hundred acres for love,  etc. John Potter married (first) June 2, 1664,  Ruth, daughter of Edward and Judith Fisher;  (second) Sarah (Wright) Collins.

The  iury of inquest on his death judged him 'to  be axedentolly excesery to his own deatli oc-  casioned by the fall of a tree.' He married  Jane, daughter of Roger and Mary Burling-  ham. His widow married, December 27, 171 1,  his brother Edward, and it is a very singular  fact relating to these two brothers that thev  each had a son named John, who grew to  maturity having the same mother, namely,     Jane ( Burlingham) Potter.

He was first sent to the district schools  of his native hamlet, and was there favored  with the instruction of a Mr. Thompson, a  man capable of appreciating him. At the age  of twelve he entered the academy at Pough-  keepsie. and having secured a scholarship later  went to Union College. He was confirmed at  Christ church, Philadelphia, by the venerable  Bishop White, and began his theological  studies at the General Theological Seminary.  He was called to be a tutor at the Union  College at twenty and within a year was ad-  vanced to the professorship of mathematics.  He was made a priest by Bishop Bonnell, and  after a period as rector at Boston was made  Bishop of Pennsylvania. His biographer says  of him : 'He lived more in his three score  years than most of those who stretch to the  utmost limit of earthly continuance do in their  larger span.'

Alonzo and Sarah Maria  (Knott) Potter, was born Julv 16, 182Q, died  at Newport. Rhode Island. Februarv 19, 1887.  His military career began in New York City,  and he was intimately connected with the  Ninth Army Corps, whose chief was General  Ambrose E. Burnside, of Rhode Island, and  therefore it can be said as of Homer in ancient     days that three cities can claim the honor of  his well-earned fame. After his college course  at Union College, under the care of his grand-  father, young Potter established himself in  New York as a lawyer, and at the beginning  of the civil war was in successful practice  in New York City. After the war broke out,  having no immediate ties, his wife having died  in 1858, a year after their marriage, he de-  termined to go to the front, and immediately  prepared himself by study and drill to take the  position to which his ambition called him.   On the organization of the Fifty-first Regi-  ment in New York he received the commis-  sion of lieutenant-colonel. His superior was  Colonel Ferrero, and Charles W. Le Gendre  was major. The regiment was moved to An-  napolis and soon after was attached to Burn-  side's little army at Annapolis, and brigaded  under General Reno. They had their baptisms  of fire at Roanoke Island, where Potter led  three companies of his regiment to the assault  of the batteries and was the first to enter the  works. At Newbern the Fifty-first had again  the post of honor and stormed the entrench-  ments on the left of the rebel lines. Here  Major Le Gendre was shot through the mouth,  and Lieutenant-Colonel Potter received a ball  in the groin, which passed through his body,  and here Potter showed that cool courage in  which he was not excelled, not even by Grant.  He remained on the field, in spite of his  wound, until the close of the memorable day,  and his judgment in pointing the line of at-  tack decided the victory in favor of the Union  troops. From Newbern the Fifty-first was  moved to support General McClellan, and  soon after General Pope in what is known as  the second Bull Run campaign. Here they  held the left of the Federal lines, covering  Pope's retreat, and here again, at the critical  point of the day, the Union lines broken,  Reno's brigade was called to retrieve the dis-  aster, and Colonel Potter led the gallant Fifty-  first in full view of the remainder of the  army, and broke the rebel lines. At South  Mountain, where the lamented Reno fell, the  Fifty-first was again in the post of honor, and  at Antietam, Potter achieved for himself an  almost romantic fame. The Union troops were  disordered and the bridge over Antietam  Creek, the key to the Federal position, lay in  front of the enemy's line and under the full  fire of their artillery. Potter, seizing the flag     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     of his regiment, crossed the bridge, calling on  his men to follow him, and thus secured the  position, and in the words of McClellan at  the time, 'he saved the day.' Some day,  it has been said, this action will be as noted  in history as is the similar dash of Napoleon  over the bridge at Arcolo or over the bridge  at Lodi. At Antictam, again. Potter was  slightly wounded. The Fifty-first, of which,  after the promotion of Ferrero to be brigadier-  general. Potter had sole command, was sent  with General Burnside, his old commander and  life-long personal friend, to take part in the  western campaign ; Potter took a place on  Burnside's staff, and by General Grant's spe-  cial order received an independent command.  During the siege of Knoxville, Potter com-  manded the division in front of the lines, and  with a greatly inferior force so manoeuvred  for seven trying days as to check the advance  of General Longstreet (detached to the cap-  ture of the beleagured city from General  Hood's army) and to admit of the relief  and re-enforcement of that port. It will be  remembered that the final assaults of the rebels  were defeated on the entrenchments in an  almost hand-to-hand fight. Potter had now  reached his true position as a commander of  large bodies. In the Wilderness campaign he  was constantly under fire, and unusually active  in his division. Here Major Le Gendre, now  colonel of his old regiment, the Fifty-first, was  finally disabled, losing an eye. The assault,  after the explosion of the memorable mine at  Petersburg, fell to General Burnside's com-  mand. Unfortunately this officer (General  Burnside). of but too facile a nature, left to  lot the choice of the officer who should lead  the assault, and that fell to an incompetent  officer. General Grant in his memoir says:  'In fact. Potter and Wilcox were the only  division commanders General Burnside had  who w^ere equal to the occasion.' Neither of  them was chosen. The eventful history of  the mine explosion needs no further reference.  An intimate friend of General Potter states  that he had matured a plan for destroying the  bridge over the .\i>pnmattox, which would have  confined General Tree's armv and saved further  fighting. A touching incident is related by a  friend of General Potter. He had mounted  his horse in front of Fort Sedgwick, called  'Fort Hell' by his men, to lead his regiment  to battle, when he was struck by a ball and     wounded in the groin, as stated above. While  he lay desperately wounded on the field he was  visited by President Lincoln, who spoke ten-  derly to him, and cheered him with some of  his characteristic words. After the war he  was assigned by the secretary of state to the  command of Rhode Island and Connecticut  district of the military department of the East,  with headquarters in Newport, and in the  autumn of the same year he married his sec-  ond w'ife. A graceful compliment was paid  to Mrs. Potter, who was in receipt of a novel  but acceptable wedding present in the form of  a full major general's commission for her hus-  band, sent under the seal of the war depart-  ment of Secretary Stanton, the general's brevet  having already been received. In 1866 he was  appointed colonel of the Forty-first United  States Infantry (colored), but never assumed  command. This closed his brilliant military  career. General Hancock said of him that  he was one of the twelve best officers (West  Point graduates not excepted) in the army,  and with his well-known modesty he (General  Potter) was wont to say that he might have  made a first-rate officer with the advantages of  an early education at West Point.   After the gigantic failure of the .Atlantic  and Great Western Railroad Company he was  appointed receiver, a position of labor and  trust, and for three years he lived in a car on  the line of the railroad. Later, in the hope  of improving his somewhat shattered health,  he went to England, residing in W'arwick  county, following the hounds, and maintain-  ing by his generous hospitality the credit of  his native land and a true American gentle-  man. On his return he purchased 'The  Rocks,' which he made his residence, and  during the summer season he entertained in a  liberal manner. He spent his winters in Wash-  ington, making common household with his  brother. Congressman Potter. General Pot-  ter had a good deal to bear in his latter days  in the way of bodily pain, and not a little of  it may have been occasioned, it may be pre-  sumed, by the rigors of the civil war. endured  by him with immense patience and courage.  A memorial was erected to his memory at the  place of his burial, referring to his services  to his country, and testifying to the sincere  admiration in which he was held by his  countrymen.   He married (first) .\pril 14, 18,57, Frances     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     323     Tileston ; (second) Abby Austin Stevens,  daughter of John A. Stevens, a distinguished  financier, and president of the Bank of Com-  merce. Children; Robert Burnside, men-  tioned below; Warwick, born October 31,  1871, died October 11, 1893; Austin, born in  New York. January 16, 1873; Frances Tiles-  ton, married James L. Breese.   (IX) Robert Burnside, son of General Rob-  ert Brown and Abby Austin (Stevens) Pot-  ter, was born at New York, January 29, 1869.  He was educated at Groton School, Harvard,  and the Ecole des Beaux Arts, Paris. He is  by profession an architect and was a member  of the firm of Robertson & Potter, architects,  160 Fifth avenue. New York, from 1900 to  iQio. He was graduated from Harvard in  1891 with the degree of Bachelor of Arts, and  has a diploma as architect from the French  government. He is a member of the American  Institute of Architects and is well known in  his profession. Mr. Potter is a member of  several prominent clubs and societies, among  them the Knickerbocker Club, the Country  Club, the New York Yacht Club, the Architec-  tural League, The Society of Beaux Arts,  Architects, and the Societe des Architectes  Diplomes par le Gouvernement, Paris. His  permanent address is Antietam Farm, Smith-  town, New York.     This family surname is found  PYNE written both as Pyne and Pine,   Lower stating that its derivation  is from the proximity of the dwelling place of  the original family to a pine forest. The  American possessors of the name are said  to be a mixed Eng^lish, French. Spanish and  German descent. The immediate home of that  branch of the family that left England for  America was the county- of Devon in the south  of England. The eldest branch of the Pyne  family of Devonshire, which in 1797 assumed  the additional name of Coffin, is descended  directly in the male line from Oliver Pyne, of  Ham in Morwenstowe, who settled at East  Down in 1307. His grandfather, the second  son of John de Pyne, of Upton Pyne and Ham  in Morwenstowe, inherited Ham and other  manors about 1332, while the elder brother re-  ceived the main possessions of the family, in-  cluding Upton Pyne. This John de Pyne,  member of parliament in 1332, was a son of  Sir Herbert de Pyne, and was sixth in descent     from Sir Herbert de Pyne, who was lord of  the manor in 1122. This earlier Sir Herbert  was probably the grandson of the Seigneur de  Pins, one of the hundrci and eighteen knights  who fought at Hastings in 1066, and who may  or may not have been killed in that battle, as  nothing definite is known in regard to his  settling in England. It is thus possible that  his grand.son, Sir Herbert, was after all the  first of the family to make his home in the  conquered country, coming over with King  Henry I. in the year iioo. The ancestral home  of the family, the Shute House, still stands  in Devonshire, and the coat-of-arms, belong-  ing presumably to the first Anglo-Norman an-  cestor, was as follows ; Gules, a chevron  ermine between three pine cones, or.   Ancestors in a direct line were Colonel John  Pyn, M. P., of Curr Mallet, to whom refer-  ence is made by Disraeli in his life of Charles  I. ; James Pyne, who lived at Brook House,  Kent, as late as 1400; John de Pyne, M. P.,  1332; Sir Thomas de Pyne, 1314; Sir Robert  de Pyne, 1243 ; Sir Thomas de Pyne of Combe  Pyne and Shute, 1240, High Sheriff of Devon;  Sir Herbert de Pyne, 1225; Nicholas de Pyne,  1191, crusader under Richard Coeur do Lion;  Gilbert de Pyne, in command at the siege of  the castle of Brionne under the Duke of Nor-  mandy, 1090.   During the last century the family name was  borne in England by many persons of culture  and rare artistic and literary attainments.  James Baker Pyne, born in 1800, was a noted  landscape painter, traveling extensively  throughout the continent. William Henry, of  a previous generation, born in 1769, died in  1843, was also a noted painter, beside being an  author of considerable celebrity ; he was  known as 'Ephraim Hardcastle.' and became  connected with Ackerman, the publisher, to  several of whose publications he contributed  both drawings and writings. The famous Lon-  don publishing house of Rivington was  founded bv a connection of the Pyne family.  Charles Rivington, who was born in 1688. in  Derbyshire, England, bein? the son of Thurs-  ton Rivington. of that locality. This firm,  whose sisrn was the 'Bible and Crown,' pub-  lishing chicflv theological works, were the pub-  lishers also of Samuel Richardson's 'Pamela.'  After the death of the founder, the business  was conducted by his sons John and James,  and finally passed into the hands of the Messrs.     324     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Longman, in 1893, the style of the firm ap-  pearing as Rivington, Percival & Company.   James Rivington, born in 1724, died in 1803,  son and successor of the founder of the pub-  Hshing house, made a fortune in the business  wliich, however, he rapidly dissipated, and  coming to America he settled as a bookseller  in Philadelphia, in 1760. The following year  he opened a book store at the lower end of  Wall street. New York, and in 1762 com-  menced selling books in Boston. He failed, and  re-commenced in New York, where in April,  1773, he began the publication of Rivington s  New York Gazetteer, supporting the British  government. This brought him into trouble  with the colonists, who destroyed his printing  press and, melting the type, turned it into  bullets. Rivington returned to England and  procuring a new outfit was appointed king's  printer for New York, where he again set up  his presses and started Rivington' s Nezv York  Laval Gazette, 1777, which afterward became  the Royal Gazette; in this were published some  of Major Andre's verses. About the year 1781  he is said to have changed his politics, fur-  nishing General Washington with important  information; he remained in New York aftei  its evacuation by British troops, and changed  the title of his paper to Rivington' s Nezv York  Gazette and Universal Adviser. But his busi-  ness declined, his paper came to an end in  1783, and he passed the remainder of his life  in comparative obscurity. He died in New  York in January, 1803, his name being pre-  served in the annals of the city and applied  to one of its principal streets ; a portrait, which  has been engraved, is in possession of one of  the Appletons. James Rivington was twice  married and left children.   (I) Percy Rivington Pyne, namesake of  the publisher, and immigrant ancestor of the  Pyne family in America, was born in Eng-  land and came to this country in 1828. He  became prominent in public affairs and as a  philanthropist, and was president of the Na-  tional City Bank. He was also the head and  practicallv the creator of the Delaware. Lack-  awanna & Western railway. His wife was  Catherine S., daughter of Moses Taylor, one  of the foremost merchants and financiers of  the city in his day. Their son, Moses Taylor,  is mentioned below.   iW^ Moses Taylor, son of Percy Rivington  and Catherine S. (Taylor) Pyne, was born     in New York City, December 21, 1855. ^le  was educated at Princeton University, from  which he was graduated with the degree of  A. M. in 1877; and took a subsequent course  at the Columbia Law School, becoming a coun-  sellor at law in 1880. In 1903 he received  the degree of Litt. D. from Columbia Uni-  versity. He has large interests in railway and  industrial corporations, and is a director of  the National City Bank and other institutions.

He  received his preparatory education at St.  Paul's School, Concord, New Hampshire,  which is recognized as one of the foremost  schools of its kind in the country, and from  there he entered Princeton Ufniversity, from  which his father and several other ancestors  were graduated. Ho completed his course after  four years of scholastic and social prominence,  and was graduated Bachelor of Arts in the  class of 1903. In 1904 he began his financial  career in connection with the Farmers' Loan  (S: Trust Company, and in 1 007 he became  associated with the management of the Moses  Taylor estate. On February 8, Tqog, Mr.  Pyne organized the bankinsf and stock broker-  age firm of Pyne, Kendall & Hollister, with  offices in the new National Citv Bank build-  ing at No. 55 Wall St.. and he has since been  successfullv engaged in business in that con-  nection. He is a member of the board of  directors of the Commercial Trust Company  of New Jersey, the East River Gas Company,  the New Amsterdam Gas Company. Syracuse  Sc Bin?hamton Railroad.

This is a family that for seven hundred  years has been prominent in the public life  of England and America, producing men of  marked ability and distinction. Crusaders,  knights, judges, naval and military heroes,  civic officers, diplomats, governors, senators  and congressmen have brought their honors  to the family name through the long centuries.  The name is derived from two Saxon words,  'stoc,' a tree trunk, and 'tun,' an inclosure,  indicative of the original locality of the fam-  ily in feudal times, which was a forest in-  closure. The earliest ancestors were lords of  the manor of Stockton, which they held under  the barony of Malpas. Stockton manor is in  the town of Malpas. Cheshire countv, Eng-  land, and it is known that David de Stockton  inherited it from his father in the year 1250.  One of his descendants. Sir Richard Stockton,  was knighted on the field by King Edward IV. ;  his son, John Stockton, was lord mayor of     London in 1470 and 1471 ; and a Sir Edward  Stockton was vicar of the church at Cookham  in Berkshire, and a leader during one of the  early expeditions to the Holy Land. John  Stockton, Esq., was a gentleman of note, who  died in 1700, as was also one Owen Stockton,  who died in 1610.   The arms of the family are : Gules. A chev-  ron vaire, argent and azure, between three  mullets, or. Crest: A lion rampant, support-  ing an Ionic pillar. Motto: Omnia Deo Pen-  dent : All depends on God. These arms were  engraved on the silver brought over to Amer-  ica by the immigrant ancestors in the old colo-  nial days.   The first person of the name of Stockton  who came to this country was the Rev. Jonas  Stockton, M. A., who with his son, Timothy,  then aged fourteen years, came to Virginia in  the ship 'Bona Nova,' in 1620. He was for  many years incumbent of the parishes of Eliz-  abeth City and Bermuda Hundred, and be-  came the progenitor of numerous descendants,  many of whom have become distinguished.  The next Stockton to emigrate from England  was, according to Hotten's 'Lists,' Thomas  Stockton, aged twenty-one, who sailed from  London for Boston in the ship 'True Love,'  September 16, 1635. Of him nothing more  is known. Finally came Richard Stockton, the  founder of the New Jersey family. The de-  scendants of the original stock have spread  throughout the entire country, from the Great  Lakes to the gulf and from sea to sea, and in-  clude eminent men in all the walks of life.  There are at this time in the United States  twenty-one towns of the name of Stockton,  from those in Maine and Massachusetts to the  larsrest of all. in California, which was named  in honor of the commodore.   (T) Richard Stockton, immigrant ancestor  of this family in .America, is found in Charles-  town, Massachusetts, as early as 1639, where'  he is witness to a deed. The next reference  to him is among the original patentees named  in the charter of the town of Flushing, Long  Island, where he appears to have been a prom-  inent man and is rated among the well-to-do  citizens of the place. He was commissioned  lieutenant of horse of Flushing. Anril 22,  1665. and declined, with the consent of Gover-  nor Nicholls. an election to the same position  in the foot guards He took a prominent part  in the controversies between the town and     326     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Governor Peter Stuyvesant on religious mat-  ters, and became converted to the tenets of  the Society of Friends, after which he removed  to Springfield township, Burlington county,  New Jersey. Here he purchased about two  thousand acres of land, on January 30, 1690,  from George Hutchinson, and resided on this  estate, known as Annanicken, until his death  at an advanced age in September, 1707. His  wife, Abigail, survived him, and was living at  late as April 14, 17 14. when she conveyed some  property to her sons. Children : Richard,  mentioned below; John, born in 1674; Job,  Abigail, Mary. Sarah, Hannah, Elizabeth, born  1680.

In August, 1696, he purchased from  Dr. John Gordon a tract of four hundred acres  of land on the north side of Stony Brook,  which includes all of what is now the campus  of Princeton University and the grounds of  the Theological Seminary. In T701 he pur-  chased from William Penn for the sum of nine  hundred pounds an estate of about six thou-  sand acres on Stony Brook, of which the pres-  ent city of Princeton is nearly the center. A  portion of his estate. Mnrven. built bv him in  T/Oi. has remained in the family to the pres-  ent day and is now the residence of his de-  scendant, Mr. Bayard Stockton. By reason of  his laree possessions and his unblemished  character, Richard Stockton held an impor-  tant place among the earlv settlers. On No-  vember 8, T6f)T. he married at the Chesterfield  Friends' monthly meetine. Susanna, daughter  of Robert and Ann Witham, and widow of  Thoma': Rnbinson. She was born November  29, 1668. di^d in April, T749. having survived  her second husband and married again to  Judp^e Thomas Leonard, of Princeton. Rich-  ard Stockton died in Julv. 1700.

The name has been variously  LUMMIS spelled Lummis, Lumas,  Lumus, Lomas, Loomes,  Loomis, Lummas and Lumis, by different  branches of this one family and throughout  the changes wrought by centuries. Its original  derivation is from the Welsh, 'lom,' meaning  bare, naked or exposed, and 'niaes,' a field,  therefore the significance is 'the place in the  open field.' The arms of the Lummis family,  as used by them in this country: Argent be-  tween two jjalets gules, three fleurs de lis  in pale sable, a chief azure. Crest : On a  chapeau a pelican vulning herself proper. Mot-  to : Ne cede inalis.   (I) Edward Lummis was the progenitor of  the family in America. He emigrated to this  country in 1635. Curiously there are two  entries in the records of his arrival, both bear-  ine date of the same year. 1635. In the 'Suzan  and Ellin.' 1635. came Edward Lumus. aged  twenty-four years, and in the 'Elizabeth.'  April 17, 1635. imbarqued for New England.  came Edward Loomes. aged twenty-seven.  Both ships sailed from the port of London.  England.   Edward Lummis made his home in Ins-  wich, Massachusetts, where he was soon called  into active military service in defending the  colony aeainst the Indian attacks. In 1637, the  Indian'; being frcatly feared by the colonists,  the military officers were ordered to maintain  watch and ward every dav, to cause all men to  bring their arms to the meeting-house, and     to see that no person traveled above a mile  from his dwelling, except where houses were  near together, without bearing some arms. At  last the summons to arms came in the war  against the Pequods. and in April, 1637, seven-  teen young men marched away, over the road  to Salem, to join the little army of valiant  fighters. Six more followed in May. Among  them was Edward Lumas. Upon the road they  engaged with some of the Pequods, and  pursued them until their ammunition gave out,  when they used their muskets as clubs. Two  of the Indians were killed and two of the party  of colonists were wounded. In 1041 Edward  Lumas appears in the town records of Ipswich  as a commoner. Under date of December 29,  1648, is recorded a list of those who subscribed  their names to allow Major Daniel Denison the  sum of £124-7 yearly so long as he shall be  their leader to encourage him in his military  helpfulness. Edward Lummis appears on the  list as a subscriber. On February 7, 1653,  Edward Lummis made his mark as a witness  to the will of Mark Quilter, of Ipswich. In  March, 1659, Edward Lomase brought a suit  against Cajitain William Traske for taking  possession of and selling twenty acres of land  beloneing to nlaintifF, which suit was later  withdrawn. Edward Lomas appears as a mem-  ber of the grand jury at the court held at Ips-  wich. .Sentember 2=;. 1660.   In 1661 Edward Lomas served as the con-  stable of Ipswich, and the same year he was  given liberty to fell two white oak trees. He  also served as constable there in the succeeding  year. In 1664 he owned a share and a half in  Plum island. On March 22. 1660. Edward  Lummas, aeed about fifty-eisrht years, deposed  that Goodman Wood, the baker, came to him  and asked whether he had seen a heifer, and  he replied: 'I wi'l tell you how you may  know her by this: If yon com neare and hold  out ynur hand to her, the heifer will com to  vou. for I used to pive her Bis Cake,' which  deponent did, and she came to him. When  caid Wood took the heifer, he told dopenent  that if anybody had a better c'aim. he would  pive her up. Sworn in court. This deposition  was made in connection with the case of  Obadiah Wood vs. Richard Kimball for tres-  pa«<;. taking a heifer out of his vard and de-  taining her. On February tt. 1667. Edward  Inma';. bavin' been a soldier against the  Pequod Indians, and not having any land     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     329     granted to him, as others had benefited, the  town now granted him six acres of land. On  March 2, 1667, Edward Chapman sold to Ed-  ward Lummus 'my dwelling-house wherein  said Lummus dwells, with barn and one and  one-quarter acres the street called Mill st.  towards southwest, and the house and land of  widow Stacy southeast.' February 13, 1678,  on a list of the names of those persons who  had the right of commonage according to law  and order of the town appears Edward Lomas.  On the list of those who by law were allowed  to have their votes in town affairs voted to  be recorded at the town meeting, December 2,  1679, appears the name of Edward Lomas.  Edward Lummus was a weaver by trade, and  lived on the corner of Baker's Lane and  Scott's Lane, Ipswich. Massachusetts. He had  a wife, Mary, who made a deposition in 1672,  in which she states her age to be about sixty-  six years. On May 25, 1682, Edward Lum-  mis conveyed to his son, Jonathan, his home-  stead, house, barn and an acre of land, to-  gether with twelve acres purchased of Mr.  Cogswell, then deceased. His will stated that  the twelve acres were on the opposite side of  the street from his house. Besides the afore-  mentioned land, the town records of Ipswich  show that on February 27, 1648, Edward  Lummis was granted thirty acres of upland,  and in 1649 five acres of meadow.   Edward Lummis died August 29. 1682, and  his will was probated September 26, 1682. His  son, Jonathan, was charged 'for recording  your father's will and inventory 6 shillings.'  Children of Edward and Mary Lummis were:  I. Jonathan, resided in Ipswich, Massachu-  setts. 2. Edward, settled in New Jersey. 3.  Samuel, see forward. 4. Nathaniel, removed  to Dover.   (II) Samuel, son of Edward and Mar)^  Lummis, was born at Ipswich, Massachusetts,  June 7, 1639, died February 24, 1720. He  testified in court on April 2. i6s7. that he saw  Edmond Bridges 'in sermon time get a piece  of paper of Daniel Warner, Jr., and write on  it, and over his shoulder read these words :  'Goodman Tode, I would entreate you,' and he  gave it to Tod after the lecture, and said his  father sent it. His father denied it later in  the shop.' This testimonv was given in con-  nection with the case of Edmond Bridges, who  was fined for writing a note in Rowley meet-  ing-house in lecture time to John Tod, for five     shillings, in his father's name. In March, 1661,  Samuel Lumas appeared as a witness in the  case of John Godfry vs. Edward Clarke for a  debt. In 1678 Samuel Lumas appears on a list  of inhabitants of Ipswich. On December 19,  1684, he sold to his neighbor, Joseph Quilter,  one acre adjoining Jonathan Lummus' land in  Ipswich. Samuel Lummis lived at the Ham-  let, now Hamilton, Massachusetts. He was  buried there in the ancient graveyard of that  place and the inscription upon his tombstone  reads :   Here lyeth the Body of  Mr. Samuel Lummus who   was Born June ye 7th.   1639 & Died ye 24th. Feby   1720 asred 80   years.   Samuel Lummis married (first), November  18, 1664, Sarah Smith, by whom he had three  children. Between the years 1676 and 1679 he  married (second) Hannah White. She was  the daughter of John White, and was born in  Wenham, Massachusetts. She had previously  married, January 23, 1663, Ensign John Divoll,  who lived at Lancaster, and was killed by the  Indians, February 10, 1675-76, while in charge  of the Rowlandson garrison house. She and  her children were taken prisoners by the In-  dians, but were ransomed on May 12, 1676,  and she died before July 12, 1717. Children  of Samuel Lummis: i. Edward, see forward.  2. Samuel, born February 14. 1667. 3. Mary,  born January 10, 1669.   (Ill) Edward (2), son of Samuel and  Sarah (Smith) Lummis, was born in Ipswich,  Massachusetts, October 12, 1665. died Febru-  ary, 1740. About the year 1697 he removed  from Massachusetts to Cohansey, Salem coun-  ty. New Jersey, as shown by the following  abstract of a deed: On May 3, 1697. John  Bellowes, of London, merchant, by his attor-  ney. Thomas Budd, of Philadelphia, merchant,  deeded to Thomas Jones, Jonathan Moore-  house, Joseph Seelcye and Joseph Sayrc, late  of New Eng-land, now of Ccsariae River, alias  Cohansev, New Jersey, planters, four hundred  acres to be surveyed on said river. The gran-  tees in this deed allotted the said land among  themselves 'ye first Twelve .\dventurcrs,yet  settled on ve place,' Thomas Jones except, and  John Bennett, Thomas Bennett Jr.. John Bate-  man, Nicholas Johnson, John Mills, Joseph  Grimes, Edward Lumis, Joseph Smith. John  Smith, John Ogden, Joseph Wheeler and     330     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     others. The provincial law enacted at Bur-  lington in May, 1697, enacts 'that the tract of  land in Cohansey purchased by several people  lately inhabitants of Fairfield in New England  be from and after the date hereof erected into  a township and be called Fairfield.' This law  would indicate that Edward Lummis may have  been an inhabitant of Fairfield, Connecticut,  before going to Cohansey, New Jersey.   On June 10, 1697, in an agreement between  the 'purchasers in Fairfield,' Edward Lumis  was assigned one hundred acres and Daniel  Westcott or Waistcoat one hundred and fifty  acres, they agreeing with others to give secur-  ity for nine pounds English per one hundred  acres. This land was evidently part of the  tract of land deeded the same day, June 10,  1697. to the planters, an abstract of which  deed is as follows : 'Thomas Bridge, of Ces-  ariae River, New Jersey, gentlemati, deeds  1. 000 acres in Fairefcild in Cesariae River on  the east side of Cohansey River and north side  of Saw Mill Creek, to the above-mentioned  planters of Fairfield, among whom are Edward  Lumis and Daniel Westcott.'   He was a member of the grand jury of  Salem county, New Jersey, December 15,  1708; December 26, 1710, and June 26, 171 1.  He was appointed constable on April 12, 1709,  for the south side of Cohansey, and was com-  missioner of roads, November 27, 1722, or  surveyor of highways. His will was dated  October 28. 1738; was proved May 5, 1740,  and calls him as of Cohansey, yeoman. It  mentions his wife, Abigail, and the following  children : Edward, Abigail, Samuel, Sarah,  Daniel, see forward ; Mary, Tamson, Lydia,  Elizabeth. Some time before November 3,  1702, he married Abigail, daughter of Daniel  and .Abigail Westcott, or Waistcoat.   CIV) Daniel, son of Edward (2) and Abi-  gail f Westcott) Eummis, was a yeoman of  Cumberland county. New Jersey. His will  bears the date June i. 1764. His wife was  named Tudith, and they hadthe following chil-  dren : Jonatha!!, Daniel. Sarah, Tamson, Ebe-  nezer, see forward : Joseph. Catherine, Han-  nah.   (V) Ebenezer. son of Daniel and Tudith  I.ummis, was born in May. 1748. died Novem-  ber 28, t8oi. He married C first! .Susannah   . l)orn February 26. 1753, died December   27. T700: ( second '> Lvdia . wl>o was   mentioned in his will, which was dated Octo-     ber 14, 1801, wherein he was described as of  the township of Deerfield, Cumberland coun-  ty, New Jersey. He had the following chil-  dren: William Nixon, see forward; John,  Ebenezer, Daton or Dayton, Susaimah, Sarah.   (VI) Dr. William Nixon Lummis, son of  Ebenezer and Susannah Lummis, was born in  Woodbury, New Jersey, April 15, 1775, died  April 16, 1833, at Sodus, Wayne county. New  York. He studied medicine in Philadelphia  under the famous physician. Dr. Benjamin  Rush, who later became his intimate friend.  In tlie early part of 1800 Dr. Lummis left  Philadelphia asd explored the Genesee val-  ley of New York state, finally making his home  in Sodus, Wayne county. New York, where he  resided for the remainder of his life. He held  many town offices, and was a most active  citizen. From the records of the town of  Sodus one learns of his various activities. In  181 3 the town by vote complied with certain  provisions of a new school law. Inspectors  were appointed, and it was voted to raise by  tax a sum twice the amount apportioned by  the state. John Holcomb, Byram C.reen and  W'illiam Wickham were elected the first school  commissioners, and the inspectors were Enoch  Moore, Thaddeus Bancroft. William N. Lum-  mis, William Danforth. Daniel Arms and  Peter Failing.   At a special meeting held at the house of  Daniel Arms, in Sodus, September i. 1814. the  following were chosen: Ephraim Coon, Esq.,  to preside: John Fellows and William N.  Lummis. clerks. The war of 1812 was being  fought at the time, and among the resolutions  adopted was the following:   'Rpsolved. That William N. Lummi?. William  Wickliam. John Fellows. Thomas Wafer and .\sher  Doolittle he a Committee of Safety for the town of  Sodus. Resolved, That a notice signed by a ma-  jority of the Committee, giving notice of the an-  proairh of the enemv. he deemed sufficient to justify  .said official act. Resolved, That the Committee of  Safety offer a subscription paper to the good people  of the town of Sodus for the purpose of obtaining  funds for the defense of said town, and that such  subscrintion shall be demanded onlv in case of the  enemv's obtaining command of Lake Ontario. '   Upon the records of Dwight Post, Grand  .'\rmy of the Republic, made for the purpose  of decoration, we find the name of William  N. Lummis as a .soldier of the war of t8i2.  When the British made their attack upon  Sodtis, his house was one of those destroyed  by fire. When he died there, .April 16, 1833,     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     331     his remains were interred at that place, but  in May, 1910^ they were removed, with those  of his two infant sons, to the cemetery at  Rose, Wayne county. New York, at the in-  stance of his grandson, Benjamin R. Lummis,  of New York City. In the local newspaper,  The Herald, at the time of the removal of  these remains, it is stated of Dr. William N.  Lummis that 'he took up one thousand acres  of land on both sides of Sodus Bay, intending  to establish an old English tenantry farm. On  his estate he organized the first postoffice at  Lumisville, and was appointed its first post-  master.'   The military history of William N. Lummis  is as follows : In order to enable the inhabi-  tants in the exposed frontier places, like the  little village of Sodus, in the Oswego Military  District on Lake Ontario, to defend them-  selves.

On the evening of June 15. 1813, the British  squadron on Lake Ontario, under Commodore  Sir Tames Lucas Yeo, arrived off the Genesee  river, and sent an armed detachment to the  villaee of Charlotte, at the head of navigation  on that river, whence it carried off a large  quantity of stores. The next day the squad-  ron started eastward, evidentlv intent on fur-  ther incursions, and appeared off Sodus Bay.  on Fridav. July 18. 1813. Brigadier-General  William Burnet, commanding the district, hav-  ing on the evening of the 15th received infor-  mation that the British had landed at Genesee  river, ordered into service the Seventv-first  Reeiment New York State Militia Infantrv,  under Lieuteanant-Colonel Commandant Phil-  etus Swift, and part of the Militia Rifle Bat-  talion in the county, under Commandant Elihu  Raneer, but they did not arrive until a little  after sunrise on Monday morning, June 21.

Captain Turner,  while living in Herkimer county, had been  from June 13, 1805, until his removal to Lyons,  May 23, 1812, a captain in the Second Bat-  talion, Sixth Regiment New York State Artil-  lery, and was an officer of experience. On  notification of the arrival of the British squad-  ron luider Sir James Yeo, and under Brig-  adier-General Burnet's orders. Captain Turner  at once took command of the Independent  Sodus Company. This company, including  William N. Lummis, took post at a bridge  over a ravine, to resist the advance of the  British. Here a sharp fi.ght ensued, in which  seven of the enemy were killed, while in the  Independent Company one man was mortally  wounded and three others wounded. So firm  was the resistance that the British detachment  was repulsed and fell back to the boats, but in  doing so. out of revenge, on Sunday morning,  burned the empty public storehouse, five dwell-  ings, including that of Mr. Lummis, and the  old Williamson Hotel. Soon afterward they  embarked, taking along with them about two  hundred and thirty barrels of flour and a few  barrels of whiskey and pork, private prop-  erty. On Monday morning the Seventy-first  Regiment State Militia arrived, and the serv-  ices of the Independent Company of Citizens  under Captain Turner were no longer needed,  so thev were released from further duty. Their  service, was from June 17 to June 20, 1813.   After he had completed his collegiate edu-  cation, he studied medicine, attendine the lec-  tures of Dr. Rush at Philadelphia. His ambi-  tion as a student is indicated by the fact that  he took coupious notes of the whole course,  which filled several quarto volumes, and are  the only report extant of that course. An  acquaintance thus formed between master and  pupil, they afterwards maintained a corre-  spondence of intimacy and friendship. Com-  mencing the practice of medicine in Philadel-  phia, he continued there until declining health,  consequent upon an attack of yellow fever, in-  duced him to seek a change of climate. He  went on a tour of exploration to the Genesee  country soon after 1800. In a trip by water  with some friends, thev were overtaken bv a  storm oft' the mouth of the Genesee river. The  party landed, and went up to view the falls.  upon the site of Rochester they came to a sol-  itary log cabin, knocked, and were bid to     33^     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     enter. Upon entrance they found that in the  absence of the family a parrot had been the  hospitable representative. The family re-  turned shortly, and gave them a supper of  potatoes and milk, the best that residents of  a place now the site of an important city  were accustomed to in those days. Deciding  to make Sodus Point his home, he made con-  siderable investments in lands there, and soon  removed his family to their new home. He  resided at the Point until the commencement  of the war of 1812, when he removed two  miles farther up the lake, where he purchased  lands and erected a flouring mill. Later he  added a sawmill, an iron forge and several  other branches of business, besides improving  the land by dividing it into farms and build-  ing houses thereon for the tenants. The lit-  tle settlement was named 'Maxwell,' after his  wife, Sarah (Maxwell) Lummis, niece of Gen-  eral \Villiam Maxwll. who was on General  Washington's staff. His medical practice was  only such as the exigencies of the new region  demanded, and was in large measure grat-  uitous. He bestowed much of his time and  talents to the cause of internal improvements.  If not the projector, he early and zealously  espoused the opening of a communication be-  tween Lake Ontario and the Erie canal, by  means of a branch terminating at Sodus Bay.  This branch was ordered dug by Mr. Lummis  and General Adams and exists today and is  called bv politicians, 'The .\dams ditch.' It  is the shortest route from the Great Lakes to  the sea. To indefatigable industry and perse-  verance he added extraordinary business tal-  ents, and to a vigorous intellect he added a  thorough education, while he delighted in cul-  tivating literary tastes and pursuits in hours of  relaxation, all of which made him an agree-  able and instructive companion. The inscrip-  tion upon his tombstone at Sodus villaere pays  the foUowine tribute to his memory: 'He was  one of the pioneer border settlers. His enter-  prising, vigorous and active mind aided essen-  tially in the improvements of this country and  commanded for him universal esteem.'   William Nixon Lummis married twice. His  first wife died in earlv years. His second wife  was Sarah Maxwell, born .September 17. 1780,  died November 8, 1840, daughter of Cantain  John Maxwell and Marv .'\nn ( Clifford') 'Max-  well.

Elizabeth Friez, born October, 1815, died June  3, 1877; married Dr. William H.

Captain John Maxwell was born in county  Tyrone, Ireland, November 25, 1739. He set-  tled with his parents in Greenwich township,  now in Warren county. New Jersey. His par-  ents were John Maxwell, born in 1701, died  August 19, 1786, and Ann, his wife, born in  1712. died May 15, 1790. They emigrated to  America about 1747, and were buried in the  cemetery adjoining the First Presbyterian  Church of Greenwich. Captain John Maxwell  married (first) Elizabeth Sloan, of Laming-  ton. New Jersey, born in 1747. died May 30,  1768; he married (second) Mary Ann Clif-  ford, born in 1744, died June 9. 1804. by  whom nine children: he married (third'l Eliz-  abeth Kirkpatrick Sloan, daughter of David  Kirkpatrick, of Bernards township, Somerset  county. New Jersev, (being then widow of  Henrv Sloan, son of William and Mary Sloan,  of Lamington, New Jersey'), and who was  born in 1749, died June 9, 1829.   Upon the outbreak of the revolution, John  Maxwell enlisted and was made lieutenant of  the first company raised in Sussex county.  New Jersev. being subsequently promoted to  captain, and was attached to the Second Reg-  iment Hunterdon County Militia. He was  also captain in Colonel Spencer's additional  regiment, continental line, from February 7,  1777. to April II. 1778. when he resiened. He  later raised a companv of one hundred vol-  unteers from Sussex and Hunterdon counties,  and tendered their service to General Wash-  ington when he was much reduced in force.  This command was known as 'Maxwell.'s  Company,' and their addition to the ranks  was verv acceptable. He participated in the  battles of Trenton. Assunpink, Princeton,  Brandywine. Germantown. Monmouth and  Springfield. After the close of the war he     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     333     returned to his farm and was appointed one of  the judges of Hunterdon county, February 23,  1795; re-appointed November 30, 1800. He  removed to Flcmington about this time, and  resided there until his death, February 15,  1828. He was buried at the old stone church,  Greenwich township, and his tombstone reads :  'John Maxwell, Esq., second son of John and  Anna Maxwell. He was born in the county of  Tyrone in Ireland, Nov. 25th, A. D. 1739, and at  an early age emigrated with his father to \ew Jer-  sey. He was Lieutenant in the lirst Company  raised in Sussex county for the defence of his  adopted country in the Revolutionary War ; and  soon after in the darkest hour of her fortunes  joined the Army of General Washington as Cap-  tain of a company of 100 volunteers. He was en-  gaged in the battles of Trenton, Princeton. Brandy-  wine, Germantown, Monmouth and Springfield, and  ever distinguished as a brave and able officer ; hav-  ing served his country in various Military and Civil  offices and faithfully discharged his various duties  as a Soldier, a Citizen, a Christian, he closed a long  and useful life at his residence At Flemington,  February i=;th, A. D., 1828. in the Eighty-ninth year  of his age.'   (VH) William Maxwell, son of Dr. Will-  iam Nixon and Sarah (Maxwell) Lummis,  was born at Sodus, Wayne county. New York,  in 1809. died at Sodus Point, August 21, 1869,  buried in Greenwood cemetery. Brooklyn, New  York. He was educated at Hobart College.  Geneva, New York, and afterwards became a  dry goods merchant, importing Scotch cloths  and velvets. At the time when it often took  three months to cross the ocean, he made  yearly trips to Eunjpe in the interest of his  business, and thtis early succeeded as an enter-  prisins: merchant in his line. He removed to  New York in order to broaden his field. Be-  sides his business ability, Mr. Lummis was of  an artistic temper? ment and was capable of  drawing beautifully with pen and ink. He  was a dignified gentleman of the highest busi-  ness principles, and was regarded as a well-  read man of his day. Because of the condi-  tion of his health, which had become somewhat  impaired, he retired to his estate at Sodus  Point, New York, and there superintended the  operating of a sawmill, which cut the timber  from his own woods. He held the position  of postmaster of Lummisville, a town on the  opposite side of Sodus Bay from the Point,  which was settled by his father and named by  him.   William M. Lummis married, in New York  City, June 15, 1840, Ann, daughter of Will-     iam and Eliza ( West) O'Brien. She was born  October 6, 1816, died at New York City,  March 6, 1904. The children of William  Maxwell and Ann (O'Brien) Lummis were;  I. William, born May 2, 1841 ; married Eliz-  abeth Vesey Coleman. 2. John Maxwell, died  at Sodus Point, August 7, 1911 ; married Eliz-  abeth Beck, widow, deceased. 3. Mary Flor-  ence, unmarried. 4. Charles Augustus, mar-  ried Marion Duhain. 5. Dayton, died when  about five years of age. 6. Eliza O'Brien,  born April 13, 1855, unmarried. 7. Benjamin  Rush, see forward.   William O'Brien was born in Ireland in  1768, where he was Lord O'Brien, Earl of  Inchiquinn, and emigrated to America at the  time of the Irish rebellion in 1798. His title  and estate were confiscated by the English and  turned over to the Protestant branch, who  were loyal to England. He came over on a  ship commanded by Captain John Stevens,  whose half-sister, Eliza West, he afterwards  married. This marriage took place at the  house of the bride, and Father Fenwick of St.  Peter's Church in New York City officiated.  The records of this church show this marriage  apparently under two dates with different wit-  nesses, the first on January 27, 1810, with  'John Chambery, J. B. Dumoutet. Jas. Turk  & others' as witnesses ; the second on Febru-  ary 15, 1810, with 'Mrs. West, Mr. Crofts,  Mullany & others' for witnesses. Eliza West,  at the time of her marriage in 18 10. was a  school girl, fifteen years of age, while William  O'Brien was then forty-two years old. In  spite of the difference in their ages, there is  evidence that they lived a very happy life, she  surviving her husband many years, but never  remarrying.   Joseph A. Scoville. otherwise known as  Walter Barret, in 1870. had this to say of  W'illiam O'Brien :   'There was to be found in this great city, thirty  years and odd ago. experienced merchants who have  retired from active mercantile business and en-  gaged in pursuits equally imoortant. I have in my  eve now the very form and figure of one of these —  William O'Brien, who was engaged in the ship-  broker business, or rather in adjusting the claims of  merchants or other insurers, upon insurance com-  panies. In the days I .speak of, Mr. O'Brien was  the only person in the citv vi'ho did that particular  but important 'specialtie.' He made up 'general  averages' for ships and cargoes lost, and such was  the confidence in his capacity, integrity and cor-  rectness that his adju.stments were never disputed     334     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     by port-wardens, insurers or insurance companies.  He was a true Irish gentleman, and possessed great  conversational powers. His office was in Wall  street, between what are now Hanover and Pearl  streets. His residence was in Broome street,  around the corner from Broadway towards Crosby.  He was very jovial and social, and held his levees  regularly once or twice a week. His house was  always open to his friends. No Irish gentleman of  any note ever passed through New York without  making his appearance at the residence of Mr. O'-  Brien in Broome street. The best wines and liquors  in the United States could be found in perfection  upon Mr. O'Brien's good old-fashioned, mahogany  sideboard. No man died more regretted. He left  several children. Two of his sons, William and  John O'Brien, were for many years engaged in the  Mechanics' Bank, one as the bookkeeper and one as  first teller. They left the bank to found the house  of W. & J. O'Brien some years ago, and are now  doing a very extensive brokerage business in Wall  street. In fact, the O'Briens are probably as much  respected and do as large a business as any finan-  cial house in Wall street.'   His last place of business, 1S47, '^^'^^ ^o. 33  W'all street. He died at his residence, No. 433  Broome street. New York City, on Monday,  August 31, 1S46, aged seventy-eight years, and  was buried in the old St. Patrick's cemetery  at Mott and Prince streets, but his remains  were subsequently removed to Calvary ceme-  tery in Brooklyn.   fVni) Benjamin Rush, son of William  Maxwell and Ann (O'Brien) Lummis, was  born in New York City, July 27, 1857. He  was educated at St. Francis Xavier's College  in New York and at Seton Hall College in  South Orange, New Jersey. He engaged in  the real estate business, associating with it in-  surance brokerage, and in 1913 was located  at No. 25 West Thirty-third street. He is a  member of the appraisal committee of the  Real Estate Board of Brokers. The genial  disposition of Mr. I.ummis has won for him  a wide circle of acquaintances, while his tac-  tics and honesty of purpose in all business  transactions have placed him high in the ranks  of his associates. Among the patriotic socie-  ties he is very active, and his services are con-  stantly in demand in promoting their welfare.  He was appointed on the board of managers  of the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum by  His Eminence. Cardinal Farley.   Mr. Lummis is identified with the following  societies and institutions: Sons of the Revo-  lution in the State of New York and member  of its board of managers: Society of Colonial  Wars ; Veteran Corps of Artillery in the State     of New York ; War of 1812, uniformed corps;  National Museum of Art; Economic Society;  Museum of Natural History; National Geo-  graphic Society; Pilgrim Society; New York  Athletic Club; Circle of Friends of the Me-  dallion ; Advisorj' Board of the New York  Foundling Hospital; Advisory Board of tlu-  Seton Hospital for Consumptives; Board of  Trustees of the Catholic Institute for the  Blind.     This family is of ancient Scot-  AIOFFAT tish ancestry, dating back to   the early part of the thirteenth  century. Burke in his 'Encyclopedia of Her-  aldry,' published in 1S44, has mention of a  Nicholas de Moffat, Bishop of Glasgow, as  early as 1268. From the twelfth to the close  of the sixteenth century they were prominent  in the south of Scotland. They served in  the army of Wallace, and after his death  loyally gave their support to Bruce. In the  fifteeiUli century many interesting accounts  are preserved of the contests of the Moffats  with the Johnstone family, whose growing  power they bitterly opposed. About 1560 the  head of the Moffat clan was killed, and the  power of the family crushed. Soon after 1608  members of the family settled in Glencairn,  Lauderdale, England, the north of Ireland,  and on the continent. The family name is  derived from a locality in Annandale. Scot-  land. In this town is a plain called by the  ancient Celts Morfad or Maharfad, signifying  a long plain. Later, when the country was  occupied by the Normans, the pronunciation  of the old name iMaharfad was softened to  Moffat. A stream in the valley is called  Moffat or Moffat Water, and the valley  through which the stream flows is called  Moffat Dale. The old town on tlie northern  side of the plain was called Moffat, and the  medicinal springs near the town are known as  Moffat W'ells.   (I) The family were prominent Covenant-  ers, and Saiuuel Moffat, ancestor of a branch  of the family in Ireland, was born near Ayr-  shire. Scotland. He served with the Cove-  nanter forces in the battle of Bothwell Bridge,  June 22, 1679. and after their disastrous de-  feat fled to Ballylig. Ireland. A Samuel  Moffat was a resident of \\'oodbridge. New  Jersey, where in 1710 he became a member  of the Presbyterian church, and it is believed     SOUTHERN   that he was the Samuel Moffat who fought  in the battle of Bothwell Bridge.   (II) William, son of Samuel Moffat, immi-  grated to New Jersey at an early date. He   married and among his children were : i.   Samuel, born in Ballylig, Ireland, July i8,  1704: when he came to America is not known,  but he died here May 17, 1787; in 1752 he  moved from Woodbridge, New Jersey, to  Blagg's Cove, Ulster county. New York; he  married (first) Ruth Burns, who died June  5, 1734; (second) at Woodbridge, New Jer-  sey, June 5, 1735, Anne Gregg, a native of  Ireland ; his children were : William, Thom-  as, Samuel, John, Jane, Isaac, Elizabeth, i\Iar-  garet, Anna, Mary, Elinor and Catherine. 2.   Thomas, married, in 1750, ; located in   Goshen, Orange county. New York. 3. Wil-  liam, resided in Somerset county. New Jersey,  in 1752-53; his sons Samuel and ^\'illiam  served in the revolutionary war. 4. Mary,  married James Barkley, of Ulster county,  New York ; children : Samuel, John, James,  William, Thomas, Mary and Margaret. 5.  John, of whom further.   (Ill) Rev. John Moft'at, son of William  Moffat, was born probably at or near \\'ood-  bridge, New Jersey (date unknown), and died  in Little Britain, New York, April 22, 1788.  Very little is known of his boyhood days, but  he must have been of a studious turn of mind,  as he was enabled to enter the College of New  Jersey (now Princeton University) in May,  1747, being one of the first students to regis-  ter. He graduated in the second class to  leave this college, September 27, 1749, with  the degree of Bachelor of Arts. He studied  theology, and May 30, 1750. was licensed to  preach by the Presbytery of New York, and  October 4 of the same year he was ordained  by the same presbytery. The following year  he was called to and installed as pastor of the  Wallkill or Goodwill church, near the village  of Montgomery, in Orange (now Ulster)  county. New York, and there he remained  until 1769. The reason for his leaving this  church is not definitely known, but it is be-  lieved that the theological differences which  were so rife in Presbyterianism at that time  were the causes of his resigning the pastorate.  That he was an energetic pastor is shown bv  the many improvements made on the church  property. In 1765. through his persistent  labors, a new church edifice was erected, and     NEW YORK 333   .July I, 1766, a farm of one hundred acres  adjonung the church was purchased. He en-  gaged m teaching for several years, and dur-   7ltjT-t '^'^'^' ''' ^'-''g'^' ^ L;tin school  at Little Bntam. He was a successful teacher  and numbered among his students representa-  tive, of the best families in that section of the  state. A bill rendered General James Clinton  under date of February 15, i7'8i, is of hh-  toncal interest, as it shows the low cost of  securing an education in those days :   To 2^ years schooling of Alexander and   Charles, at £.5 per year £90 m   lo 2 years and 27 days, George. . .

He  received a liberal education, and at an early  age began the work of a surveyor, in which  vocation he was very successful. In company  with Simon De Witt, cousin of Governor De  Witt Clinton, he surveyed many thousands of  acres of land in Western New York, then  being rapidly developed. It was in one of  the trips in the summer of 1788 that he  caught a severe cold by plunging on a hot  day into a stream of water ; the cold developed  into consumption, of which he died the fol-  lowing February. He met with success in  his surveying and business enterprises, and  acquired a valuable property. His sister, Mrs.  Howe, described him as 'tall and very hand-  some and devoted to athletics, excelling in all  competitions as a rider, swimmer, jumper and  wrestler.' During the first few years after     his marriage he resided in New Britain, and  later in Goshen, where he owned a large house  which subsequently became the summer resi-  dence of Ogden Hoffman, of New York City.

About 1835 he located in  the valley of the Nacoochie, in Northern  Georgia, to develop a gold mine he had pur-  chased. He had previously owned a gold mine  in North Carolina. In 1849 he joined the  band of 'forty-niners' and crossed the plains     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     337     to California.

(VI) Dr. Reuben Curtis Moffat, son of  John Little (2) and Hannah (Curtis) Moffat,  was born in Ithaca, New York, December 11.     1818, died in Brooklyn, New York, August  28, 1894. He graduated in 1846 from the  medical department of the University of the  City of New York with the degree of M.D.,  and began the practice of his profession in  New York. In a short time he removed to  Newtown, Long Island, and in July, 1849, he  located in Brooklyn, New York, where he  made his home until his death. He became  an early advocate and practitioner of the prin-  ciples of homeopathy and continued until his  death a stalwart champion of this school of  medicine. In 1883 the Regents of the Uni-  versity of the State of New York, in recog-  nition of his distinguished success in his pro-  fession, conferred upon him the honorary de-  gree of Doctor of Medicine. Early in life  Dr. Moffat became a convert to the teaching  of the church of the New Jerusalem (popu-  larly known as the Swedenborgian church).  He was one of the organizers of the church  in Brooklyn, and until a clergyman was se-  cured he conducted the service. For many  years he taught a class in the church, giving  up the work only when his health failed and  he was obliged to retire from all active work,  about a year previous to his death. He was  a deep student of the teachings of the church,  and at an early age began collecting the works  of Swedenborg and the publications of the  denomination until he possessed one of the  finest and most complete libraries in the coun-  try. This library he placed at the disposal of  the public until the Brooklyn Society of the  New Church had opened their more modern  library. Dr. Moffat was an able physician.  He loved his fellowmen, loved to work among  them, loved to help them in their need, and  love of this kind begets a love which finds  expression in genuine sorrow when death  severs the tie.   He married, in Newark, New Jersey, April  IS, 1852, Elizabeth Virginia Barclay (see Bar-  clay II), daughter of George Brinley and  Abigail (Shaw) Barclay. She was born in  Cranbury.

This famous Scotch family is of ancient  French ancestry, dating back to Roger, who  came to England with William the Conqueror,  and was given by William Fitz Osborn, his  minister, the manor of Berkeley in Gloucester-  shire. This Roger assumed the name of de  Barchelai (de Berkeley), and havin.g given  support to Stephen he was driven from Berke-  ley manor by Henry II., when he ascended  the thorne. The valuable estate was given to  Robert Harding, who assumed the name of  Berkeley, thus founding another family that  bore the name of Berkeley and Barclay.  Henry II., in order to conciliate Roger de  Barchelai, gave him the manor of Dursley and  several other valuable estates. The name Bar-  clay is the same as the English Berkcleys, and  it was not until the fifteenth century that the  'de' was dropped from the name, and then  by one, Alexander, son of David, who prob-  ably did not like anything that savored of  French. About this time the spelling was  changed from Berkeley to Barclay. The  Saxon Glastershire Berkleys became extinct  in the male line at the death of John de Berk-  lev in 1 33 1, and the representative of the  family then went to the descendants of John  de Berchelai. who had accomnanied Margaret,  sister of Edgar Aetheline to Scotland in 1071,  and to whom the lands of Towie were granted  by Malcolm Caenmoir, her husband. King of  Scotland. A descendant of John de Berchelai,  \\'alter de Berkeley, was chamberlain of the  kingdom in n6.=; Members of the family  have been prominent in the history of Eng-  land and .Scotland. Several members of the  family immigrated to America at an early  date. Tohn Barclay, second son of Colonel  David Barclay, of LTrv. settled in East New  Jersey in 1(^84. and died in Perth Amboy in     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     339     1 73 1. Another member of the Barclay fam-  ily, though not of the Barclays of Ury, was  Rev. Thomas Barclay, the first rector of St.  Peter's Church at Albany. He was born about  1 668, died in 1725. He married Anna Doro-  thea, daughter of Captain Andries and Ger-  trude (Van Shaick) Drauyer. They had four  children whose descendants have intermarried  with many of the most distinguished families  of New York.   The Barclay family of Philadelphia sprang  from John Barclay, who ser\'ed as mayor of  Philadelphia, and died there in 18 16.   Another long line descended from Thomas  Barclay, who was born in Strabane, Ireland,  in 1728. At an early date he immigrated to  America and became prominent in diplomatic  service of the United States. He married  Mary Hoops, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Many of his descendants live in Virginia,  West Virginia, and other southern states.   (I) The branch of the family given below  descends from Thomas Barclay, born in St.  Mary's county, Maryland, March 18, 1755.  From family tradition he is believed to have  been a son of Robert Barclay, of Dublin, bom  in 1718. who was a grandson of Robert Bar-  clay, of Ury. Scotland, the famous apologist  of the Quakers, but the connection has never  been established. Thomas Barclay was a gal-  lant soldier in the American army during the  revolutionary war. On July 12, T776, he en-  listed from St. Mary's county. Maridand, in  the 'Flving Camp', in which organization he  served for some time. In 1779 he was a mem-  ber of Major Anderson's battalion of the  Third Mar>dand Regiment, which served in  General \\^a?hington's command in New Jer-  sey. After the war he located in Shrews-  burv, New Jersey, where he made his home  until hi? death in 1804. While serving with  his command in Shrewsbury, New Jersey, he  met Catherine, daughter of John Williams,  whose property had been confiscated by the  continental congress, and who was himself a  fueitive because of his lovalty to the King.  Soon after the war he married Miss Williams.  Seven children were born of this marriage :  I. Robert, born August 4. 178^, died unmar-  ried. Tune T2. 18^5. 2.

George, born May 23, 1827, died October 3,  the same year.   The Pierrepont family,  PIERREPONT which is inseparably con-  nected with the history  of New York state, is of Norman origin, an-  tedating the Conquest. The castle of Pierre-  pont, which derived its name in the time of  Charlemagne from a stone bridge built nearby  to take the place of a ferry, lay in the south-  erly portion of Picardy. diocese of Laon,  about six miles from St. Sauveur, Normandy.  The earliest lord of the castle was Sir Hugh  de Pierrepont, who lived about 980 A. D. He  was succeeded by his son. Sir Godfrey de  Pierrepont, who left two sons, Sir Godfrey  and Sir Robert. The former was the father  of Sir Ingolbrand de Pierrepont, lord of the  castle in logo A. D., and ancestor of the  French family of Pierrepont. Sir Robert ac-  companied William the Conqueror to Eng-  land, took part in the battle of blastings. io6(3  A. D.. and was the founder of the English  branch. That he stood high with the Con-  queror is attested by the fact that many honors  and estates were bestowed upon him by the  Kin? He possessed, according to the Domes-  day Book, a memorial of the possessors of the  lands in England, of Henestede and Wrcthem  in Suffolk, and he held them of the famous  William. Duke of Normandy, afterward King  of England. Godfrey de Pierrepont held the  hundred of Belinga of said earl. The family  continued in their possessions, viz. : The cas-  tle of Pierrepont, in the south confines of  Picardv, and were benefactors to the abbev  of Thionville for lands in the territory of  Sorincourt and Veel. Sir Robert de Pierre-  pont relinquished all claim to the Normandy  estate and settled definitely in Eneland. and  it appears that, besides those lordships in Suf-  folk and Hurst in Sussex, which now retains  the name of Hurst-Pierrepont. he held other  lands of great extent in said county, amount-  ing to ten knights' fees. As generation suc-  ceeded generation the Pierreponts intermar-  ried with the high nobility of England and     became Anglicized. The arms borne by the  family of Holme-Pierrepont at the time the  American branch left England for the New  W'orld, which are used by the Pierrepont fam-  ily in the United States, are : Argent, semee  of cinquefoils, gules. A lion rampant, sable.  Crest : A fox passant proper, on a wreath.  Motto : Pie repone te. The chief seats of  the English family are: Holme-Pierrepont. a  stately pile and the ancient seat and burial  place of the family, three miles from Notting-  ham and ninety-eight from London ; Thores-  by Park, in the Forest of Sherwood, and Tong  Castle, in Salop.

(A'HI) Charles Hamilton, son of Thomas  and Harriet Cordelia (Eldridge) Sabin, was  born in Williamstown. Massachusetts, .August  24. tS68. He attended the Greylock Institute  of his native place, graduating in 1885. Shortly  afterward he received an offer to enter the  office of Henry Russell, at Albany, New  York, then doing the largest fiour commission  business of any firm in the state. Here he re-  mained two years, when he began his career  in the field of banking, since which time he  has made steadv progress until becoming as  well and favorablv known as nearly any man  of his age in metropolitan financial circles. He     entered the National Commercial Bank of  Albany as a clerk in 1887; was made teller  of the Park Bank of that city in 1889, and  was its cashier until Jaimary 16, 1898, when  he vyas appointed cashier of the Albany City  National Bank. When this institution was ac-  quired by the National Commercial Bank in  1902, Mr. Sabin returned to the latter as its  vice-president, a position of some moment for  so young a man, as it ranked as the largest  bank of the Capital City. He continued there,  winning many friends in the business world  by his affability, connected with those qual-  ities which stamp a man as banker, until May,  1907, when he was called to the National Cop-  per Bank of New York City to be its presi-  dent. In announcing Mr. Sabin's retirement  from the National Commercial Bank, Presi-  dent Robert C. Pruyn took occasion to state  to the board : 'We feel that it is a great com-  pliment that one from our institution should  have been so highly honored, and we feel  heartily glad of his promotion. He has been  a conscientious worker ever since he began  his career, and very justly is one of the most  popular young men of Albany. I tell you  this because I know that Mr. Sabin's natural  modesty will prevent him from saying it.' His  advancement to this office in New York was  regarded in banking circles as a fitting testi-  monial to his worth and high abilities ; he is  a fine type of self-made man, winning every  honor that had fallen to him by hard work  and efficiency of the highest order.   In less than a year after his assuming the  presidency of the National Copper Bank, the  progress made by this institution was indeed  remarkable. It was established May i, 1907,  at No. 115 Broadway, and reported at the  close of business on February 14, 1908, or  only nine and a half months after organiza-  tion, a surplus and undivided profits of $2,251,-  082.62, and deposits amounting to $14,026,-  623.83, with cash on hand. $2,803,460.51 ; due  from' banks, $2,282,339.38; United^ States  bonds. $1,150,000, and bonds, securities, etc.,  $1,902,656.80, an exhibition of great strength.  When the National Copper Bank was merged  with the Mechanics <.1- Metals Bank, at No.  33 Wall street, Mr. Sabin was made its vice-  president, and on June 23, 1910, was elected  vice-president of the Guaranty Trust Com-  pany of New York, at No. 28 Nassau street  to succeed Mr. Charles H. Allen, which posi-     348     SOUTHERN' NEW YORK     tion he occupied in 19 12. The National Cop-  per Bank represented the great copper inter-  ests of this country, being controlled by such  men of prominence in finance as Thomas F.  Cole, John D. Ryan, Urban H. Broughton,  William A. Paine, Henry H. Rogers Jr.,  Adolph Lcwisohn, Charles F. Brook.   Mr. Sabin was made president of the New  York State Bankers' Association in January,  1904, and in his address before the conven-  tion, held at the Frontenac, Thousand Islands,  be spoke forcefully of conservative business  management of banks, the encouragement of  enterprise, and strongly advocated the admis-  sion of trust companies into the association's  ranks. The Council of Administration, on  behalf of his active, intelligent interest, pre-  sented him with a silver gavel on this occasion,  and he was chosen delegate to the American  Bankers' convention. He was treasurer for  three years of the Young Men's Association  of Albany, and its president in 1897; was  elected president of the Old Guard, Albany  Zouave Cadets, Company A, of the Tenth  Regiment, National Guard, New York. On  December 16, iQio, he gave a luncheon to  Governor-Elect John A. Dix, which was at-  tended by the leading bankers of New York  City, intending thereby to have the governor  sound the views of the financial world as it  might affect the new administration.   Mr. .'^ahin has a summer home at Mon-  mouth Beach. New Jersey, where, as a mem-  ber of the Rumson Country Club, he is an  active particii)ant in polo and other athletics.  He is a member of the Metropolitan, Union  League, Riding, Racquet & Tennis clubs of  New York City, and of the Albany Country.  Albany Polo and Fort Orange clubs of Al-  bany. He is also a member of Holland Lodge,  Free and Accepted Masons.   Mr. Sabin married at Albany. New York,  December 20. 1S07, Mabel Whitney, born at  Albany, December 4, 1874, daughter of Will-  iam Minott WMiitney, of Albanv (see Whit-  ney VTF). They have one child, Charles Ham-  ilton Jr., born at Albany, New York, July 4,  1902.   (Tlie Wliitney TJne.)   The family name of Whitney is derived  from the Anglo-Saxon word 'hwit.' meaning  white, and 'ey,' meaning water, literally sig-  nifying 'white water,' or 'the clear running  stream.' Others incline to the derivation     'withig,' willow; or 'witan,' assembly, and  'ey' or 'ige,' which may mean island as well  as water, so that it could signify the 'Island  of Willows,' or 'Island of Assembly,' the ad-  vocates of the latter idea pointing out that the  place where this family originated was an ex-  ceptionally good locality for the assemblyingof  large gatherings, such as armies or tourneys;  but as a matter of fact the line of descent  is traced in direct course to the time when the  Whitney family lived beside the Wye river,  coursing through Wales and England, and  forming in its lower course the boundary be-  tween Monmouthshire and Gloucestershire,  joining the estuary of the river Severn, eleven  miles north by west of Bristol, England. Its  length is about one hundred and thirty miles,  navigable to Hereford, and the stream is  noted for its picturesque scenery, in fact so  beautiful is the river Wye, made attractive by  its castellated shores, that it is well called 'the  Rhine of England.' It was appointed the  boundary between England and Wales by  Athelstan in the year 939. The early own-  ers of the land were, before the days of sur-  names, known as 'Eustace' or 'Baldwin,' or  'Robert of Whitney,' as the Christian name  might be. Written in the style of those times,  'of' was 'de' and after a while, 'De Whit-  ney,' or 'De Wyttebeye,' as it was usually  spelled, came to be regarded as the family  name. Finally the letter 'h' was introduced  and the 'de' was dropp>ed, so that throughout  four centuries the present form has been the  established one. It also shows on old Eng-  lish records as Witney, Wittney, Witnenie,  Witeney, Witteneye, Wytney, Wyttneye,  Wyteney. Wytteneye, Whiteneye and Wliit-  tenye. The Whitney Arms : Shield, Azure, a  cross chequy or and gules. Crest: A bull's  head couped sable, armed argent, the points  gules. Motto : Magnanimiter crucem sustene ;  'Gallantly uphold the cross.' Registered in the  College of Arms, and probably originated dur-  ing the early Crusades, it remained imchanged  up to the time of emigration of John Whit-  ney, in 1635.   Regarding the origin of the family and its  location, as it leads towards the departure  of a member in direct descent, who became  the progenitor of the family in America, there  is much of interest, and it must necessarily be  expressed in brief. At the present dav there  is a tract in England known as 'Whitney     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     349     Wood,' probably identical with the one re-  ferred to in a writ of the seventeenth year of  Henry ill. (1233), wherein sheriff of Here-  ford was commanded to cause a good breach  to be made through the woods of Erdelegh,  Bronilegh and Witteneye, so that there may  be safe passage between the City of Here-  ford and Maud's Castle. This castle was built  by William le Brass, Lord of Brecknock,  about 1216, in the reign of King John, and  so named in honor of his wife. The Doomes-  day Book mentiones Whitney in the year  1086, at which time the land was scarcely  under cultivation, as follows : 'In Elsedune  hundred, the King holds Witemie, Aluuard  held it in the time of King Edward, and was  able to go where he pleased. There is half a  hide yielding geld. It was and is waste.'   Rolf, or Guy, has the credit of being the  first of whom there is undisputed, authentic  trace. He had a son, Turstin de Wigemore,  the Fleming, who was living in 1086, and mar-  ried Agnes, daughter of Alured de Merle-  berge, of Ewias Castle. Their son was Eus-  tace, who, 'at the request of my mother,  Aene=, have given to .St. Peter and the broth-  ers of Gloucester a hide of land in Pencombe,  which is called Suthenhale (Sydnal), free and  clear from any encumbrance ; and through  this deed, I have placed it on the altar of  Saint Peter of Gloucester.' Eustace had a  son, also named Eustace de Wytteneye,  Knight, who confirmed this deed of grift, by  f document so signed and delivered to 'the  Monks and Lord Reginald. Abbot of Saint  Peter's at Gloucester, and to the convent of  that place.' Thus, while there may be no  record showinsr that Eustace, the elder, used  the name in full, his son, in the days of Reg-  inald the Abbot, or 1263-84, wrote himself as  'Eustace de Wytteneye,' and it is therefore  proved that he was third in descent from Tur-  stin the Fleming, son of Rolf, who owned  the land on the river Wye, the home of the  Wyfteneyes, later changed to Whitney in rec-  ords.   That the Whitney family was reoresented  in the Crusades seems more than likely, for  a cross on a coat-of-arms, which is known pos-  itively to date to that period is quite generally  understood bv the most careful students of  ancient heraldrv to indicate that it once be-  loneed to a crusade, and in the Whitney arms,  the chief, in fact, the only solitary symbol is     a cross. Nearly every writer dealing with the  history of this family has given the following  explanation :   'Sir Randolph de Whitney, the grandson of  Eustace, accompanied Ricliard Cocur de Lion to the  Crusades, and distinguished himself greatly by his  personal strength and great courage. On one oc-  casion he was sent by Richard on a mission to the  French commander and, as he was leaving the Brit-  ish camp the brother of Saladin (whom he had  twice before defeated) followed him with two Sar-  acens in his company, and, riding around a small  hill, made a furious attack upon De Whitney, who  defended himself with the greatest vigor; but his  assailants were gaining upon him, when a furious  Spanish bull, which was feeding near the field of  conflict, was attracted hy the red dresses of the  Saracen.s, and becoming angry at the color tlitling  before him, made so vigorous an attack upon them  that they were diverted from their intended prey,  and sought safety in flight. Sir Randolph soon suc-  ceeded in wounding his single assailant, whom he  left for dead, and then, overtaking the two Saracens,  dispatched them and proceeded upon his mission  from the King.'   To carry the entire line, even by name and  date from the time of Turstin, son of Rolf,  in 10S6, to the time of John Whitney, who  emigrated to America in 1635, more than two  and a half centuries ago, would require much  space; but in brief it perfects the family his-  tory. Sir Robert de Whitney, of Whitney,  Knight, living in 1242, had son, Sir Eustace  de Whitney, Knight, who was granted Free  Warren by King Edward I., in 1284, and was  summoned to military service beyond the seas  in 1297, and summoned to the Scotch war in  1301. His son was Sir Eustace de Whitney,  of Whitney, who was knighted by Edward t.,  in 1306, and was member of parliament for  Herefordshire in 1313 and 1352. His son was  Sir Robert de Whitney, Knight, one of two  hundred gentlemen, who in 1368 went to  Milan in the retinue of the Duke of Clarence,  and was member of parliament for Hereford-  shire in 1377-79-80. His son, Robert, was  sent abroad to negotiate a treaty with the  Count of Flanders in 1388; was member of  Parliament in 1 391 : was sent to France to de-  liver the castle and town of Cherbourg to the  King of Navarre in 1393: was Knight Mar-  shall at the Court of Richard II. ; was killed,  with his brother and relatives, at the battle  of Pilleth, in 1402. His son. Sir Robert  Whitney, of Whitney, Knieht. was granted  the Castle of Clifford and lordships of Clifford  and Glashurv, by Henry IV.. in 1404. pn  account of his service; was member of parlia-     350     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     ment, 1416-22; fought in the French war un-  der Henry V., was captain of castle and town  of Vire, in 1420, and died March 12, 1441.  His son Eustace de Whitney, Knight, born  141 1, was head of the commission sent to  Wales by Henry VI., in 1455 ! member of  parliament for Herefordshire, 1468; married  Jenett Russell, daughter of Sir Thomas. His  son, Robert, probably also a knight, was an  active participant in the War of the Roses;  attained as a Yorkist by Lancastrain parlia-  ment, in 1459; probably was at battle of Mor-  timer's Cross, in 1461, and was the subject of  a poem by Lewis Glyn Cothi, on his marriage  to Constance, the great-granddaughter of Sir  David Gam. His son. James Whitney, was  appointed receiver of Newport, part of the  estate of the Duke of Buckingham, confis-  cated by Henry VHI., in 1522. His son,  Robert, of Icomb, was placed in charge of  Brecknock, Hay and Huntington, the confis-  cated estates of the Duke of Buckingham, in  1523; was nominated Knight of Bath by  Henry VHI., at coronation of Anne Boleyn,  in 1 53 1, and died in 1541. He furnished forty  men to put down rebellion in 1536. He mar-  ried Margaret, daughter of Robert Wye. of  Gloucestershire. England. His son. Sir Rob-  ert Whitney, Knisfht, was dubbed in October,  1553, the day following Queen Mary's coro-  nation : was summoned before the privy coun-  cil in 155.S-59: member of parliament for  Herefordshire, 1550. and died August 5, 1567.  His son. .Sir James Whitnev, born in 1544,  was knighted by Queen Elizabeth at Windsor,  in i.t;7o; was sheriff of Herefordshire i';74-  86-87: died May 31. 15R7. His brother, Rob-  ert Whitney, married Elizabeth, daughter of  Morean C,rTilIim<;. of Dnelim. who had a son  Thomas ^^^litney, of Westminster, Gentlemen,  sec forward.   Thomas Whitnev. son of Robert and Eliza-  beth (Guillims') Whitney, was a native of  Westminster. England, and was buried in St.  Margaret's, April 14. 1637. It is recorded  that in 161 1 he paid the subsidv tax. and on  December 6. t6t!;. on the probate of the will  of bis father-in-law. John Brav. he was ap-  pointed executor. He apprenticed his son.  John, on Februarv 22. 1607, and his son. Rob-  ert, on November 8. 1624. At the time of his  death in i6'?7. his oldcit survivine son. John,  being out of the cotmtrv. administration of  his estate was granted. May 8. 1637. to his     remaining sons, Francis and Robert. Of the  other six children, he having had nine, all six  were then dead. He obtained, May 10, 1583,  from the Dean and Chapter of Westminster,  a license to marry Mary Bray, in which docu-  ment he is mentioned as 'Thomas Whytney  of Lambeth Marsh, Gentleman,' and the mar-  riage took place on May 12 at St. Margaret's  Church. She was the daughter of John Bray,  of Westminster, and she was buried in St.  Margaret's, September 25, 1629. 'Lambeth  Marsh' is the name still existing and denotes  a locality near the Surrey end of the West-  minster bridge. Children: Margaret, born  1584, died 1604; Thomas, 1587, died 1587;  Henry, 1588, died 1589; John, see forward;  Arnwaye, 1590, died 1591 ; Nowell, 1594. died  1597; Francis, 1599, died at Westminster,  1643: Mary. i6cx3, died i6oo; Robert, 1605,  died in Parish of St. Peter's, Cornhill, Lon-  don, England, 1662.   (I) John Whitney, son of Thomas and  Mary (Bray) Whitney, was born in West-  minster, England, was baptized in St. Mar-  garet's Church, July 20, 1593, and coming to  America in 1635, died at 'VX^atertown, Massa-  chusetts. June T, 1673. He was reported  'Gentleman' in his marriage license taken out  in England, and it is presumed that his edu-  cation in the famous 'Westminster School'  now known as St. Peter's College, was a good  one. When fourteen years old he was ap-  prenticed by his father, February 22, 1607,  to William Pring. of the Old Bailey, London,  who was a 'freeman' of the Merchant Tay-  lor's Company, then the most famous and  prosperous of all the great trade guilds, num-  bering in its membership distinguished men  of the professions, nobility and the Prince of  Wales. On March 13, 1614. when twenty-one  years of age. he became a full flcdcfed member.  He made his residence at Tsleworth-on-  Thames, eight miles from his Westminster   home, and about t6i8. married Eleanor ,   who was born in England. 1599. and six chil-  dren were born to him before sailing to Amer-  ica, three afterwards. His father apprenticed  to him his youngest brother. Robert. Novem-  ber 8. 1624. who served seven years. He re-  moved, about 16'? I. to London, where entries  in the register of St. Mary Aldermerv indi-  cate that he resided in 'Bowe lanne.' near  Bow Church, where hang the famous bells.  Early in April, 1635. he registered with his     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     351     wife, Eleanor, and their sons, John, Richard,  Nathaniel, Thomas and Jonathan, as passen-  gers in the ship 'Elizabeth and Ann', Roger  Cooper, master. They arrived at Watertown,  Massachusetts, in June, and settled there,  where their son, Joshua, was born July 15.  John Whitney purchased a sixteen acre home-  stall which had been granted to John Strick-  land, who had been dismissed from the Water-  town church. May 29, 1635. and was one of  that colony to remove and plant Wethersfield,  Connecticut. His homestead was the perma-  nent home of John Whitney. It was situated  a short distance north of Belmont street and  east of Common street. In 1668 he requested  his youngest son, Benjamin, who had settled  in York. Maine, to retiirn and live with him  at the homestead, assuring him that it should  be his after his death. With the father's con-  sent, Benjamin conveyed his rights for forty  pounds in 1671 to his brother, Joshua, and  when his father died, Joshua returned to Gro-  ten, and October 20, 1697, sold the homestead  to Deacon Nathan Fiske. John Whitney was  admitted freeman. March 3, 1635-36, was ap-  pointed constable of Watertown, June i, 1641,  by the general court, selectman, 1638 to 1655  inclusive, and town clerk, 1655.

(V) Bris^adier-General Josiah Whitney, son  of Richard (3) and Hannah fWhitcomb)  Whitney, was born in Stow. Massachusetts,  October 12, 1731, died in Albany, Massachu-  setts. January 24, 1806. He was the citizen  of Harvard, Massachusetts, who held the  highest military rank during the revolution,  and was at one time the town's most noted  and influential citizen, being the leader in  town politics. His mother was a near relative  of the veteran militarv leaders. Colonel Asa  and General John W'hitcomb. On September  2. 1746. his parents deeded to him land in  Harvard, which he occupied soon after his  marriage, his dwelling standing nearly opDO-  site the almshouse, until torn down in 1869.  He iiiberited a fondness for military' affairs.  and when about his majority he entered upon  what proved a most brilliant military career. In  the spring of 1755 he was a member of thecom-  pany commanded hv Cantnin \\'illiam Pierce,  that marched in Colonel Whitcomb's regiment  against the French and Indians at Crown  Point. He was in the notoriously bloody bat-  tle at Lake George. September 8, I7=;v where  the valiant General Dieskau was defeated bv  the New England yeomanry. From .'Vup'ust  13 to 26. 1757. he was a member of the foot  company commanded bv Captain Israel Tay-  lor that marched on the late alarm for the  relief of Fort Henrv. as far as Sprinfrfield,  and on September 26, 1774. he was chosen  commander of a company. When on Decem-  ber TC), T774. the Continental Resolves were  rend before the town, a committee was ap-  pointed to prepare a covenant to be sifrned bv  the inhabitants, pledging adherence to inde-     pendence, he was one of ten named to inspect  breaches of the covenant. Colonel Asa Whit-  comb, having been authorized to raise a regi-  ment at the time of the provincial congress,  April, 1774, he did so. and on May 25, an-  nounced that Josiah Whitney, of Harvard,  was lieutenant-colonel. That regiment con-  tained five hundred and sixty volunteers, mus-  tered into eleven companies, and was the  largest of the twenty-six Massachusetts regi-  ments before Boston. He was appointed to  take command of a battalion of men raised  by the state. April 10, 1776, and on October  29, wrote from camp at Hull, ''though the  pay of the state was small, yet my zeal for  the liberties of my country was so great that  I cheerfully undertook it.' When the conti-  nental army departed for New York, his regi-  ment went with the Massachusetts militia to  the defense of the coast. When General Bur-  goyne was marching toward Albany from the  north, he ordered, on July 27, 1777, a draft  of one-sixth of the training bands and alarm  lists in his regiment to march at once to Ben-  nington and on August 2. ordered one-half of  the militia to follow. On January 13, 1778,  he was made chainnan of a committee which  the town had appointed 'to take into consid-  eration the Articles of Confederation and Per-  petual Union of the United States of America  Concerted on by Congress.' He was com-  mander of the Second Worcester Regiment  of Militia, as colonel, when it took part in the  operation in Rhode Island, when in .'\ugust  and September, 1778, an attempt was made to  wrest that colony from the others. He was  chosen one of two delegates to be sent to the  convention for the state constitution. He was  made brigadier-general in 1783. hut resigned  the office before the breaking out of Shay's in-  surrection. In T782 the governor appointed him  a justice of the peace in and for the county  of Worcester. In 1783-84-87-88-89 he was a  member of the board of selectmen, and during  this period one of the most popular moder-  ators at the deliberations of the town voters.  He was the delegate from Harvard to the con-  vention held to ratify the federal constitution  in Boston. January 0. 1788. and voted with the  minority in opposition but would support it  nevertheless. He was representative in the  legislature. 1780-81-87-88-80.

(VII) William Minott, son of Daniel and  Hannah (Shedd) Whitney, was born in Bos-  ton, Massachusetts, January 2. 1827, died at  his residence. No. 156 Washington avenue,  Albany, New York, May, 1905. His par-  ents resided in Boston until they removed  bv boat trip in 182S to New York City. At  the start of his career, he found employment  in a metropolitan dry goods establishment,  and then in a wholesale dry-goods house. He  soon became recognized as an expert in the  buving of goods, and from 1845 to 1859 was  chief buyer for various large houses. The large  store, Nos. 43-45-47-49 North Pearl street, Al-  bany, to which he was to devote the larger  share of his life, was opened in 1859 by Ubs-  dell, Pierson & Company, and in i8fV) he came  to Albany as their manager. In 1R62, when  Tames T. Lenox purchased the business, Mr.  Whitney continued to represent the new man-  agement. In 1865 he formed a partnership  with John G. Myers by the purchase of the  Lenox store, and the place became widely  known as t4ie 'New York Store.' Its busi-  ness increased until it became the most ex-     o54     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     tensive of its kind between the metropolis and  Chicago. This arrangement continued until  1870, when Mr. Myers retired, and Mr. Whit-  ney continued the business alone until 1877,  when he admitted William H. Pangburn and  S. M. Van Santwoord as partners. Twelve  years later this firm was dissolved, and Mr.  Whitney continued the business with his son,  William M. Whitney Jr. In 1896 he admitted  his other son, Charles L. A. Whitney, as a  partner, which resulted in its continuation as  one of the most enterprising and successful  concerns in this part of the country. Mr.  Whitney was a Mason, a member of the Uni-  versalist church, and a member of the Fort  Orange and Albany clubs. He was a director  of the First National Bank, and in 1886, by  appointment of the mayor, served as chairman  on the committee of public celebration which  arranged the Bi-Centennial of Albany as a  chartered city. For many years Mr. Whitney  resided in his handsome home, No. 5 Lodge  street, but removed to a larger residence. No.  156 Washington avenue, where he died at  five o'clock on the morning of May 10, 1905,  having sufTcred a stroke of apoplexy the  previous day.   William M. Whitney married, in New York  City, June 16, 1856, Amelia Cook, born in  New York City, January 31, 1831, and in 1910  was living in Albany. Her parents were Wal-  ter and Mary (Munro) Cook.

Mabel, born at Albany, December 4,  1874 ; married, Albany, December 29, 1897,  Charles Hamilton Sabin, of New York (see  Sabin VHI).     The surname, Warren, is de-  WARREN rived from Gareme or Gar-   enne, a small river in the old  county of Calilas or Caux, in Normandy,  which gave its name to the neighboring com-  mune, and is only a few miles from Dieppe.  There is at present a village called Garenne  in the same district, and it is here that the  origin of the family has been fixed by his-  torians. On the west side of the river Gar-  enne was the ancient baronial seat of the De  Warrens, and some of the ruins were standing  in 1832. The surname has assumed different  forms at different times — Gareyn, ^^'arreyn,  Waryn, Warin, Waring, Warynge, W'aryng  and Warren. That branch of the family with  which this sketch deals (in Connecticut)  spelled the name Waring until recent genera-  tions.   The ancestor of perhaps all the English,  Irish and Scotch families of the name of  Warren is said by one authority to be William  de Warrenne, who went to England with Wil-  liam the Conqueror, and was related to him  both by marriage and descent. He had a con-  siderable command at the battle of Hastings,  where the English were defeated by the Nor-  mans with such lasting results, and on account  of his valor and fidelity obtained immense  grants of land from the Conqueror. He had  Ipnds in Shro])sliirc, Essex, Suffolk, O.xford,  Hants, Cambridgeshire, Rucks, Huntington,  Bedfordshire, Norfolk, Lincoln and Yorks,  amounting in all, according to Hume, to three  hundred lordships. He became the first Earl  of W'arren and Surrey. His wife Gundreda,  daughter of W'illiam d) and descendant of  Charlemagne, died May 27, 1085, and was  buried in the chapter-house of the Priory of  Lewes, county Sussex. Her tombstone is still  in existence. The earl died June 24, 1088.  His epitaph has been preserved, thoutrh the  gravestone is lost or destroyed. In 184s the  coffers containing the bones of the earl and  the countess were disinterred and are now in  the church of St. John the Baptist, Southover.     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     355     The history of the Warren family has been  written and is exceeded in interesting an-  tiquity by none in England.   (I) Christopher Warren, progenitor of the  New England branch of the Warrens, is sup-  posed to have had three sons — Sir John, who  came to Boston in 1631 ; one settled in Water-  town, Massachusetts ; Richard, mentioned be-  low.   (II) Richard, son of Christopher Warren,  and the immigrant ancestor of the New Eng-  land family, emigrated in 1664 on the ship  'Endeavor' from southern England to Bos-  ton. The party with v\'hich he came settled  the next year at Brookhaven, Long Island, on  land bought by them from the Setauket tribe  of Indians, for the purchase of which a patent  of confirmation was obtained March 7, 1666.  In 1685-86 he was tenant of one hundred  acres from James Lloyd, of the manor of  Queen's village, Long Island ; later he owned  land at Huntington, Long Island. He had  four sons: Richard Jr., born before 1664;  Michael ; John ; Edmund, mentioned below.   (III) Edmund Waring, youngest son of  Richard Waring or Warren, was born at  Brookhaven or Oyster Bay. Long Island, in  1673. died August 5, 1749. He removed from  Huntington, Long Island, to Norwalk, Con-  necticut, in 1703, and owned a large tract of  land on Roton Hill and Five Mile river. He  built a pier in the harbor of Norwalk, which  leads to the inference that he was engaged in  mercantile pursuits, probably a lumber mer-  chant, as he made large purchases of timber  land. At his death at the age of seventy-six  he was survived by his entire family, wife,  eight sons, and 'four loving daughters', to  whom he bequeathed a considerable landed es-  tate. He married, October 6. 1698. Elizabeth  Bouton. born in 1679, daughter of Jean or  John Bouton, a Huguenot, born in France,  161 5, came to America, 1635, died at Norwalk.  Connecticut, in 1704. John Bouton married  (third), January i, 1673, Mary Stevenson,  who bore him four children. Elizabeth being  the third, and the tenth child of her father.  The name Bouton has had various spellings,  namely: Boughton, Bowten. Bowtin, Boutin.  Edmund and Elizabeth (Bouton) Waring had  twelve children, all but the youngest born in  Oyster Bay, Long Island : Edmund, born  September 16, 1700: Isaac, June 13. 1702;  John, December 21, 1704; Solomon, April 24,     1707; Mary, December 22, 1708; Nathan,  F'ebruary 6, 171 1; Jacob, January 15, 1713;  Michael, July 16, 1715, married Elizabeth Sco-  field; Eliakim, mentioned below; Elizabeth,  March 8, 1720; Abigail, April ig, 1723; Han-  nah, born in Norwalk, Connecticut, September  7, 1725. The ancient tombstones of Edmund  and his wife were found at Norwalk, Con-  necticut, in 1862.   (IV) Eliakim, son of Edmund and Eliza-  beth (Bouton) Waring, was born at Oyster  Bay, Long Island, July 8, 1717, died at Nor-  walk, Connecticut, August 5, 1779. He was  probably associated with his father and broth-  ers in business, but the records do not give  any information as to his occupation or busi-  ness. He married, December 7, 1738, Ann,  daughter of John (2) Reed, of Norwalk, and  great-granddaughter of John (i) Reed, an of-  ficer in the army of Cromwell. John (i)  Reed died in New England at the advanced  age of ninety-eight. Children, born in Nor-  walk, Connecticut; Zaccheus, October 19,  1741 ; Jesse, June 14, 1744; Eliakim, men-  tioned below. At a meeting of the Associa-  tion of Western Churches (Congregational)  of Fairfield County, convened at Aliddlesex.  June 6, 1744, Edmund and Eliakim Warren  were the chosen Middlesex delegates, and  their wives were at that time added to the  church by letters of recommendation. A Nor-  walk cousin, Joseph (2), son of Joseph (i),  and great-grandson of Edmund (i), was a  personal friend of Major-General Joseph  Warren, and showed with pride the general's  sword, left in his keeping, calling the revolu-  tionary hero his cousin. This Joseph (2)  Warren was in 1798 the owner of the Norwalk  and New York packet line, which comprised  two sloops. 'Grififin' and 'Republican'.   (V) Eliakim (2) Warren, son of Eliakim  (i) and Ann (Reed) Waring, was born Feb-  ruary Q, 1747. died September 4, 1824. It is  with Eliakim (2) that the Troy history of the  family begins. Eliakim married his neighbor,  Phebe Bouton. daughter of Esaias Bouton,  January 17, 1771. Before his marriage he  had belonged to the Congregational church,  but his wife, Phebe Bouton, was an ardent  Episcopalian, and persuaded him to join that  ihurch. In 1787 he was elected vestryman of  St. Paul's Church. Norwalk. and there is ex-  tant the record of an auction of pews where  he and others tossed pennies for seats. Elia-     356     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     kirn had three sons: Esaias, Nathan and  Stephen. On the advice of Esaias they de-  cided to remove to Troy, a thriving village at  the head of navigation on the Hudson river.  The Warren family sailed out of Norwalk  harbor in May, 1798, and made the entire trip  to Troy by water. They had just had a sail-  ing vessel built for them at Rowayton, a sloop  named 'The Three Brothers'. It was fifty  feet keel, twenty feet beam, and sixteen feet  hold, and rated at sixty-four tons. In 1796  Esaias, the eldest son, had purchased a lot on  East River street, between First and Albany  streets. Troy, and there erected a two-story  wooden building for a dwelling and a store.  Eliakim and Esaias, with the second son,  Nathan, engaged in merchandising under the  firm name of Esaias Warren & Company. In  1799 the firm removed their business to the  west side of River street (now No. 217), and  began a retail and wholesale business in dry  goods, groceries and hardware. A feature of  their business was the purchase and shipping  of wheat and country produce. They safely  invested their profits in real estate. After  three years residence in Troy, April 6, 1801,  Eliakim sold out the old Norwalk property  and employed the proceeds in his sons' inter-  ests. Esaias being the eldest and then twenty-  seven years of age took the lead in all matters,  and their early prosperity was largely due to  his enterprise and sagacity. Troy at this  period contained three hundred houses, and  one thousand, eight hundred and two inhabi-  tants. In due time Eliakim Warren retired  from the firm and his place was taken by his  third son, Stephen. Eliakim Warren was a  devout Christian, and believed that a share of  his fortune should be devoted to the service  of God. This was one of his articles of faith  and he so told his sons. In Troy he found nn  Episcopal church. For two years, however,  Sunday services had been held according to  the Book of Common Prayer. Philander  Chase, a young graduate at Dartmouth Col-  lege, (later Bishop of Ohio) had been sent  up regularlv from Albany by Dr. Ellison, the  rector of St. Peter's parish and an English-  man, to minister to the little band of Episco-  palians. But Phebe Warren was a noble wo-  man, and owing to her initiative and perse-  vering eflfort, St. Paul's Church was built in  1804 on the northwest corner of Third and  Congress streets, and according to her wish     was modelled exactly after St. Paul's Church  at Norwalk. Trinity Church, New York City,  contributed two thoiv-^and dollars to its erec-  tion. The Rev. David Butler, of Reading,  Connecticut, was chosen rector by the vestry,  and in his letter of acceptance, he said : 'I  shall endeavor to make myself ready to re-  move with my family whenever it may be con-  venient for Air. Warren to come down with  his vessel'. Dr. Butler in his youth had  served as a soldier in the revolutionary war.  He was a man of learning and ability, and sat  as deputy from the diocese of New York  state in the general convention of 1820, and in  several succeeding conventions. He was a  man of commanding presence and aristocratic  manner, and wore until the close of his life  the small clothes, buckles shoes and long  skirted coat of the earlier period. He served  his people faithfully for thirty years. One  part of St. Paul's Church was quaintly de-  nominated 'Norwalk'. as there sat the War-  rens, Boutons. Kelloggs, Crafts and Cannons.  The Warren family prayer book was on the  altar. At the first recorded administration of  the Holy Communion, three lav members par-  took thereof, Eliakim and Phebe Warren, and  Lemuel Hawley. In 1813 the number of reg-  ular communicants had increased to eighty-  four, and in 1824 a new and larger church,  (the present St. Paul's) was erected on the  northeast corner of Third and State streets.  Mr. \\^arren was one of the first two elected  wardens (senior). Jeremiah Pierce being the  jimior warden, and he continued to hold this  office until his death. In 1S15 his wife, Phebe  (Bouton) W'arren. formed in the parish a  Saturday sewing class for poor girls, which  she conducted until her death in 1835. It was  then carried on by her daughter-in-law, Mary,  wife of Nathan \A'arren. From this sewing  class grew later the 'Church of the Holy  Cross'.   Mr. Warren lived a life of great usefulness,  and was universally loved and respected. He  never had a lawsuit and avoided religious con-  troversy. When the British attack was made  on Norwalk during the revolution he ioined  with his townsmen in the defense of their  homes and beat the British off, not. however,  until nearly all the dwellings were burnt. A  tablet, erected by the vestry, in St. Paul's  Church is inscribed, 'In memory of Eliakim  Warren, senior warden of this church from     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     357     its organization in 1804 until iiis death. To  hiis zeal and munificence the congregation, un-  der God, is indebted for its origin and pros-  perity. He died September 4, 1824, aged sev-  enty-seven years'. The vestry also erected a  tablet inscribed : 'In memory of Phebe War-  ren, relict of Eliakim. She died January 17,  1835, aged eighty years. A mother in Israel.  She supported and conducted a sewing class  for the children of the poor'.   Eliakim Warren married, January 17, 1771,  Phebe, born March 5, 1754, died January 17,  1835, daughter of Esaias and Phebe (Bixby)  Bouton, of Norwalk. Children: i. Esaias,  born in Norwalk, Connecticut, October 16,  1771, died in Troy, New York, April 19, 1829.  2. Hannah, born July 19, 1773, died January,  1775. 3. Hannah (2), born August 30, 1775,  died June, 1776. 4. Nathan, mentioned below.  5. Stephen.   (VI) Nathan, second son of Eliakim (2)  and Phebe (Bouton) Warren, was born in  Norwalk, Connecticut, May 11, 1777, died at  Troy, New York, August 13, 1834. He was  of the firm of Esaias Warren & Company,  Troy, 1798, continuing until March i, 1827.  He was one of the proprietors of the 'Earth-  ern Conduit Company', formed to 'supply the  inhabitants with water'. He was one of the  first board of managers of the Troy Savings  Bank in 1823. He was an original incor-  porator of the Troy Steamboat Company in  1825, vestryman of St. Paul's Church, 1827.  and in the same year erected the 'Mansion  House', at the corner of Second and Albany  streets, Troy. He was an incorporator of the  Troy & Bennington Turnpike Company in  1827, and an incorporator and one of the first  directors of the Rensselaer & Saratoga Rail-  road Company in 1832. He married, April  24, t8o8. ]\Iary. daughter of Nathan and .-Kbi-  gail (Burlock) Bouton, born April 21. 1789,  died February 8, 1859, a descendant of John  Bouton. the Huguenot. She continued the  Saturday sewing class founded by Mrs. Phebe  (Bouton) Warren, her mother-in-law, and  after the death of the latter, continued it into  a day school. After she had been left a  widow Mrs. ^^''arren gave her time almost en-  tirely to church and philosophic work. She  was the founder and donor of the 'Church of  the Holv Cross', Troy, in 1844, 'A house of  prayer for all people, without money and  without price'. The girls' day school was in-     corporated by act of legislature, March 19,  1846. By it Mary Warren, the founder, the  Rev. John Ireland Tucker, and Amos S.  Perry, became a corporate body, by name  'The Warren Free Institute', for 'the pur-  pose of maintaining and conducting a free  school'. December 7, 1848, the Rev. John  Ireland Tucker was ordained to the priesthood  and became the first rector of the Church of  the Holy Cross, April 5, 1849. The name of  the Warren Free Institute was changed by act  of legislature to 'The Mary Warren Free In-  stitute of the City of Troy'. In 1889 the  church was handsomely improved, Dr. Nathan  B., Stephen E. and George Henry Warren  contributing the necessary funds. The en-  larged chancel was dedicated December 24,  1889, on which occasion the choirmen of the  church wore for the first time an ecclesiastical  habit. This church was one of the earliest  of the free churches of the Episcopal com-  munion built in the United States. In it was  first introduced the choral service, and mainly  through the liberality of Dr. Nathan B. War-  ren. The girls who composed the choir were  dressed in a uniform of long scarlet cloaks and  black hats. The children of Mary (Bouton)  Warren were the donors of the organ, the  chime of bells, and the richly colored windows.  Others of the family contributed the beautiful  brass lectern, a fac-simile of the one in Exeter  Cathedral, England, and the brass corona. A  stone tablet set in the west wall of the ante-  chapel reads : 'This church, free to all peo-  ple, was founded bv Marv. widow of Nathan  Warren, A. D., MDCCCVLIV. The ante-  chapel contemplated by the founder was built  by her children as a memorial to their vener-  ated mother, who on the VIII dav of Febru-  ary. A. D. MDCCCLIX in the LXX year of  her age entered into that rest which remains  for the people of God'.   The children of Nathan and Mary (Bou-  ton) Warren are: t.

Constance Whitney, born in  New York City, January 17,' 1888; married,  December 19, 1912. at 924 Fifth avenue, New  York City, Conte Guy de Lasteyrie^ eldest son  of the Marquis de Lasteyrie, a descendant of  Several La Fayette, of revolutionary fame. 2.  George Henry, born at Newport, Rhode Is-  land, July 29, 18S9. Mr. George Henry War-  ren lives at 924 Fifth avenue. New York City,  and has a country place at Newport. Rhode  Island.     This family is of English de-  OGDEN scent and of great antiquity, it   being claimed that the name was  first written 'de Hoghton'. There is unmis-  takable evidence that families of this surname,  variously spelled, were located in different  parts of England as far back as the time of  William the Conqueror. One of the earliest  forms of the name was borne by Peter de  Hoton, who in 11 50 A. D. founded Erden or  Arden Priory, a Benedictine nunnery. John  de Hoton, in 1200 A. D., made certain grants  to the parish of Hoton, and was the father of  Sir John de Oketon, Knight of Rowcandura.  Other variations in the spelling of the name  have been Oketone. Okton, Ocktone, Okedone,  Okedon, Okeden, Oakden. Okden. and finally  Ogden ; this last form having first come into  use about the year 1500 A. D. The derivation  of the name seems to be from the Saxon  'ock'. oak-tree, and 'den' or 'dean', a wood-  ed valley ; the name is thus freely rendered  'oak dale' or 'oak valley', and on all of the  escutcheons of the arms-bearing Ogden fami-  lies of England the oak branches or leaves,  and acorns, are always found. The arms of  this branch of the family are: Sable, on a  fesse argent, between three acorns, or, as  many oak leaves vert. The crest also displays  the oak leaves and acorns. The motto is : Tan  que je puis.   (I) Robert Ogden. the earliest discoverable  English ancestor of the American family, is  first found upon record in the year 1453 when  he appears as a witness to a land grant in  Nutlev. Hampshire. He again appears in  1457 in connection with a post-niortcni search  concerning lands in Nutley belonging to one  Joan Ogden, of Ellingham, countv Southamp-  ton, who was presumably his wife. He had  two children: Richard, mentioned below;  William, married Agnes Hamlyn, and died  in T!;i7.   (II) Richard, son of Robert and Joan Og-  den, married Mabel, daughter of Johannes de  Hoogan, of Lyndhurst, Hants, prior to March  8 150'^. Children: John, married Margaret  Wharton ; William, mentioned below ; Robert,  who=e line became extinct in 1613.   (Ill') William, son of Richard and Mabel  (de Hoogan 1 Ogden. married.

Children : Edward, mentioned below ; Abi-  gail, married Philip Bennet ; Charles.   (IVj Edward, son of William and Abigail  (Goodsall) Ogden, was born at Bradley Plain,  September 6, 1540. He married there, De-  cember 16, 1563, Margaret, daughter of Rich-  ard and Margaret Wilson, her parents con-  firming to herself and her husband land in  Bradley Plain and Minstead.

(V) Richard (2), son of Edward and Mar-  garet (W^ilson) Ogden, was born at Bradley  Plain, May 15, 1568. Pie appears to have  lived in Wiltshire and had lands in New  Sarum and Plaitford. He married. May 2,  1592, Elizabeth, daughter of Samuel and Mar-  garet (Crane) Huntington, and sister of his  brother John's wife.

(VI) John Ogden, the pilgrim, son of  Richard (2) and Elizabeth (Huntington) Og-  den, was born at Bradley Plain, Hampshire,  England, September 19, 1609, where he mar-  ried. May 8, 1637, Jane, daughter of Jonathan  Bond. He prospered and acquired property ;  and three children, two of whom were twins,  were born to him in England. The name of  the vessel in which he sailed for .America is  not known, but it probably landed at South-  ampton, on the southern shore of Long Island,  early in 1640, as he is first mentioned as re-  siding here, where, on April 17, 1640, he re-  ceived a grant of land known as Shinnecock  Hill, adioining Southampton on the west. He  was a leader among the settlers in founding  the town. He later sold his 'housing and  home lot. etc.', in Southampton, to a cousin of  the same name in Rve, now Westchester coun-  ty. New York and in 1642 was of Stamford,     Connecticut. In this same year he entered  into a contract, in connection with his brother  Richard, with Governor Kicft, to build a stone  church in the fort at New Amsterdam; the  cost was to be two thousand five hundred  Dutch guilders, to be paid in cash, beaver,  skins, or merchandise. Harassing warfare  with the Indians retarded the work on the  structure, but it was completed in 1645. 'i'''s  was the first church erected in what is now  New York City, and stood for nearly a cen-  tury, having been destroyed by fire in 1741.   In 1644 the Dutch governor of the New  Netherlands granted to John Ogden and five  others a tract of land then known as the Great  Plains, extending from the sound to the south  shore and embracing a large portion of what  is now the boroi:gh of Queens, New York.  But the misgovernment of the Dutch and their  cruelty toward the Indians repelled John Og-  den, who was noted for his justice and hu-  manity, and he returned to eastern Long Is-  land to dwell again among his own country-  men. In 1647 he obtained permission of the  Southampton authorities to plant a colony of  six families at North Sea, on the Great Pe-  conic Bay, which afterwards was called North-  ampton. Here he established tJie whaling in-  dustry of Long Island, which remained until  the discovery of petroleum in T859, perhaps  the most important source of wealth and em-  ployment to the inhabitants. On March 31,  1650. he was made freeman of Southampton  by the general council, and in the same year  became a magistrate and town treasurer. His  written treaty with Wyandanch, sachem of  Paumanicke, or Long Island, and chief of the  Shinnecock Indians, is still preserved.   After residing upon Long Island for a pe-  riod of twenty-four years the earliest settlers  upon the eastern side of the island saw greater  possibilities of material advancement by trans-  ferring their interests to New Jersey. It is  oossible that they were strongly influenced by  home affiliations and blood relationships, the  Oldens, Cranes, and Bonds being all Hamp-  shire people, as was Sir Philip Carteret to  whom extensive grants in New Jersev were  made by the king. In the summer of 1664,  therefore, Tohn Ogden and his fellow colonists  visited what is now Elizabeth, New Jersey,  purchasing from the Indians their title to the  land, October 25 of the same year. A month  afterward a patent was granted them by the     360     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Duke of York for ' the parcell of land  Bounded on the South by a River commonly  called the Raritans River, on the East by ye  Sea wch partes Staten Island and tlie Main,  to Run Northwards up after cull Bay till you  come to the first River wch sets Westwards,  etc.'   John Ogden appears to have taken the lead-  ing position amonof the New Jersey settlers,  and in 1665 took the oath of sujiremacy upon  the restoration of Charles II. According to  family tradition he named the town in honor  of his mother, Elizabeth Huntington ; other  tradition is that it was named in honor of  Lady Elizabeth, wife of Sir George Carteret.  Governor Carteret constituted the Ogden set-  tlement the seat of his colonial government,  anfi in October, 1665, appointed John Ogden  a justice of the peace ; a month later he was  appointed member of the governor's council  and deputy governor, other honors following.  He was one of the commissioners who ne-  gotiated with the Massachusetts Bay Colony  in regard to purchasing part of the Elizabeth  town patent, and was also one of the com-  missioners who adjusted the boundary line be-  tween Elizabeth and Newark. When New  York was retaken by the Dutch in 1673, the  ofificial position of John Ogden was not dis-  turbed although Carteret was overthrown. By  commission dated September i. 1673. the  Dutch generals and council of war appointed  him Schout. or Burgomaster, of Elizabeth,  Newark, Shrewsbury, and other settlements  in New Jersey, and this constituted him vir-  tually p'ovcrnor of New Jersey. He was a  man of more than ordinarv mark, a true  patriot and a trenuine Christian. He died at  Elizabeth in Mav. 1682.   Little is known concerning his wife, Jane  Bond, except that she was the daughter of  Jonathan Bond of England ; she was very  probnb'v a sister of Robert Bond, her hus-  band's intimate associate both at Southampton  and Elizabeth. In his will by which she was  made administratrix of his estate, John Og-  den refers to her as his 'Deare and beloved  wife and ^oe hath been for above fowertv  yeares'. Children: i. John, born in Eng-  land. ATardi ■^ t6^8. died November 24. 1702;  married Elizabeth Plum. 2.

Benjamin, born in  America about 1654, died' November 20, 1722,  in his sixty-ninth year; married Hannah  Woodrufif. 6. Mary, born in America; mar-  ried John Woodruff the second.   (VJI) Jonathan, son of John and Jane  (Bond) Ogden, and twin brother of David,  was born in England, January 11, 1639, died  January 3, 1732, aged ninety-tiirce years. The  only mention of his name in the Southampton  records bears date October 21, 1664. when he  was witness to a deed. The following year  he removed with the family to New Jersey,  settling at Elizabethtown, and was one of the  original associates. On February 19, 1665, he  took oath of allegiance to Charles II., and was  then called one of the '5 full grown boys' of  Good Old John Ogden. Probably in Decem-  ber. 1667, he joined with others in petitioning  the governor and council to have their lands  laid out to them according to agreement made  with the inhabitants; in 1673 he took the oath  of allegiance to the Dutch government of New  York; in 1676 he applied to the surveyor-gen-  eral, or his deputy, asking that one hundred  and twenty acres of land be laid out to him ;  and on November 10, 1678, a considerable  amount of land was granted him by Philip  Carteret, governor, in the name of Sir George  Carteret, all of which, as well as his house  lot, receives clear and minute description. He  was appointed overseer of his father's will on  November 21. 1681. In 1692 he was receiver  of taxes for Essex county. New Jersey. In  1693 he was one of the petitioners to the En.g-  lish king concernine grievances under the gov-  ernment in the colonies. He was a zealous  churchman, contributing in 1678 and later, in  connection with his brother John, to the min-  ister's support ; and in 1691 he is called Deacon  Jonathan 0?flen, being named as one of the  largest contributors to the support of the  church. On December 26, 1690. he assisted  John Harriman, who had been chosen survey-  or, in assiening their respective shares to the  pronertv holders of Elizabethtown, and on sev-  eral occasions joined with others in the forcible  administration of the too frequently delayed  iustice in the colonies. Hi« will was probated  Tanuary 0, t7'^2, six davs after his death, and  he was buried at Elizabeth.   His wife, Rebekah, whose maiden name was     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     :6i     probably Wood, was born in November, 1648,  died September 11, 1723. Children: i. Jon-  athan, mentioned below. 2. Samuel, born  167S, died 1715; married (first) Rachel Gard-  iner, (second) Johannah Schellinx. 3.

(VHI) Jonathan (2), son of Jonathan (i)  and Rebekah (Wood?) Ogden, was born  about 1676. died before June 10, 1731. He  was a resident of Elizabethtown, occupying a  house which had been owned by his father.  When he had about attained his majority,  probably in 1696, he is named as one of the  many who petitioned the king for greater pro-  tection from the east Jersey proprietors. In  1701, also, he was one of the petitioners to  the king asking to be taken under his direct  government, should the proprietors not ap-  point a suitable person as governor, and like  his father was personally active in the attempt  to remedy the feeble administration of justice  by the authorities. Of the parentage of his  wife, Elizabeth, nothing is known. Children:  I. Jonathan, of whom all that is known is that  he married and had children, among whom  was a son of the same name. 2. John, men-  tioned below.   (IX) John (2), son of Jonathan (2) and  Elizabeth Ogden, was born November 22,  1700. died November 15, 1780. It is stated  in 'Hatfield's History of Elizabeth' that he  resided in a neighborhood about two miles  from Elizabethtown, New Jersey, called Sod-  om, and because of his singular piety was  familiarly called 'Righteotis Lot'. In his will  he left a considerable amount of silver and  other heirlooms to his children, and insured  to the wife of his son John a home in the  family as long as she should remain a widow.  He and his wife were buried in the First  Presbyterian churchyard at Elizabeth, New  Jersey. Pie married, October 8, 1722, Mary  Osborn, born 1705, died Anril 15. 1758. The  marriage is recorded at Easthampton, Lon?  Island, and agrees with the record in the old  family Bible which probably belonged to John  Ogden, the pilcrim, and which is now in the  possession of Mrs. Cortland Drake, of Mend-  ham, New Jersey.

Dr. Joseph Meeker Ogden. son  of Ezekiel ( 2^ and Abieail (Ogden) Ogden,  was born at Elizabeth, New Jcrsev, Septem-  ber 21. T804, died at Chatham, New Jersey,  February 13, 1884. He was graduated from     362     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Princeton in 1824, and entering the Presby-  terian ministry, was installed first pastor of  the Presbyterian church at Chatham, New  Jersey, in November, 1828. This church was  organized October 23, 1823, and the Rev. Asa  Lyman, of Morristown. New Jersey, became  its stated supjily. His health having failed he  was compelled to resign his labors in 1827,  when the congregation called the Rev. Dr.  Ogden to become their settled pastor. The  original house of worship soon became inade-  quate to accommodate the growing congrega-  tion, and a new church was erected in 1832.  This building was subsequently enlarged and  beautified, and the efficient labors of the pas-  tor and the growing regard of the people re-  sulted in a ereatly increased congregation.  Rev. Joseph M. Ogden was not only popular  in his own church and community, but became  well known and appreciated throughout the  state and officiated upon many occasions out-  side of his own pastorate. He resigned the  church at Chatham on September 23, 1873,  having enjoyed an uninterrupted and success-  ful pastorate of forty-five years. He and his  wife were both interred in the burying ground  at Chatham. Dr. Ogden married, in 1849.  Emeline Atwood. daughter of Richard and  Hannah (Hayes) Sweasey. She was born at  Newark, New Jersey, April 26, 1822, died at  Chatham. August 17, iSgo. Children: 1.  W'illiam Wilberforce, born March, 1850; mar-  ried Mariana or Marana N. Jarman. 2. Cor-  nelia Townley, born August 16, 185 1 : mar-  ried Francis L. Minton. 3. Joseph Wallace,  mentioned below. 4. Edward Prime, born  July T5. 1853, died February 2, i8f)g; married  Sarah Minton. 5. Henry Day, married Mary  Freeman.   (XHI) Joseph Wallace, son of Rev. Joseph  Meeker and Emeline Atwood (Sweasey) Og-  den, was born at Chatham, New Jersey, in  April, 1853. He received his middle name in  honor of Mr. William C. Wallace, the life-  long friend and parishioner of his father, born  the same year and graduated in the same class  at college. Dr. Ogden desired a liberal edu-  cation for his son and entered him at Lafay-  ette College in the class of '72 ; though he did  not remain to tlie end of the course and was  not graduated with his class, he later on re-  ceived the degree of A.M. from the college.  Upon entering business life his first occupa-  tion was that of clerk in a brokerage firm on     Wall street. His advancement was rapid, and  in 1 88 1 he established the banking and brok-  erage firm of J. \\\ Ogden & Company, which  he conducted with marked success for many  years. The house engaged in many large  financial transactions and acquired a well mer-  ited reputation for business sagacity and for  safe and conservative methods. Mr. Ogden  has become one of the prominent and influen-  tial figures in financial circles in New York  City, and has been connected in various ways  for a number of years with many leading cor-  porations and industries. For several years  prior to its absorption by the Erie railroad, he  was vice-president and director of the New  York, Susquehanna & Western railroad ; at a  later period he acquired extensive interests in  the anthracite coal fields, becoming president  of the .Algonquin and Laurel Run Coal com-  panies of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. He is  a member of the Union, Down Town, and Rid-  ing clubs of New York, and of the Morris-  town Coif and Whippany River clubs.   Mr. Ogden is not prominent as a politician  and has never desired political office. He is  a staunch Presbyterian and has been liberal  in the support of the church. In July, 1902,  when members of the church at Chatham of  which his father had been pastor for forty-  five years, opened a subscription for building  a new church, Mr. O.gden requested the with-  drawal of subscriptions to the amount of six  thousand dollars which had been received  from others, and himself contributed $10,000  to the cost of tlie building. The descendants  of Mr. William C. Wallace, his father's old  friend and classmate, requested that they  might be permittefl to provide the funds for  the interior decoration. The proposition was  accepted by Mr. O.gden. and the trustees de-  cided to change the name of the church to  the Ogden Memorial. Mr. Ogden is a resi-  dent of Morristown, New Jersey, where he  owns a handsome estate, Loantaka Farms,  upon which he passes a portion of the year;  this propertv has been in possession of various  members of the family since early colonial  davs. In the vear 1884 Mr. Ogden married  Charlotte Ward.   There is a movement on foot to erect a  monument in P>ow!inEr Green, New York City,  to the memory of John Ogden. at the tercen-  tenary of the city's settlement. He was the  earliest settler of pure English blood in New  York.     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     3C'3     The earliest Englishman who  HALSEY bore the name of Halsey, as  far as the available records  show, lived in the extreme western, end of  Cornwall between Penzance and Land's End.  We are told that in the time of Richard L,  who was crowned in 1189, and of King John  and his successor, the estate of the Cornish  family comprised 'the Lands of the family  surnamed de Als, now Hals, so called from  the Barton and dismantled manor of Als, now  Alse and Alesa, in Buryan'. The Norman  preposition seems to point to some Norman  origin. The word itself is more likely a pure-  ly Saxon one. dating from the invasions of  the fifth century or Danish, and thus was  brought over by the Vikings four centuries  before the Norman conquest. In Holland the  name existed and Franz Hals, the painter,  gave it renown. As a common noun and verb  the word was used from early times by the  English, and signifies in one case the neck and  in the other to embrace. The Halseys of  America are descended from Thomas Halsey,  of Hertfordshire, England, and Southampton,  Lonsr Island, and go back to John Halsey, of  the Parsonage. Great Gaddesden. mentioned  as father of William Halsey, als Chamber, in  grant of Rectory. March 20. 1520.   (I) Thomas Halsev, the immigrant ances-  tor of the Halsey family in America, was born  January 2. 1592. He was a mercer of Lon-  don, and was living at Nanles, August to,  1621, and at Lynn, Massachusetts, in 1637.  He was the owner of a hundred acres of  land in Lynn : was one of the founders of  the town of Southampton, Long Island. 1640.  the first English town in the state of New  York. He was a deleeate to the general court  at Hartford. Connecticut, in 1664; joined in  remonstrance. February 15. 1670, and was  named November i, 1676, in the patent of  confirmation. He was also named in Gov-  ernor Dongan's patent. December 6. 1686. He  lived Mav 4. 1657. probably on Horse Mill  Lane, which ran from Main street to the  Town Pond. In a list found in the town  records of iS'^? of inhabitants livine on the  west side of Main street, commencing at the  North End he is described as living in the  eiorhth hor=e .so'th of I=aac. His will, dated  Tulv 2R. t677. is orinted in the introduction  and is recorded in the Book of ^^'■ills A. New  York Countv. He married (first) before     1627. a woman of the baptismal name of  Phoebe, who was murdered by two Pequot  Indians in 1649. He married (second) July  25, 1660, Ann Johnes, widow of Edward  Johnes. Children : Thomas, born probably  1627; Isaac, mentioned below; Daniel, 1630;  Elizabeth, married Richard Howell.   (II) Isaac, second son of Thomas and  Phoebe Halsey. was born probably in 1628-29,  died in 1725. In a list of the inhabitants of  Southampton in 1698 Isaac appears with sev-  eral other Halseys. He was named as a trus-  tee of Southampton, December 6, 1686, in the  Dongan patent. He lived on the west side of  Main street, near the North End, and there is  a record showing him alive in 171 2. A broken  =tonc in the graveyard at Southampton says :  'Isaac Halsey died January 31, 172.5;.' It was  probably the grave of this Isaac. He married  a woman whose Christian name was Mary, but  whose maiden surname is unknown.

Excerpt from 'The Story of the Bronx,  1639-1912,' by Stephen Jenkins, published by  Putnam & Sons:   A short distance this side of the Bridge by which  the Boston Road crosses the Hutchinson River, a  pleasant road leads down to the right to 'Inver-  mere' known in ancient days as Hunts Landing.  There is a famous strawberry farm on this road a  short distance from the post-road. A few hundred  rods above Rattlesnake Brook, the White Plains  Road, now called Columbus Ave., branches off to the  left and passes by the ancient green in front of old  St. Pauls, its route being over the old Boston Road  of 1673 for some distance. As it sweeps down the  hill, it passes a gateway guarded by quaint and im-  posing white posts. This is the entrance to the  Halsey place, which was the executive mansion of  President John Adams, in October and November,  1797. several of his letters being dated from 'East-  chester.'l During that year. Philadelphia, the fed-  eral capital, was visited by yellow fever, and Adams  took up his residence in the Halsey House, then  occupied by his daughter Abigail and her hsuband,  Col. \Vm. Smith. During the Revolution, the com-  munion service, the P.ililc and other valuables pre-  sented to St. Pauls Church by Queen Anne, were  buried upon this property and dug up after the war;  this was to prevent them from being looted by the  British, who used the church about half a mile  above the hospital and who frequently occupied this  section in force, so that it thus became the scene of  manv a raid and warlike encounter. At the time of  the Revolution, this house was occupied by the Vin-  cents, the Smith of the village of Eastchester.     The Brink family of America,  BRINK except those who have come with   the recent Holland emigration  since 1846, is descended from Lambert Huy-  bertse Brink, who arrived in New Amsterdam  from Wagening (Wageningen), in the Neth-     366     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     eriands, in 1659. Wageningcn is a town on  the right bank of the Rhine in Gelderland.  It is about twelve miles from Arnhem. It  contains the state agricultural college and the  school for printing. The Brink family is very  numerous in the Netherlands. The name is  found in various forms, as van den Brink (of  the Brink) ; van Brink (of Brink) ; Ten Brink  (the Brink) ; Brinkhuis (Brink house) ; Brink  horst (Brink grove) ; Brinkenberg (Mount  Brink) ; Brinkerhoff (a paved square) ; Dol-  dcrbrink (valley Brink). The word Brink  means park, square or villjige green. The  arms of the family are thus described:  'd'argent au boeuf de gueules, corne d'or,  march ant sur une terrassede sinople. Bourlet  et lambrequens d'argent et de gueules. Cinier :  une corbeille d'or en sortent des flamines de  feu.'   (I) Lambert Huybertse Brink, immigrant an-  cestor of the Brink family, arrived in New Am-  sterdam. December, 1659, with the 'Geclove'  (Faith). The entry upon the ship's books is  'Lambert Huybertsen from Wagening (Wag-  cningen). wife and two children.' To these  must be added a son, Cornelis. born on the voy-  age.

He  was one of the protesting burghers at what  Governor Nichols called 'the mutiny of the  Esopus' in 1667 and one of the inhabitants of  the Esopus, who petitioned Governor Sir Ed-  mund Andros in 1680 that a minister be sent  there. His wife and children were captured  at the burning of Hurley by the Indians, June  7, 1663, and held in captivity three months;  and he served as a soldier in Captain Henry  Pawling's company in 1670.

This surname is simply  MONTANYE Montague written phonet-  ically, that is according to  the way French names so written are pro-  nounced in English. The name is Norman-  French in origin, having been formerly De  la Montague, showing it to have been origi-  nally borne by a family whose name had been  derived simply from their proximity to a  mountain. The derivation of names from  places and their peculiarities was common  among the French, particularly among the  well-to-do classes. In America the prefixes  'De la' have commonly been regarded as en-  cumbrances and been dropped, though they  have been retained in some cases.   (I) Dr. Jean or Tohannes De la Montague,  said to be son of Maison de la Montague, of  Haugesedoc, France, the immigrant ancestor  and founder of the American family bearing  the name, was born in i,'596 in Saintes, Prov-  ince Santonge, France, and studied medicine  at the University of Levden. He died in  Kingston, Ulster county. New York, in 1670.  While at Leyden he boarded with his broth-  ers at the house of Isaac de Forrest, who  orsranizcd the first settlement of New York in  1623. The parents of Jean de la Montague  are thought to have belonged to the aristo-  cratic class in France, residing in what is  now the department of Charente Tmpcrieure,  a province in the western part of France, in  the vicinitv of the Bay of Biscay. The in-  structor of De la Montague was the learned     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     369     Heurnius, and he was registered at the uni-  versity as a student, November 19, 1619, in  the Latin style as Johannes Marcerius Mon-  tanus. He was called Dr. Johannes La Mon-  tague, a Santo, that is of the province of San-  tonge. When de Forrest organized the first  settlement of New York in 1623 Montagne  was thought to be with him. De Forrest died a  few years after and his widow and children  returned to Leyden. Montagne married their  daughter Rachel in Leyden, November 27,  1626, and came to New York in 1637. He  was councilor for New Netherlands from  1638 to 1656. Montagne was a welcome and  valuable addition to the colonies, and proving  skillful in his profession, he soon rose in pub-  lic favor. He was commander at Manhattan  Island from 1640 to 1645, '''d was sent to the  defense of Fort Good Hope in 1641. He  was a member of Stuyvesant's council from  1647 to 1656, and from 1656 to 1664 he was  vice-director of Fort Orange. Two other of-  fices held by him were as member of the con-  vention of 1653 and commissioner of fortifi-  cations in 1654. At the death of his first wife,  Rachel de Forrest, he married the widow,  Agnes Stam, in 1647. The children of Jean  and Rachel (de Forrest') de la Montagne  were: i.

(H) John, third son of Dr. Jean and Rachel  (de Forrest) De la Montagne. was born at  Leyden in 1632, died at New York, or New  Amsterdam, as the city was then called, in  1672. In the records he first appears as Jean  Monier de la Montagne, Junior, later as Jan  La Montasfne, Junior. He early joined the  church in New Amsterdam, where in 1652 he  taught school for a few months under an ap-  pointment from the directors in Holland.  Some time after this he was made commis-  sioner of accounts, a position which he held  for about a vear. Entering into a partnership  in trade with Vincent Pike in 1634, he sailed  for Holland, and returning alone to this coun-  try in 1655 he bought a residence and ar-  ransfed for the coming of his wife from Hol-  land, where he had made her acquaintance     during his trip. On the institution of the bur-  gher right John's name was the first enrolled  on the list of Great Burghers, April 10, 1657.  That year he was a farmer of the retail ex-  cise, and was made fire warden, December 23,  1658. He removed to Harlem in 1660, being  chosen deacon, and he was busy there during  the next winter, when he 'bought a horse  with a saddle and bridle for three hundred  guilders in good strong current wampum.'  During the latter part of his life he served  as schout, secretary and vorleser. He acquired  the property known as the Point, before  granted to his father, but he left the village  two years after, getting permission to build  there. While in Holland he married (first)  Peternella Pike, daughter of Vincent Pike, his  trading partner, and (second) Maria, daugh-  ter of Isaac Vermilye, June 10, 1663. His  children were: i.

He first lived in New street, Harlem,  being church member afterwards at 'Scla-  vonia, in the Bowery division of the Out  Ward.' He seems to have been a brickmaker  by occupation, but among other offices held by  him he was constable in 1695. Fourteen years  later his domestic happiness was interrupted  by the wiles of one Cordaz, a neighbor brick-  maker, who, having been tried and found  guilty, was fined by the court of sessions. Vin-  cent left the city, but it is thought he returned,  but there is no record of his death. He mar-  ried, in 1684, Adriana. daughter of Jan  Tho'masz Aken, by whom he had nine children.

He was fifty-two years old when he  died, but Dr. O'Callaghan, misled in his ''His-  tory of New Netherland'' by those who con-  founded the two Vincents among the Mon-  tanyes, makes the later Vincent a hundred  and sixteen years old, the 'connecting link  between Stuyvcsant and Washington.'

It is  Gaelic and signifies 'red-haired,' and as such  it has often been used as a sobriquet down  almost to our own times in the Gaelic-speaking  parts of Ireland and Britain in conjunction  with or to supersede a family name. 'Burke's  Heraldry' gives three families of the name  who have the right to bear arms. The arms  of the Roy family of Scotland are: Azure a  lion rampant, argent on a border of the sec-  ond eight torteaux. Crest : A lymphad, her  sails furled and oars in action, in the sea  proper. Motto: Qua Tend is.   (I) Joseph Roy, the immigrant ancestor of  the Roy family in America here dealt with,  was born at Bolton. Lancashire. Eneland,  about the year 1817, died at Wappingers Falls,  Dutchess county. New York. September 26.  1900. He came to the United States in 1834  and settled at Pawtucket, Rhode Island, en-  ga.n'ing as a calico printer in one of the large  mills. In 1858 he went to Wappingers Falls,  Dutchess county. New York, and became head  of the denartment of calico printing with the  firm of Garner & Company. He remained  with this firm until his death. He married  Hannah F.. born at Manchester. England,  daughter of Richard Warren, an engraver in     that city. They had eleven children, among  them John H., mentioned below.   (II) John H., son of Joseph and Hannah  F. (Warren) Roy, was born July 26, 1864, at  Wappingers Falls, Dutchess county. New  York. He was educated in the district schools,  and in 1881 he became connected with the  Sweet, Orr Company of Newburg, Orange  county. New York, which has continued as  such for the past twenty-five years. In the  year 1887 he became credit man and manager  in the business, a position which he still re-  tains. He is a member of the Masonic order,  a member of the Newburg Historical Society,  and trustee of Washington's Headquarters,  Newburg, Orange county, New York. He  married, June 20, 1888, Cora J., daughter of  Thomas Harris, a prosperous farmer of Leo-  minster. Massachusetts. There has been one  son, Kenneth W.     The early settlers of the town  BLAKE of Montgomery, in Orange coun-  ty. New York, included many  Scotch-Irish families, such as Neeley. Eager,  Blake and Morris. They developed a fine  farming region, and were active in organiza-  tion of civil and religious affairs, and their  descendants in many cases are still resident  in the locality.   (I) John Blake appears in Montgomery in  the spring of 1761 and purchased. May i, of  that year, four hundred and seventy-seven  acres of land. This was probably in the east-  ern part of the town, where his descendants  were later found. He married Mary Morris,  of Coldenham, who was born in Northern  Ireland. John (2). son of John (i) and  Mary (Morris) Blake, was a prominent citi-  zen, active in the affairs of the county, mem-  ber of the state legislature and of the national  coneress, as well as filling other positions of  responsibility. The next mentioned was prob-  ably a son of John (1) and Mary Blake.   (II) Edward Blake, born about 1780. re-  sided in the eastern part of the town of Mont-  gomery. He married Chloc Belknap, prob-  ably a dauehter of Samuel and Mary C Gold-  smith) Belknap, of what is now the town of  Crawford, then Montgomery. They had eight  children, the last two, David A. and William  J. bein? twins.   (TTI) William T.. son of Edward and CMoe  (Belknap) Blake, was born July 22. 1817. in     37^     SOLTIIERN NEW YORK     Montgomery. He attended the country schools  adjacent to his home until fifteen years of age.  At that time he became a student of the Mont-  gomery Academy, and it is apparent tliat he  made most diligent use of his opportunities  for study. At the age of twenty years, in  18.^7, he entered the sophomore class of Union  College at Schenectady, from which he was  graduated in June, 1839. Following this he  acted as tutor for one year in the family of  a naval officer residing in the South. Return-  ing to his native town, he began the study of  law in September, 1840, with Charles Borland,  of Montgomery, and was admitted to practice  before the supreme court at Rochester in De-  cember, 1843. Soon after this, while on a  visit to Cold Spring, Putnam county. New  York, he was engaged to try some cases and  soon decided to settle there to engage in prac-  tice. In 1846 Governor Silas Wright ap-  pointed him a master and examiner in the  court of chancery. He was successful as an  attorney, but was compelled to abandon his  practice because of a defect in his hearing.  In the midst of his private practice and offi-  cial duties, during the year 184S, he gathered  considerable material pertaining to the history  of Putnam county, which was published in  1849. Closing his law office in April, 1850,  he spent the following year in the state of  Minnesota, returning to Orange county in  i8!;i. In the spring of 1852 he became as-  sociate editor of the Putnam County Courier,  and from that time forward until his death be  continued to reside at Carmel. In 1854 he  was appointed postmaster of that place and  held the position four years. Following this  he established the Piitnani Free Press, issuing  the first number, June 12, 18=58, This was  the first Republican paper in the county, and  Mr. Rlake continued its publication to Octo-  ber T7, t868. when he sold out. He again  became pr^'Uical and literary editor of the  paper, whi'-b had been purchased bv his fam-  ily, February 14, t88o, at which time the name  of the naper was changed to Putnam County  Repuhlican. Mr. Blake was an earnest stu-  dent and exercised a larp'e influence in the af-  fairs of Putnam coimty for many years.   He married Emmelinda. dautrhter of  Charles Minor, of Carmel. Their daughter,  Ida M. Rlake, was lonsr her father's companion  and aid in literary work. She became pro-  prietor and publisher of the Putnam County     Republican in 1880, and has continued as both  editor and publisher of that journal until the  present time. It is one of the most influential  papers published in the county and continues  to sustain Republican principles in politics.     Tuttle or Tuthill is a surname  TUTHILL borne by families in New   England for more than two  hundred and seventy years. The English sur-  names, whence the surname Tuttle is derived,  are Tothill or Tuthill, ancient family names  in England. These surnames are said to be  taken from names of old localities in England  and Wales. Tuttle, the American surname,  came to be generally adopted by the second  and third generations of descendants of the  immigrant settlers, although some branches  continue to this day to adhere to the English  form of the surname. The second syllable of  the English surname passed through every  possible change of spelling before it finally  settled into its present form 'tie.' A family  pedigree bearing the date of 1591 places at  its head William Totyl, of Devonshire, called  'Esq.,' who served as bailiff in 1528, and  again in 154S: was high sheriff in 1549, and  lord mayor of Exeter in 1552. As these offices  were only given to men of large estate and  high family connection, it may be inferred  that he was a man of social eminence. The  present agitation against race suicide would  have found in him an enthusiastic supporter,  as the pedigree above mentioned credits him  with being the father of thirty-six children,  but it is reasonable to assume, however, that  he wa:> married more than once, although his  only recorded marriage was to Elizabeth Matt-  hews, of Vorganwg, \\'^ales. The names of  twelve of his children appear in the records,  and it is quite probable that Elizabeth was  the mother of four of them, namely: Geoffrey,  John, Robert and Richard.   Four distinct families by the name of Tuttle  immigrated from England in 163=;. and three  of them arrived at Boston on the 'Planter,' in  the spring of that year. The heads of these  three families were: John, who settled in  Ipswich; Richard, who remained in Boston;  William, who went to New Haven. The fourth  was that of another John Tuttle, who em-  barked on the ill-fated 'Angel Gabriel,' which  was wrecked on the rocky coast of Maine, Au-     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     373     gust 15, 1634. This John Tuttle settled in  Dover, New Hampshire, prior to 1640, and  became the progenitor of a numerous poster-  ity. In the same year arrived another immi-  grant, whose descendants are numerous and  have been conspicuously identified with the  history of New York from a very early period  in its settlement to the present day. Many  prominent citizens of Orange county have  borne and now bear the name.   (I) The first of whom definite knowledge is  now obtainable was John Tuthill, who resided  at Sa.xlingham, England.   { II) Henry, son of John Tuthill, born 1580,  resided at Tharston, in the county of Nor-  folk, England, where he was buried March  26, 1618, in the churchyard of St. Mary's  church. His will was made six days before  his death. He married Alice Gooch, and the  baptisms of their children are recorded in St.  Mary's register: John, William, Henry, Alice,  Elizabeth. It is a natural supposition that the  John and William Tuthill, who founded fam-  ilies in this country, were of this family.   (HI) Henry (2), third child of Henry  fi) and Alice (Gooch) Tuthill, was baptized  June 28, 1612, at Tharston. He married in  England, Bridget, who accompanied him to  America in 1635. In that year he settled in  Hingham, Massachusetts, where he had a  planting lot at Broad Cove and a house lot in   1637. He was admitted freeman in March,   1638, and served as constable in 1640. He sold  his property there June 20, 1644, and removed  to Southold, New York, where he died before  1650. His wife survived him and married  (second) William Wells, of Southold. Chil-  dren: John, Elizabeth, Nathaniel, Daniel.   (IV)' John (2). eldest child of Henry (2)  and Bridget Tuthill, was born July 16, 1635,  probably in Hingham, died October 12, 1717,  in Southold, where he was a large land holder.

He married (second) May  28, 1690. Sarah, probably the widow of  Thomas Young, and daughter of John Frost.  She died November 8, 1727, surviving him  more than ten years. Children : John, Eliz-  abeth, Henry, Hannah. Abigail. Dorothy. De-  liverance, Daniel, Nathaniel, Mary, all born  of the first wife.     (V) John (3), eldest child of John (2) and  Deliverance (King) Tuthill, was born Febru-  ary 14, 1658, in Southold, where he died No-  vember 21, 1754, in his ninety-seventh year.  He owned land in Southold, where he served  as justice of the peace, and was commissioner  to lay out the King's Highway, the first public  road from Brooklyn to Easthampton. From  1693 to 1698 he was a member of the pro-  vincial assembly of New York, and also served  as sheriff'. He married, about 1683, Mehitable  \\'ells, born 1666, died August 26, 1742. Chil-  dren : John, James, Mary, Joshua, Dorothy,  Daniel, Freegift, Hannah.   (VI) Freegift, fifth son of John (3) and  Mehitable (Wells) Tuthill, was born August  8. 1698, in Southold, died in September, 1765,  in Goshen, New York, at the age of sixty-  seven years. His will is on record in Albany.  He married, in June, 1727, Abigail Goldsmith  and had children : Abigail, Nathaniel, Joshua,  Freegift. All the sons were soldiers of the  revolution, and the last died in the service.  He learned the trade of tailor and was oc-  cupied at that for a few years in his native  town. In 1730 he purchased a tract of four  hundred acres in the wilderness near Goshen,  New York, and there settled and engaged in  agriculture. After a short time he erected  a substantial stone house, which was his home  until his death.   (VII) Nathaniel, eldest son of Freegift and  Abigail (Goldsmith) Tuthill, was born Jan-  uary 17, 1730. in Brookhaven, died Septem-  ber 6, 1803, in the town of Blooming Grove,  Orange county. New York. His farm com-  prised a part of the original homestead on  which he built a stone house.

Tuthill purchased the interest of  Mr. Johnson, and subsequently Mr. Seeley  sold to William Eager, and the business was  conducted for some years under the style of  Tuthills & Eager. The latter sold out in 1864  to his partners, and for three years the Tut-  hills continued the business alone. They con-  ducted a large mercantile and forwarding busi-  ness, and in 1867 John B. Tuthill sold his in-  terest and soon after purchased a farm, which  he operated two years. Selling this he pur-  chased another farm of one hundred and  thirty-three acres, to which he made subse-  quent additions and carried on a general farm-  ing and dairying business until he retired in  1901. He was a director of the Chester Bank,  and was always active in promoting the gen-  eral interests of the community. In 1874 he  built a handsome brick residence on an emi-  nence, commanding a fine view of the sur-  rounding region. Throughout his life Mr. Tut-  hill was identified with the Democratic  party, and was honored with various of-  fices, such as overseer of the poor and county  overseer of highways. He was very ac-  tive in the Presbyterian church, and was for  six vears a member of the board of education  in Chester.   He married (first) December 10. 1856,  Martha S., daughter of Francis and Elizabeth  (Seeley) Tuthill, born October 30. 1836, died  September 25, 1857. He married (second)  January 26, 1859, Jane, daughter of James  Durland, of Chester, born May 6. 1837, died  September 2-\. 1867. He married (third) Feb-  ruary 4, 1869. .Susan, daughter of John and  Mary Ann (Pilgrim) Fowler, of Monroe,  born November 10. 1835. .granddaughter of  John Fowler, who came from Scotland and  settled in Monroe. Children: i. Stella Azu-  bah. born Januarv 28, 1870; was educated at  the Chester school; married, January 29, 1901,  William W. Startup, born July 4, 1871. at  Ellenville, Ulster county. New York, and is  the head of the drv goods firm of Startup &  Ouackcnbush, of Middletown. 2. Sarah, horn  May W. 1871. died in infancv. 3. Hiram Bart-  lett. December 8. 1872; resides on the paternal  homestead in Chester: he married Nellie,  daughter of Nelson Durland. of Chester, and  ha<: a son. John Bartlett (2).   (X^ PTiram (2). .son of Hiram (i) and  Azubah (Seeley) Tuthill. was born in Erin,  Chemung county. New York, November 30.     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     375     I '337, and is now living in Chester,  •Orange county, New York. He received  his education in the district schools of Che-  mung county, and came to Chester when he  was sixteen years of age. At that time his  brothers were in business there, and he con-  nected himself with them for about a year,  and then went as a clerk into the Chester  Bank, where he remained for the following  thirteen years, after which he went to Elmira,  New York, and engaged in mercantile pur-  suits, but in 1869 he returned to Chester and  bought out his brothers and formed the part-  nership of Tuthill & Clark, general mer-  chandise, which continued until 1875, when he  bought out Mr. Clark's interest and conducted  the business alone until igoo, when he sold  out. During this time he had been a director  in the Chester National Bank, and upon re-  tiring from mercantile pursuits he was elected  president of the bank, a position he still holds.  He is a Republican in politics and a member  of the Presbyterian church of Chester. He  married, in 1869, Pauline, daughter of Icha-  bod and Katharine (Seeley) Conklin, who was  torn December 12, 1844, died March 15, 1903.  Her parents were old residents of Orange  county, and lived for some years at Elmira,  N. Y. Children: Joseph E., died aged ten  years ; Leddra W. C, born June 22, 1874, mar-  ried Alvira R. Andrews, of Chester. N. Y.   (XI) Hiram B., son of John Bartlett and  Susan (Fowler) Tuthill, was born on the Tut-  Tiill homestead in Chester township. Orange  county. New York, December 8, 1872, and is  now living in Chester. He received his educa-  tion in the district schools of Orange county  and in the Oaverack Institute on the Hudson,  from which he graduated with the class of  i8go. He then spent three years in Texas,  after which he returned to New York and en-  gaged in the milk and dairy business. Later  he assumed the management of his father's  farm, which he has continued until the pres-  ent time. He is a member of Standard Lodge,  No. 711. Free and Accepted Masons, of Mon-  roe. New York, a past master of the Chester  Grange, a trustee of the Presbyterian church  in Chester, and he has served one term as  democratic assessor for the town of Chester.  He married. May 25, 1898, Nellie, daughter of  Nelson and Phoebe ( Kellog) Durland. Child,  John Bartlett, born February 21, 1901.     This name, pronounced  VERMELLE by the Dutch and French  fairmoyla, means 'from  IVieule,' and is an ancient surname of Zee-  land and Flanders, whence it spread over the  Netherlands and France. The assumption  that the original form was Vermeulen is not  borne out by examination or etymology, al-  though the latter family became the more  numerous, and their name was frequently, by  the error of scribes and the indifference of  branches of the family, substituted for Ver-  meule. Adrian, of Vlissengen and America  (1665-1735) was well educated. He wrote  his name in a fine, legible hand without the  final 'n,' and it must be assumed that he  did this advisedly. That it has been care-  fully preserved in its present form for over  five hundred years seems certain. The  Romans, in introducing the mill to Northern  Europe, brought with them two words,  'mola,' a millstone, and 'molina,' a mill.  From the first came the French Flemish and  Old Dutch 'meule.' From 'molina' came  French 'moulin'; early Dutch 'meulen,'  late Dutch 'molen' ; Old High German  'mulin': Anglo-Saxon 'mylen.' (The  words denoting millstone, in later times,  came to be used by some of these races for  mill; so we have Middle English 'melle or  mulle,' Old Frisian 'mole,' Middle and  Modern High German 'muhle.') 'Meule'  still survives in France, and retains its orig-  inal meaning, 'millstone.'' It also survives  in certain place names in Flanders, such as  'Aleulestede,' (Mill-stone place) near  Ghent, and 'Meulebeke,' (Millstone Brook)  near Thielt. Just where Meule was is not  now clear. Unquestionably it was in Flem-  ish Zeeland and may have been identical  witli Meulcstcdc. In 1502. Jan, of Brughes,  acquired citizenship at AHissengen, and on  tlirough the sixteenth and seventeenth cen-  turies the family were skippers and mer-  chantmen, trading to Dutch, Flemish and  other ports. In 1639 Adrian was a skipper  of Aardenburg, near Brusfhes, and in 1676  Jan. of Hulster Ambacht (Manor), near  \'lissengen, was a soldier with Admiral Ban-  chert, fighting the French. Considering their  environment, religfion and calling, it may be  safely inferred that thev fought with the  water beggars under William the Silent.  In 1661 Cornelius Vermeule purchased     376     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     burgher rights at New Amsterdain, where  he had brought goods for sale, and where he  stated that his mother then lived. Although  various members of the family were at New  Amsterdam, those in the direct line appear  not to have remained continuously here, and  probably they were either traders in the  Dutch West India Company, or else they  returned to Holland after the English occu-  pation of New Amsterdam, coming again  to this country later on.   (I) Jan Cornelissen Vermeule (son of  Cornelius), resided in Vlissengen, or Flush-  ing, Holland, where he was elected an elder  of the Dutch church, May i, 1686, re-elected  May 6, 1690, and May 15, 1694. He was  evidently a well-to-do burgher. In 1695 he  purchased a pleasure garden from Catalina  Sauchard, widow of Moses Cateau. His sons  were Jan. Cornelius and Adrian.   (II) Adrian, son of Jan Cornelissen Ver-  meule, was born about 1665-68 in Holland,  and was educated with the ministry in view.  He joined the church in Vlissengen, Octo-  ber I, 16S6. His friend, the Rev. Guillaem  Bertholf, who married Adrian's cousin,  Martnintie Hendricx Vermeule Verwey.  was a famous evangelist and church organ-  izer, and was for many years the pastor at  Hackensack, New Jersey. In May, 1688,  he had a child baptized at the New Amster-  dam church. Bertholf returned to Holland  to be ordained at Middleburgh, and per-  suaded his friend, .'\drian Vermeule, to visit  this country. They arrived about 1694, and  Vermeule. being an educated man, was in-  duced to remain and accept the position of  voorleser and town clerk at New Harlem,  where he witnessed a document in 1699. He  served as town clerk and voorleser until  1708. Some of the New Harlem town docu-  ments are sealed with Adrian's private seal,  bearing the Vermeule coat-of-arms. In 1707  the church at Bergen, New Jersey, invited  him to settle there as teacher and voor-  leser, which he did, officiating for the first  time, February 8, 1708. In the absence of a  settled clergyman he conducted the religious  service, acting every Sunday morning at  Bergen and on alternate Sundavs in the  afternoon at Communipaw and Harsamus.  He was teacher, both secular and religious.  and on May it, 1708, laid the cornerstone  of a new stone building to accommodate the     secular school. This was first occupied in  its finished state, October 3, 1710. For his  services Adrian received a salary of about  six hundred florins per year, and from De-  cember, 1712, to April 28, 1717, he also kept  the journals of the deaconry, for which he  received an additional annual recompense of  twelve florins. He evidently had some con-  siderable private means in addition, how-  ever, and was not dependent upon his sal-  ary. He was a brother-in-law of Dirck Cad-  mus, of Pamrapaugh, and they remained  fast friends until Adrian's death. He died  in the latter part of 1735 or early part of  1736, and during his twenty-seven years of  service at Bergen seventy-nine members  were added to the church. He married, or  published the bans of some fifty couples,  stood at the side of sixty-nine death beds,  and comforted many of the ill and sorrow-  ing members of that early settlement. In  1735 he purchased a large tract of land at  Plainfield, New Jersey, on which his two  sons settled and where his descendants con-  tinued for several generations.   He married (first) May 30, 1690. at Vlis-  sengen. Holland, Dinah Swarts, who had  one child that died in infancy in 1692. The  death of his wife and child probably caused  the loss of health and need for diversion  which led to his visiting America with Dom-  inie Bertholf in 1694, for it was this, and not  permanent settlement, which he had in mind  when he came. He married (second), at  Bersren. July i, 1708, Christina Fredericks  Cadmus, horn at Bergen, and their three  children were born there, viz. : Frederick,  Mav 20, 1700: Teuntje. Anril 8, 1712; Cor-  nelius, mentioned below. The elder son died  unmarried July 13. 1706. He resided with  his brother on the plantation purchased by  their father at Plainfield.   (HI) Cornelius, junior son of Adrian and  Christina Fredericks (Cadmus') Vermeule.  was born April 2, 1716, at Bergen, died  March 15, 1784, at Plainfield. He was a  member of the provincial congress and  council of safety in 1775 at the outbreak of  the revolution. He was a devout man and  an elder of the Raritan Church, at \^an Vech-  tens Bridge, but also an active man of af-  fairs and an ardent patriot. His four sons  served in the militia during the revolu-  tionary war, and his first born, Adrian, no     SOUTHERN NEW -YORK     .Ml     doubt as a punishment for the father's patri-  otic activities, and to his great grief, was  captured by the British in January, 1777,  and died a prisoner in the Sugar house in  New York two months later. Washington  occasionally visited the homestead, and the  officers of one of his regiments were the  guests of Cornelius one entire winter. That  Washington and his officers were not un-  mindful of this experience is evidenced by  the fact that in 1799, when war with France  was threatened, the government purchased  a part of the Vermeule plantation for a per-  manent camp, and by the further fact that  in 1814 a grandson, Cornelius, was enter-  tained at Mount Vernon by Judge Wash-  ington (the General being then dead) and  has left an interesting account of his visit.  Cornelius prospered, his plantation grew to  full one thousand two hundred acres, and  was manned by a goodly company of slaves.   He married Mary Marcelis, born 1720,  died May i, 1766. Children: Adrian, born  February 21, 1741, died March 9, 1777; Gar-  rity, September 4, 1744, died August 27,  1764: Eder, January 4, 1748, died April 5,  1828: Frederick, February 8, 1751, died  March 13. 1830; Christine, November 4,  1754, died November 4, 1779; Cornelius,  mentioned below ; Dinah, September 25.  1759, died February 10, 1825. The last  named married Richard Field and died with-  out issue. The other daughters died unmar-  ried.   (IV) Captain Cornelius (2) Vermeule,  fourth son of Cornelius ( i ) and Mary ( Mar-  celis) Vermeule, was born June 30, 1757, at  Plainfield, died there October 11, 1823. He  remained upon the homestead plantation,  which he called 'Warren Plains' after Gen-  eral Joseph Warren, whom he greatly ad-  mired, and for whom he also named a .son.  He enlisted in the Somerset militia when  eighteen years old, became captain and won  the hand of his colonel's daughter. The reg-  iment fought at Monmouth, and its service  was most arduous during the war. A letter  from Colonel Dirck Middagh's daughter  says that for months her father was scarcely  at home at all. He spent a goodly fortune  in the cause of his country. Captain Cor-  nelius Vermeule remained with his company  until 1802, when he resigned after twenty-  seven years' service.     He married, February 14, 1781, Elizabeth,  daughter of Colonel Richard Middagh, born  1764, who died July 9, 1849. Children:  Richard Middagh, born January 27, 1783,  died February 8, 1861 ; Dinah, January 26,  1785, died October 17, 1867; Cornelius, Jan-  uary 27, 1787, died January 15, 1859; Mar-  garet, 1789, died December 17, 1856; Fred-  erick, 1791, died January 30, 1865; Isaac  Davis, mentioned below ; Judith Middagh,  September 30, 1795, died February 22, 1881 ;  John Marsellis, August 8, 1800, died March  15, 1833; Field, September, 1803, died Feb-  ruary 26, 1877; W^arren, March i, 1806, died  March 9, 1861. All of these married and left  issue except Frederick.   He gave all of his large family a liberal  education. Of his seven sons, four were  physicians. Drs. Richard M., Field and  Warren practiced in New York when the  Bowery was the fashionable quarter, and  Dr. John Marsellis in Plainfield. His son  Cornelius, for a time a professor at Rutgers  College (1814), was for many years pastor  of the Reformed church at Harlem, and an-  other, Frederick, was educated for the min-  istry, but his health failed. His daughter,  Judith M., a woman of much literar}-^ ability,  became the wife of Rev. Dr. James Phillips,  a professor at the University of North Car-  olina, and the mother of Rev. Charles Phil-  lips, also a professor there; Samuel Phillips,  a prominent lawyer of Wa.shington, D. C,  and solicitor of the court of claims, follow-  ing the civil war; and Cornelia Phillips  Spencer, a historian and poet who received  the degree of LL.D. an honor then unusual  for a woman. Judith M. Vermeule. after  her father's death, pleaded earnestly with  his executors for the release of his slaves in  New Jersey. Her pleas are .still extant, yet  thirty-five years later, in her old age, she  found herself, by environment and all nat-  ural ties, a Confederate, on the side of the  .south, although one son espoused the north-  ern cause. That through this unusual and  trying experience her thoughts went back  to her girlhood home at Plainfield is evi-  denced by some touchingly reminiscent letters  to her northern kin, from whom she was for  several vears cut off by the war. Captain  Cornelius Vermeule's other daughter, Mar-  garet married John Clarkson, and became  the mother of Dr. Cornelius Vermuele     378     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Clarkson, a prominent New York City phy-  sician, and Dr. Frederick V. Clarkson, who  also practised in New York. The foregoing  is certainly an unusual professional record  for a single family of children.   (V) Isaac Davis, fourth son of Captain  Cornelius (2) and Elizabeth (Middagh)  X'ermeule, was born at Warren Plains, Sep-  tember 7, 1793, died near by, at New Market,  December 7, 1822. He married, January 30,  1818, at Fieldville, New Jersey, Mary Field,  born December 8, 1796, daughter of Dennis  Field, and a sister of Judge John D. Field.  Her's was a prominent family of that part of  New Jersey. He set up his home near the  homestead, at Warren Plains, but died four  years afterward of typhoid fever. He is  described as a well educated, tall young  man. of striking appearance. Children:  Dennis Field, born December 29, 1818;  Adrian, mentioned below; Mary Elizabeth,  January 2, T823.   (y\) Adrian (2). second son of Isaac  Davis and Mary (Field) Vermeule. was born  October 13,1820, at New Market, New Jersey,  died May 15, 1903, at New Brunswick, New  Jersey. He was an architect and builder at  Plainfield and New Market. Later he pur-  chased a large and beautiful tract of land  known as Landing Farms, near New Bruns-  wick, and brought it to a high state of cultiva-  tion. It is still in the possession of the family.  He also carried on a coal and grain business at  New Brunswick, was a director of local  banks and corporations, and was charged  with the settlement of several estates. He  was long an elder in the Presbyterian  church of Bound Brook, and later in the  Second Reformed Church of New Bnms-  wick. He was a man of uncompromising  integrity, a wise coiuiselor, a genial friend  and neighbor, exercising much influence po-  litically, although never a candidate for pub-  lic office. The loss of his father while he  was an infant, rendered still worse by the  fact that but little of his grandfather's prop-  erty came to his mother, constituted a seri-  ous handicap to y\drian, but he overcame it  by perseverance, acquired a good education  before reaching manhood, and won the re-  spect and confidence of the community in  which he lived.   He married, June 3, 1852, at Six Mile Run.  New Jersey, Maria Veghte, born there April     6, 1825, daughter of Nicholas and Cornelia  (Beekman) Veghte, and connected with the  oldest Dutch stock of America. Children :  Georgiana, Dennis Field, Cornelius Clark-  son, mentioned below ; Cornelia, Adrian, all  of whom are still living. The daughters  and youngest son are unmarried. The eld-  est son married Amy Kline Field and has  children : Edyth and Roy Field.   (VII) Cornelius Clarkson, second son of  Adrian (2) and Maria (Veghte) Vermeule,  was born September 5, 1858, at New Bruns-  wick, New Jersey. He was fitted for college  at the Rutgers Preparatory School, follow-  ing which he spent four years as a student  in the engineering course at Rutgers Col-  lege, New Brunswick, graduating in June,  1878, with the degree of B. S. and receiving  the degree of C. E. for progress in his pro-  fession three years later. After graduation  he was immediately employed on the New  Jersey State Survey, of which he became  engineer in charge in 1879. This work he  completed with marked success in 1888. It  was pioneer work of its kind in this country,  and its successful organization and execu-  tion by so young a man as Mr. \'ermeule  then was, attracted much favorable com-  ment. He has continued with the state as  consulting engineer to the present time, and  has investigated and reported upon water  supply, water power, drainage, inland water  ways, the effect of forests upon streams, the  imjirovcment of harbors and other matters  referred to him, in a long series of valuable  official reports. He is widely known as an  authority in hydraulic and sanitary matters.  Since 1888 he has conducted an extensive  engineering practice, with an office in New  York City, operating throughout the New  luigland. Middle and Southern States, and  in Cuba, .\fter an arduous campaign in  Havana and Washington in 1908. he per-  suaded the government to rehabilitate im-  portant works of sanitation at Cienfuegos,  Cuba, which works had been seriously in-  terfered with by the insurrection and inter-  vention of two years before. He founded  York Clififs. a summer resort in Maine, in  1892. While leading an active, practical life,  Mr. Vermeule finds time for literary culture  and historic research. He is a public-spir-  ited supporter of all municipal, state and  national measures for sanitation or other     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     379     economic or social betterment. Pie is in-  dependent in politics. He resides at East  Orange, New Jersey, and is identified with  the Presbyterian church. He is a member  of the Century Club and the Holland Soci-  ety of New York, the New England Society  of Orange, the New Jersey Historical So-  ciety, the Newark Board of Trade, and the  American Water Works Association.   He married, June 7, 1888, in New York  City, Mary Caroline Carpenter, born in  NewGurg, New York, daughter of Colonel  Horatio and Alida Carpenter Reed. Colonel  Horatio Reed served through the civil war  with distinction, and became colonel of the  Fifth United States Artillery. At the close  of the war his regiment garrisoned Fortress  Monroe, when Jefferson Davis was in cus-  tody there, and between his and the Davis  family a mutual regard resulted. He was  subsequently a Pasha in the Egyptian army,  which position he was compelled to resign  on account of ill health. His children were :  Mary Caroline, mentioned above; Benjamin,  died young; William Warren. Children of  Cornelius C. Vermeule : Cornelius Clark-  son and Warren Carpenter. Both are now  engaged in preparation for college at Car-  taret Academy, Orange, New Jersey.     There appears to have been a  GRIFFIN large number of early settlers  in America bearing the name  of Grififin. Savage's 'Genealogical Diction-  ary' mentions seventeen emigrants of this  name who arrived in America between the  years of 1641 and 1700.   The ancestry of the Grififin family to  whom this sketch refers, can be traced to  Major Jasper Grififin, who was born in  Wales, in 1648. He settled first in Essex  county, Massachusetts, in 1670. and the rec-  ords show that in 1674 he was a resident of  Marblehead, Massachusetts, He brought  with him to America the Grififin coat-of-  arms, on which is inscribed the motto. Sem-  per parafns — 'Always ready', and in con-  sulting the biosranhies of several descend-  ants of Jasper Griffin it is a noteworthy fact  that the family motto has invariably been  lived up to.   In 1(^7=;. Jasper Grififin, with his wife and  three children, removed to Southold, Suffolk     county, Long island, where he acquired a  large tract of land. He was a farmer of con-  siderable importance and was appointed ma-  jor of the provincial militia troops. A street  in Southold still bears his name, and it was  here that he died, April 17, 1718.   Among the children of Jasper Griffin was  a son Edward, who was married at South-  old, and had children who settled near  White Plains, Westchester county, New  York. Among them was John Griffin, who  left numerous descendants. Of these,  Charles Griffin, who married Mary Brewer]  is the direct ancestor of George Griffin, the  principal subject of this review. The chil-  dren of Charles and Mary (Brewer) Griffin  were: Cornelius, Charles, William, Milton,  Nelson and Edward.   Milton Griffin, fourth son of Charles, was  born in Westchester county, New York,  July 13, 1812. In early manhood he moved  to Dutchess county, locating at New Ham-  burgh, New York. Here he operated and  owned the largest lime kilns along the Hud-  son river, distributing his products in his  own vessels to the various water markets.  He married Mary E., daughter of John and  Elizabeth De Groot, descendants of an old  French Huguenot family of Ulster county.  Mr. and Mrs. Milton Griffin were devout  Methodists, and contributed liberally to the  cost of building the Methodist Episcopal  church at New Hamburgh. In their family  were Austin, Maria, Jennie, Gertrude, Ma-  mie, Levi'is, Milton and George.   George, son of Milton and Mary E. (De  Groot) Griffin, was born at New Ham-  burgh, New York, in 1854, and died at his  home in Dutchess county. May 29. 1910.  After completing his studies at the public  schools he located on Staten Island, where  with Lewis St. John he was extensively en-  gaged in the shipbuilding business, in which  he achieved an unusual degree of success.  Mr. Griffin married, in 1880, at Staten Is-  land, Miss Catherine Wait, and the follow-  ing children were born : Mamie, who mar-  ried Austin B. Hitchcock, of the town of  Wappinger ; Eloise, married Jacob T. Tomp-  kins, of the town of Fishkill ; Bessie W.,  and George L.. all now living. In 1897  Mr. Griffin decided to retire from active bus-  iness life, and removed with his family to  his native county of Dutchess, where he     38o     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     engaged in the cultivation of a farm until  the close of his life as noted above.     It is not possible to state  HOLLISTER outright the derivation of  the family name of Hol-  listcr. There is a variety in the explanation,  none of which may be selected as the correct  one with certainty, but nevertheless they  do explain. One forms the name 'holly'  and 'terra', meaning a land where the holly-  tree abounds, and this is pointed out as a  fair reason, for in Somersetshire, England,  where such trees do grow abundantly, there  is a place called Hollister. On the other  hand, such a combination is a hybrid, yet  hybrids in names and words do exist and  not uncommonly, too. 'Holly' is an Eng-  lish word, while 'terra' is of the Latin. In  olden times the name was also written  'Holester', and that would indicate a deri-  vation from 'Holy', (Saxon 'Halig',) with  the other Saxon word 'steora', being the  common affix 'ster', a director, — hence  'Halig-steora', a Holy Guide. Correspond-  ing in sound with the word Hollister is  'holster', (Saxon 'Heolster'), a hiding  place, or recess. To go back several cen-  turies in the history of this family, fraught  with changes of pronunciation continuous-  ly, it is truly difficult to reach a decision.  We can only discuss the derivations of the  sounds in the same manner as we would  point out antecedent nationalities by gazing  upon a face.   The arms used by the Hollister family in  America are: Sable, between a greyhound  courant bendways and a dolphin, hauriant  in base, argent, three roses gules; on a chief  of the second, two slips of strawberry fruct-  ed proper. Crest: An arm in armor, em-  bowed between two sprigs of strawberry,  as in the arms, and holding a branch of holly,  proper. Motto : Fuiiiius, et sub Deo Eri-  miis. In a coat-of-arms owned by Hon.  Gideon H. Hollister, the armor is sable,  but striped or; the greyhound is argent, as  is the dolphin, except the back, tail and fins.  which are or. The crest rests on a wreath  of gules and argent.   The Hollister family is of Anglo-Saxon  stock, long settled in England. It cannot  be said that they were confined to any par-  ticular nart of the kingdom, but those of     whom there has been handed down a good  record lived in Gloucestershire, Somerset-  shire and Wiltshire.   The earliest mention of the name has been  found in the sixth year of Queen Elizabeth,  between November 17, 1563, and November  17, 1564. This entry in the English records  shows that Henry, Lord Berkeley, sold the  fourth part of his manor of Almondsbury,  Gloucestershire, to John Hollister and  others. There is a will on file, made by John  Hollister, a merchant of Bristol, of the same  name and almost the same period as of the  first of the name in America, dated July 29,  1575. The parish register of Stinchcombe,  Gloucestershire, in the year 1584. gives the  marriage of one and the burial of another  of the name, and it is almost certain that  the progenitor came from that parish.   (I) John Hollister is the ancestor of the  family in America. It is believed that he  was born in England in 1612, and to have  emigrated to this country about 1642. He  probably sailed from Bristol. It is certain  that he was educated and of good family,  for immediately upon arriving he became  one of the most prominent and influential  men of Wethersfield and the Connecticut col-  ony. His name first appears in the records  of that colony as a juror of the particular  court held March 2, 1642, which goes to es-  tablish the fact that he was a settler at that  time. He was admitted freeman in 1643;  was a deputy in 1644. again in April, 1645,  and represented the town of Wethersfield  many times thereafter until 1656. His name  appears as a juror in June, 1646. With  Thomas Coleman and Nathaniel Dickerson,  he was appointed for Wethersfield, October  3, 1654, to join with the deputy-governor  to press men at Wethersfield for an expedi-  tion, probably against the Indians, who were  then at war against the settlers of that  neighborhood. He was appointed by the  general court, in February, 1656, to give  'the best and safe advice to the Indians, if  they agreed to meet and should crave their  advice.' His name first appears on the  records as Lieutenant Hollister in March,  1658-59, when he applied to the general  court as to the charges of the church at  \\'ethersfield against him for which he had  been excommunicated. The quarrel is spread  upon the record as follows:     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     381     'By this time, the church at Wethersfield had  again become ripe for dissensions. Probably  within two years after the death of Mr, Smith,  but at what precise date is not known, the Rev.  John Russell was called and ordained there, so  far as appears, without opposition. The first part  of his ministry was quiet and seemed to promise  well for the future. But the Hartford controversy  gradually extended into the church and some  other elements of a very combustible character  were made to feed the flame. Among other  things, Mr. Russell appears to have been a wit-  ness in a lawsuit, and to have testified in a way  that was extremely animadverted upon by Lieu-  tenant John Hollister, a prominent member of  the church. Mr. Russell held the views with  Mr. Stone of Hartford in relation to church gov-  ernment and discipline, and without giving the  offending member an opportunity to have a hear-  ing, or even the benefit of a vote of the church,  he privately excommunicated him in 1656, and  afterward refused to give his reasons for such  summary proceeding when they were demanded  by Mr. Hollister. Had Mr. Russell been anxious  to test the practical workings of his plan of  church government, he could hardly have chosen  a more favorable subject than one of Captain  Mason's military officers, a gentleman of un-  doubted probity, and experienced member of the  general court and a man not likely to be out-  done by Mr. Russell in the steadiness of his  purposes and the obstinacy of his resistance. Be-  sides his own natural force of character, Hol-  lister had married a daughter of Richard Treat,  Esquire, one of the most formidable opponents  in the colony, and could bring into the quarrel an  arrav of names that the general court would  hardlv treat with contempt. The whole town  was of course tlirown into a state of excitement,  at this unusual war waged between a clergyman  against a member of his church. * * * The  quarrel ended with the removal of Mr. Russell  to Hadley, with his adherents, where he spent  the remainder of his days.'   Lieutenant Hollister was appointed col-  lector in Wethersfield. March 14. 1660. He  was a large land-holder there, especially in  the part of the town on the east side of the  Connecticut river, later on known as Glas-  tonbury. It was the first portion of the  town laid out by survey for the colony, and  was intended to give each occupant a fair  portion of meadow and upland. These were  called 'Naubuc Farms', and Lot 34, from  the Hartford line southward, was originally  set ofT for Matthew Mitchell, who removed  to Stamford. It contained about nine hun-  dred acres. One-third of this came into pos-  session of Lieutenant Holli.^.ter. and he also  acquired the next lot to the south, adjoin-  ing the Treat farm of his father-in-law. A  considerable portion of the land remained     in possession of the HoHister family until  as late as 1884, but when Charles Hollister  died it was sold. The house in which he  lived was built in 1675, ^i^^ was known as  'the old Red House', located on the west  shore of Roaring brook, facing the south,  on the road leading to Rocky-Hill ferry.  It is a large, commodious house, with an  upper story projecting over the lower by  a few inches, according to the architectural  style of colonial days. The finishing of the  'best room' is particularly handsome,  adorned with panels and moldings which  are unusually fine for a house built at that  time. The outside is ornamented by brack-  ets or corbels carved in the corner and door-  posts. The ancient well was covered over  about the year 1800, but in 1885 was once  more put into service.   Lieutenant John Hollister married Joan-  na, daughter of Hon. Richard Treat Sr., and  his wife Joanna. His death occurred at  Wethersfield, Connecticut. April. 1665; she  died in October, 1694. His will was drawn  April 3, 1665, and was probated June i.  [665. Children: i.

This controversy finally resulted in a re-  survey of all the 'lots', from the Hartford  line to Nayaug, by order of the general  court, and which has been preserved in the  state archives, which papers are most im-  portant to the place.

This name has been described  HICKS as being of Norman or Anglo-  Saxon origin, and some author-  ities state that it has been derived from a  village of the name in Gloucestershire, Eng-  land. The name is, however, frequently  found in Wales, where the Ap Hickses were  prominent for many centuries, and are of  Celtic origin. The earliest historical refer-  ence to the Hicks family is found in the rec-  ord of the knighting of Ellis Hicks on the  battle field of Poictiers, September 19, 1356,  by Edward, the Anglo-Norman Black  Prince, for distinguished bravery in captur-  ing a set of colors from the French, whose  force is said by English historians to have  outnumbered the English by five to one.   (I) Robert Hicks, immigrant ancestor of  the Hicks family in America, arrived in  Plymouth harbor, November 11, 1621, on the  ship 'Fortune'. He was a son of James,  of Southwark, London, and was lineally de-  scended from Sir Ellis Hicks. Robert's sec-  ond wife, Margaret Winslow. and her chil-  dren, followed him on the ship 'Ann', the  latter part of 1622. They settled in Dux-  bury, Massachusetts, where he did full duty     as a pioneer in developing the land and  building a home. He was a man of consid-  erable consequence in the community. The  'I-Iistory of Plymouth' states that he owned  considerable land in that town, and gives a  fac-simile of a deed made by him to Miles  Standish for the transfer of certain real es-  tate in Plymouth. The same history gives  the fac-simile of his will and that of Mar-  garet Winslow, his second wife, who was a  sister of Governor Winslow. Robert Hicks  took the oath of fidelity about 1644. He  married (first) Elizabeth Morgan ; and (sec-  ond') I\Targaret Winslow. Children by first  marriage: Elizabeth; Thomas; John, men-  tioned below; and Stephen.   (II) John, second son of Robert and Eliz-  abeth (Morgan) Hicks, was born in Eng-  land, and came to this country in 1630. He  was a graduate of Oxford University. He  remained a short time in Massachusetts with  his father, but in company with his brother  Stephen he migrated to Rhode Island, and  in 1639 he was in Newport, Rhode Island.  Still with his brother Stephen, he went to  Long Island about 1640, and settled at what  was subsequently Flushing. John was an  original proprietor of the town of Flushing,  as well as incorporator, October 10. 1645,  and of Hempstead in 1647. In 1645 Gover-  nor Kieft granted patent to Thomas Far-  rington, John Hicks and others, of the town  of Flushing. He was a member of the cele-  brated Hempstead convention. February 28,  1665. In 1664 he was a justice under com-  mission from Connecticut, the same year be-  ing also a deputy from Hempstead. His  name and the name of his son Thomas appear  in connection with almost every public  measure for years, and he was frequently  appointed to fill some of the most important  offices. He acquired considerable reputation  as a successful negotiator with the Indian  tribes of Long Island. He married (first)  Herodias Long, of England; Csecond') Ra-  chel Starr. Children: Thomas, mentioned  below; Hannah, and Elizabeth. There was  no issue bv the second marriage.   (III) Thomas, son of John and Herodias  (Long) Hicks, was born in 1640, probably  at wliat was later called Flushing, and died  in 1739. He was a man of considerable abil-  ity and seemed to have a liking for public  affairs, following the example of his father     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     in taking a prominent part in initiating and  promoting the advancement of the com-  munity. He was a large landowner and  engaged in farming, and also seems to have  been interested in numerous commercial en-  terprises. He was the first judge appointed  for the county of Queens, and was a lieuten-  ant-colonel of the Continental forces on  Long Island. In 1666 he obtained from  Governor Nichol a patent for four thousand  acres including Great Neck and adjacent  lands. Here he erected a fine mansion and  introduced the English manorial manner of  living. He married (first) Alary, daughter  of Richard Butler, of Stratford, Connecticut,  and widow of John Washburn; and (sec-  ond) Mary, daughter of Thomas Doughty.  Children, by first marriage: Thomas, and  Jacob, mentioned below ; by second mar-  riage : Isaac, William Stephen, John,  Charles, Benjamin, Phoebe, Charity, Mary.  Elizabeth.   (IV) Jacob, son of Thomas and Mary  (Butler) (Washburn) Hicks, was born at  Hempstead, Long Island, in 1669, and died  in 1755. He lived for some years at Rocka-  way, Long Island. He married Hannah,  daughter of Nathaniel Carpenter. Children :  Samuel. Stephen, Thomas, Joseph, Jacob,  Benjamin, Elizabeth, John, mentioned be-  low; Sarah, and Hannah.

(VII) Oliver Hewlett, son of Stephen and  Mary (Hewlett) Hicks, was born at New  York, June 30, 1781, and died there, of  cholera, September 17, 1832. He engaged  in business about 1800 and soon became  well known in commercial circles. He first  resided at 87 Maiden Lane, and his counting  house was at 88 South street. In 1819 he  was elected secretary of the Fulton Fire  Insurance Company, which office he held  until 1828. In 1830 he was elected president  of the Farmers' Fire Insurance and Loan  Company, now the Farmers' Loan and  Trust Company. He was president of the North  American Insurance Company. He lived at 34  Wall street, and in 1823 at 29 Wall street. In  1826 he moved to 540 Broadway, where until  the spring of 1832 he continued to reside, at  the end of which time he purchased a house at  415 Broome street. He owned a farm on  the old Bloomingdale road from 83d to io6th  street, where he lived in 1800 and where  afterwards his family spent their summers.  He gave the land on which St. Michael's  Church was built, and was one of the origi-  nal pew holders, occupying one of the two  large bo.x pews. He was a vestryman of  St. Michael's from 1807 to 1813, from 1813  to 1815 was a warden, and treasurer from  1810 to 1815. The early vestry meetings  were usually held at his house in Wall  street. On April t. 1823. he was elected a  vestryman of St. George's Church, and was  its senior warden for several years. He was  also a vestryman of St. Thomas' Church ;  his pew there was No. 138. He gained a  reputation by his production of a book 'The  Insurance .^djuster'. written in 1825 and  reprinted in several editions. The following  extract is from the Ad-rcrtiscr of September  17, 1832:   'It is with deep regret we announce the sud-  den decease of Oliver Hewlett Hicks, president  of the Farmers' Loan and Insurance Company.  Mr. Hicks has been in delicate and rather feeble  health for some time past, but was able to at-  tend to the laborious duties of his office. He  was able to attend church three times on Sunday,  and went to bed in the evening in better health  and spirits than usual. .Kt. throe o'clock yester-  day morning he was seized with cholera, and so  rapid was the disease that hi? feeble constitution  sunk rapidly and he expired at six o'clock last  evening. For the last forty years Mr. Hicks has     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     389     been one of the most active business men in  Wall street, and for a number of years has en-  joyed the confidence of the merchant community  in adjusting marine losses. No person was more  deservedly esteemed in private life, and in special  business in which he was engaged none had at-  tained a higher reputation. His loss to his af-  flicted family and numerous circle of friends is  irreparable. The death of so valuable a member  of society may be truly considered a public loss.'  He married, in 1800. Julia, daughter of  Samuel and Anne (Hubbard) Bush, of  Greenwich, Connecticut, where she was  born July 4, 1784. dying March 21, 1871.  Children : John Augustus, mentioned be-  low; Samuel Bush, born August 13, 1804;  Mary A., March 4, 1807; Charlotte A., De-  cember 10. 1809; Julia B., August 15, 1812;  Matilda, April s, 181 S: Oliver H., January  I, 1818: Maria B., March 18, 1821 ; William  H., January 30, 1824; Samuel B., May 3,  1827.   (Vni) John Augustus, son of Oliver  Hewlett and Julia (Bush) Hicks, was born  at No. 54 Wall street. New York, February  21, 1802, and died at Burlington, Vermont,  November 4, i86q. He was graduated from  Columbia College, New York, in 1823, and  from the General Theological Seminary in  1826. He was ordained deacon by the Right  Rev. John Henry Hobart, in Grace Church,  Jamaica, New York, August 22, 1826, and  became assistant to the Rev. Evans M.  Johnson in Jamaica and Brooklyn, and rec-  tor of Trinity Church, Easton, April i, 1827.  His ministry in Easton was very successful.  He was ordained to the priesthood by Bish-  op White of Pennsylvania, in Christ Church,  Philadelphia, May 28. 1828. In April, 1831,  he accepted a call to St. John's Church,  Troy, New York, and resigned in January,  1832, on being called to Rutland, Vermont.  He was rector of Rutland for twenty-eight  years, and the parish under his care became  one of the largest in Vermont. He received  the degree of D. D. both from the University  of Vermont and Middleburv College in 1847,  and also ad cuudcin from Trinitv College in  1849. The high esteem in which his char-  acter and services were held bv the clergy  and laity of the diocese is clearly shown by  the frequency with which they elected him  to the highest offices in their gift. He was  elected in 1836 a trustee of the newly or-  ganized Vermont Episcopal Institute. His  voice lost its power in i860, and he resigned     from his parish to accept the Willoughby  professorship in the Institute. As a preach-  er his style was clear, logical and terse, and  always clothed in classical English. He  preached last on Sunday, October 17, 1869,  in Milton, Vermont, and was taken ill on  his return Monday, and died on Wednesday,  November 4, 1869.

'I  There has licen much controversy among  those interested regarding the proper  orthography of the surname Cleveland. The  signature of Moses Cleveland, of Woburn,  Massachusetts, as a subscribing witness.  December 8, 1662, to a certificate, would  certainly indicate that the ancestor of the  Clcvelands of New England origin spelled  his own name Cleveland. On old \\'oburn  records the name is rendered Cleauland,     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     391     1648-82, 1692; Cleaveland, 1701 to 1704, and  Cleveland in 1702. In England from a very  early period the name has always been  spelled Cleveland, except in a few instances,  where it has been rendered Cleaveland or  Clevland. Certain branches and individuals  of the posterity of Moses Cleveland spell  the name Cleaveland. The name would seem  to be derived from Cleveland, North Riding,  Yorkshire, England, Thorkil de Cleveland  in 1066 being apparently the first to bear it.  (I) Moses or Moyses Cleveland or Cleave-  land, the common ancestor of the Cleve-  lands of New England origin, was prob-  ably born at Ipswich, England, about 1624,  and died at Woburn, January 9, 1701. He  came, it is thought, when a youth from  Ipswich, Suffolk county, England, and  sailed, according to a family tradition, from  London, arriving in America in 1635. He  first landed somewhere in Massachusetts,  probably either at Plymouth or at Boston.  John Cleveland wrote, in 1759: 'My great-  grandfatlier's name was Moses Cleveland,  and he came from Ipswich to Sufifolk, Eng-  land. He was young when he came to New  England, and was an apprentice to a joiner,  and came here with his master. He settled  in Woburn, near Boston, married, and had  seven sons.' He married, in Woburn, 1648,  Ann Winn. Children: Moses, born 1651;  Hannah, 1653; Aaron, mentioned below;  Samuel, 1657; Miriam, 1659; Joanna, 1661 ;  Edward, 1664; Josiah, 1666; Isaac, 1669;  Enoch, 1671.   (II) Aaron, son of Moses and Ann  (Winn) Cleveland, was born at Woburn,  Massachusetts, January 10, 1654, and died  at Woburn, September 14, 1716. He was a  soldier in the King Philip's war, as were also  his brothers Moses and Samuel. He was  made a freeman in 1680, and became prom-  inent in all affairs at Woburn. He was a  housewright by trade, though he also en-  gaged in farming and land speculating, be-  ing known as a man of distinction in the  town and wealthy. He married (first) at  Woburn, September 26, 1675, Dorcas,  daughter of John and Hannah (Jones) Wil-  son ; (second) Prudence .

(HI) Aaron (2), son of Aaron (i) and  Dorcas (Wilson) Cleveland, was born at  Woburn, Massachusetts, July 9, 1680, and  died in that part of Cambridge called Mys-  tic, now Medford, Massachusetts, in 1755.  He was a captain of militia, and lived in  Woburn till 1704, later in Medford and  Charlestown. He was admitted in 171 1 by  proof and baptism to Cambridge church,  and he was transferred in 1720 to Medford  church and received to communion in East  Haddam. He was a constable in 1717, an  office like that of a magistrate and con-  ferred usually on the best scholars and the  best men. lie kept a tavern at Cambridge,  on the western side of the Mystic river,  and was a builder and contractor. At East  Haddam he became prominent in the mil-  itary and was successively cornet, lieuten-  ant and captain.

(IV) Aaron (3), son of Aaron (2) and  Abigail (Waters) Cleveland, was born at  Charlestown, October 19, 1715, and died at  Philadelphia, Penn.sylvania, August II,  1757. He was a clergyman and a character  of considerable note. 'He entered Harvard  in 1731 and was graduated in 1733. He was  a large, powerful man, it is said, and excel-  lent in all exercises requiring strength and  agility. It is not known where he studied  theology. He probably preached his first  sermon at Medford. He was ordained min-  ister of the Strict Congregational Church,  Haddam Society, July. 17.W.

He was  one of the most prominent characters of the  Cleveland family. He was apprenticed to a  hatter at Haddam. While learning his trade  he devoted all his leisure to study, and when  nineteen wrote a poem that is still pub-  lished. He married (first) Abiah Hyde;  (second) Elizabeth Breed. Children:  George, mentioned below ; William, born  1770; Charles, 1772; Frank, 1774; Aaron,  1778; Lucy, 1787; Stephen, 1792; Jeremiah,  1794: Abiah Hyde, 1796.   (VI) George, son of Aaron (4) and Abiah  (Hyde) Cleveland, was born January 9,  1769, and died at Middlebur}^ Vermont,  February 2, 1851. He lived first at Nor-  wich, Connecticut, where he entered into  partnership with his father and commenced  the manufacture of hats. In one week their  manufactory was burned in a great fire.  George removed to Guilford, where he car-  ried on the business and resided there till  1808, when he gave up his business and  removed to Middlebury, \^ermont. There  he was a merchant and postmaster for  twenty years. He was appointed United  States tax collector and was elected member  of the Vermont legislature from Weybridge.  He married Catey Caldwell, born at Guil-  ford. August 29, 1776, daughter of Samuel  and Rachel (Ranna) Guilford.

Februarv 22, 1802,  and dicfl at Rurlineton, Vermont, November 4,  1869. son of Oliver Hewlett and Julia  (Bush) Hicks. (See Hicks).     John Reynolds (i), pro-   REYNOLDS genitor of this branch of   the family, is supposed to   have sailed from the port of London — i. e.,   Ipswich. England, in 1633. .Sarah Reynolds   (his wife), aged 20, was a passenger on the     ship 'Elizabeth,' which sailed from Ipswich  'bound for New England the last of April,  1634''   Among the passengers were many who set-  tled at \\'atertown, Massachusetts, and sub-  sequently removed to Weathersfield and Stam-  ford, Connecticut, but John Reynolds was not  among them. John Reynolds was admitted a  freeman of Watertown, May 6, 1635. Robert,  his brother, had been admitted Sejitember 3,  1634-   Sir Richard Saltonstall, together with a  body of Pilgrims or Separatists, had founded  Watertown, Massachusetts, where a church  was 'gathered'' under Phillips as pastor, Au-  gust 27, 1630. The latter came from Box-  ford, county Essex, and most of the colonists  were members of his former charge. Un-  fortunately, the records describing the settle-  ment of Watertown are not in existence, but  on pa.ge 4 of the earliest book of records is  the first entry in which the names of colonists  are mentioned: 'Nov. 14, 1635 — agreed that  Daniel Patrick, Brian Pemberton, Richard  Bernard, Ephraim Child, Abraham Browne,  Charles Chaddock and John Reynolds shall  divide to every man his Property and Meddow  and upland that is plowable ancl the rest to be  common.'   The first book of deeds entitled 'The W'a-  tertown Lands, Grants and Possessions,' page  157. and constituting the second inventory, de-  scribes his allotment as follows : 'John Rei-  nolds, An Homestall of five acres and half  by estimation bounded the North with the  Hi,ghway, the .South with Isaac Mixer and  the East with John Sherman granted to him '   Learning of the rich meadows along the  Connecticut river, some few of the Water-  town colonists, in the late autumn of 1634,  founded the settlement of 'Pyquag,' now  Wethersficld. and spent the winter there. On  May 29th of the vear following, six persons  (among them Robert Reynolds) under the  head of Rev. Richard Denton, who had re-  ceived their dismissal from the Watertown  church March 29th of that year, set out to  'form a newe in a church covenant in the  River of Connecticut' (Coim. Col. Records,  p. tL   On October isfh. T'135. about sixty colon-  ists set out from Watertown to the new set-  tlement. Such was the general distress that  many of tlicm returned in December, but in     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     393     the early spring of 1636 once more repaired  to 'Watertown on the Connecticut River.' It  was not until Feb. 21, 1637, that the settle-  ment received the name of Wethersfield. The  colonists were continually exposed to danger  from the Pequots. In April, 1637, they way-  laid the settlers as they were going into their  fields and killed six men and three women.  On May 26, 1637, the Wethersfield men, unit-  ing with those from Windsor and Hartford  and with seventy Mohegans under their  sachem, Uncas, attacked the Pequots, burnt  seventy wigwams and killed five or six hun-  dred of the enemy. (See Trumbull, vol. i.,  chap. V.)   Both John and Robert were among those  who removed from ^^^atertown prior to July  2i^, 1636, as they did not share in that divi-  sion of land. As stated above, John still  owned property in Watertown at the time of  the second inventory, i. e., 1644. Robert Feke,  Brian Pemberton and Daniel Patrick are also  included, although all of them had removed to  Wethersfield and Stamford.   Robert removed from Wethersfield to Bos-  ton, where he died April 27, 1650. His will,  executed 20, 2, 1658, proved in Boston, July  27, 1650, gives the names of Marv, his wife,  and children : Nathaniel, Ruth Whitney, Ta-  bitha Abdy. Sarah Mason, and Mary Sanger.  His will concludes with the statement, 'I and  my wife being stricken in ace and are almost  past our Labour.' From this we must con-  clude that he was born about i.SQO, and was  either much older than his brother John, or  that the latter was born earlier than 1612.  the date of birth attributed to him. (See  New Eng. His. & Gen. Reg., vol. ix., p. 137.)  His onlv son Nathaniel removed to Bristol.  Rhode Island, where the familv still continues.  The tombstone of Joseph, Nathaniel's son,  still standing at Bristol, is well known as a  fine example of early carving and shows the  Reynolds coat of arms — three foxes statant in  pale proper, crest on an Esquire's helmet, a  fox statant proper.   John Reynolds' house as given in the map  of Wethersfield was on High street, the third  from the meeting house and near the center  of the town. This and other property were  recorded bv him, 'the 12th month and 11  daie, 1640.' and again recorded by John Hol-  lister on '^m 2od 1644. as 'bought of John  Reynolds.'     It was not long before internal dissensions  were disturbing the church at Wethersfield  and dividing inhabitants as well as the breth-  ren. The Rev. Richard Denton became the  leader of the more progressive and radical  party. The ministers of the other churches of  the river, and Mr. Davenport from New  Haven, successively tried to unite the fac-  tions. The latter suggested the expediency  of one of the parties removing and making a  new settlement. At length a number of men  who were the most pleased with the advice  of Mr. Davenport and the New Haven breth-  ren, and to whom the government of that  colony was most agreeable, determined to re-  move and settle in combination with New  Haven. Nathaniel Turner had on July ist,  1640, on behalf of the New Haven Colony,  bougrht of Ponus, sagamore of Toquams, and  of Wascussee, sagamore of Shippan, a tract  of land which includes the present towns of  Daricn and Stamford and part of Greenwich  paying about 33 pounds for a tract of land of  one hundred and twenty-eight square miles.  This tract, Rippowanis, Mr. .Andrew Ward  and Mr. Robert Coe, of Wethersfield, on  October 30. 1640, purchased of the New Ha-  ven Colony on behalf of themselves and about  twenty other planters on these conditions:  1st. The Wethersfield men were to give the  price paid to the Indians for the land by Mr.  Turner. 2nd. A fifth part of the lands were  to be reserved to be disposed of by the court  to such other settlers as they saw fit. 3d.  They were to join with the New Haven plan-  tation in the form of government there  adopted. Twenty men were to settle in Stam-  ford by the last of November. 1641.   It was decided that the majority of the  seven church members, church membership  being essential to becoming a freeman, should  remove with a minority of the planters and  that they should take the church orsranization  with them. Thirty men, amoner them John  Reynolds, volunteered as pioneers of the new  colonv. These subscribed '100 bushels of  cornc,' to be paid May or June, 1^141. to the  New Haven Colony, to make good the pur-  chase price of the land, each man giving as  he was able and receiving a proportional  amount of land. In this subscription, Mr.  Denton ranks third with 4.1 bu. ; Jo. Rey-  nolds, eiehth with 3.2 bu. (Stamford Rec-  ords, p. 5.)     394     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Of these thirty, twenty-eight removed to the  site of Stamford in the summer of 1641. On  October 19th they held their first meeting,  electing five men to form a provisional gov-  ernment and dividing the land between them.  An account of this is to be found at Stam-  ford in the earliest town record entitled '1640-  41 a towne book of ye free holders of ye  towne of Stamford as it was after wards  called but now Rippowan, containing the acts  and conclusions of the companie of Wethers-  field men.' At this meeting 'the man under  consideration absenting himself while his case  was in hand and so successively and when  he was called in again and demanded if so  much gave him content and so content and  satisfaction was by every one of these men  acknowledged and they set down these num-  bers of acres of marsh and upland after the  same proportion that followeth xxx Mr. Den-  ton 14 acres xxx John Renoulds 11 acres.'  (Stamford Records, p. 7.)   The New Haven Colony had not been fully  satisfied by the one hundred bushels of corn,  so that an assessment was laid to make this  good. The following is John Reynolds' ac-  count: 'For rate — now 56.10.0 and due at W.  13. s. 6 d and to received Jo Renoulds 17 S.  II d. makes 4. lbs.08-3.,' each of whom sub-  scribed a 'pick.' The next mention of him is  in a list of twelve men. Here his name ap-  pears as Jo. Renoulds. Latter is a tax list to  make good the loss of the town mill and  dam and for building a 'captain's house.'  'Jo. Reynoulds debtor for loss by mill 269,  house 13 both 39.9 and he hath paid (for loss)  at mill. First bill 9 s. 6. and dam 9 s. 3 s.  house, 12 s. last charge 5. s. all 38 s. 6d.' '   The last mention of him is in a deed recorded  March, 1651, of property in the extreme west  section of the town near the site of Old  Greenwich, bounded by 'ye lot which was  John Renoles.' (Stamford Records, p. 51.)   On page 55 of the original Stamford rec-  ords is recorded the marriage of his daugh-  ter: 'Peter Ferris and Elizabeth Rincalls  Joyned ye 15 July. 1654.' Her husband. Free-  man, of Stamford. Connecticut, 1662, renre-  sentatTve 1667. was the son of Jeffrey Fer-  ris, one of the seven original proprietors of  Greenwich, who had, like John Reynolds, re-  moved successively from Watcrtown and  Wethersficid to .Stamford. Thcv had the fol-  lowing children: i. Joseph, son of Peter Fer-     ris, b. 20-6-1657, (Stam. Rec. p. 74.) 2. Illeg-  ible, son of Peter Ferris, illegible, 1659. 3.  Elizabeth, dau. of Peter Ferris, b. 28-11-1659  — d — 5-2-1660, Stamford Rec. p. 98. 4. Mary,  dau. of Peter Ferris, b. May 2, 1662. (Stam.  Rec. p. 76.) 5. Elizabeth, dau. of Peter Ferris,  b. Jan. 2, 1664. (Stam. Rec. p. 76.)   As Peter Ferris is mentioned as Sen. in  the entry of his death, September 28, 1706, it  is probable that the illegible name was Peter.   On page 19 of the Stamford Records is en-  tered the death of the wife of John : 'Sarrah  Reanolds died 31-16-1657.' On page 20 a  second entry gives it as 'Sarra Reanols died  ye 31 August 1657.' We have records of  only three of John's children: i. Elizabeth,  b. about 1634. 2. Jonathan, b. about 1636. 3.  John, b. about 1638.   The subsequent history of John is unde-  termined. A John Reynolds, often confused  with him, was at Wethersfield as early as  June 29, 1674, when he had by Naomi Lati-  mer a son John, and a second son Jonathan.  As Naomi Latimer was born April 4, 1648, he  would have been approximately thirty-six  years older than his wife, and sixty-two years  of age when the first child was born. These  children are not to be confounded with the  John and Jonathan of Greenwich, as the his-  tories of all four are well known. It is said  that only a few years ago there was at Weth-  ersfield a tombstone to a certain John Rey-  nolds who died in 1662. The constant recur-  rence of the names John and Jonathan in the  Greenwich and Wethersfield families impliei  an intimate connection.   Jonathan, eldest son of John the Emigrant.   The site of 'Old Greenwich,' now Sound  Beach, lying some three miles to the west of  Stamford, had been purchased from the In-  dians on behalf of the New Haven Colony,  on July 18. 1640. by Robert Peaks and Cap-  tain Daniel Patrick, the latter a companion of  John Reynolds of Watertown and Wethers-  field.   About 1653 many of the settlers of Stam-  ford had moved there, and among the earl-  iest inhabitants were Jonathan and John Rey-  nolds, whose land lay along the Two Brothers'  Brook, which fact probably suggested its  name.   Subsequently to 1653 the name of Jonathan  Reynolds appears but once in the Stamford  Records: 'Jan. 7, 1666, Wm. Grimes for     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     395     swearing veanly by ye name of God it being  fully proved by Mr. Jones and Jonathan Re-  nolds and Jos. Knapp ye said Grimes is fined  ten shillings and to pay all charges of his be-  ing to Stamford which is four shillings to each  man.' This Grimes at that time was an  'Inhabitant' of Greenwich, as were the wit-  nesses.   In the Greenwich Town Records is an ac-  count of a town meeting held February 5,  1664, in which it was proposed to divide the  'common lands by a rule of proportion accord-  ing to what each man's estate shall be visable.'  The proprietors are given as follows : 'Jeffre  Ferris Sense, Joshua Knapp Sense, Joseph  Ferris, Jonathan Reynolds. Angell Heusted,  John Mead Sense, John Hobbe.' These were  termed the 'Seven Proprietors.' (Sense is an  abbreviation for Senior.)   One of the earliest deeds recorded at Green-  wich (p. 3, vol. A.) is a bill of sale bearing  date December 13, 1665, from Richard \'owles  of Rye to Jonathan Ronalds, of Green-  wich, of 'seven acres of upland more or lesse  which lieth within the compass of ye land  that was called ye ox pasture, situate in Green-  wich, bounded as followeth. northerly by ye  hye way. westerly by Grimes land and south-  erly by Joseph Ferrises land. Easterly by a  Swamp, also three acres of Maddow more or  less bounded southwest by Jonathan Ronaldoes  land.

At the bot-  tom of the page is the following :   I.

Jonathan Ronalds.  In presence of   Joseph IMead.  Timothy Knapp,   This bill and deed entered in the year of our  Lord 1682. Februari 27.   In 1667 Jonathan Reynolds was made a  member of the Assembly for Greenwich, and  on October 24tli, 1669, he was made a free-  man of Connecticut by the Assembly of Green-  wich. On December 28th, 1669, Jonathan Rey-     nolds, Sargent Lockwood, John Hobby, Joshua  Knapp, John Mead, and Joseph Mead, were  appointed to free the town of all claims by  Daniel Patrick, the son of Daniel Patrick,  formerly Patroon of the Manor, who now ap-  peared laying claims to his father's land. The  committee for the settlers who held by squat-  ter sovereignty bought him off by paying a  horse, saddle and bridle and fifty pounds. He  served on various important committees for  the laying out of lands, for making survey of  Horseneck to see if it be suitable for the  settlement of a township, as surveyor of  highways, etc., all of which appointments are  recorded in the Common Place I5ook of Green-  wich. The following is a last mention of  Jonathan in the Greenwich Records: 'At  town meeting 13, 12th month, Joshua Knapp  is chosen to be a townman in the room of  Jonathan Reynolds.' No other business was  considered at this meeting. The last previous  meeting was November 13, 1673. It is there-  fore probable that he died in November or  December, 1673.   Letters of administration on his estate now  filed at Fairfield, Connecticut, January 23,  1673-74, speak of him as 'lately deceased,'  and mention his children : Jonathan R., about  13 years; John R., about 11 years: Joseph  R., about 41^2 years ; Rebecca R., about 14  years ; Sarah R., aged 8 last November 6th ;  Elizabeth R., aged 6 last August.   Apportionment was by Angell Heusted and  Jonathan Knapp. He left a 'widow Renal.':'  and a total estate of three hundred and fifty-  eight pounds. Inventory taken March 10,  1673-74. Ebenezer, a posthumous child, was  born in 1673.   The apportionment was by Angell Heusted,  and showed a total estate of three hundred and  fifty-eight pounds. The will of Angell Heus-  ted, also filed at Fairfield in 1706, mentions  his 'son-in-law Jonathan Rcnalds.' It is pos-  sible that the 'widow Renals' mentioned in  the apportionment might have been a daughter  of Heusted. While the above estate would not  to-day be considered a large one, it was suf-  ficient to place him second among the  'Twentv-seven Proprietors of 1672,' who pur-  chased the Horseneck tract, for at that time  the rights in the distribution of land were  based upon the wealth of the colonists.   The following are the descendants of Jona-  than Revnolds as far as they have been as-     396     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     certained ; unless otherwise stated it may be  assumed that they were all of Greenwich, Con-  necticut.

The second child, Jonathan, was born in  1660, and married, Dec. 7th, 1682, Nevill Ride-  were.

The above dates, which have been obtained  from the original records, do not agree as far  as the day of the month is concerned with the  genealogy of the children of Ebenezer, which  dates are probably the dates of baptism.   The above completes the descendants of  Jonathan, the second child of the emigrant  John, as far as they have been ascertained.   JOHN REYNOLDS. (SECOND) SON OF  JOHN THE EMIGRANT.   The first entry on the first page of the first  book of deeds in Greenwich, February i, 1663.  records the purchase from Angell Heusted of  sixteen acres of land on the west side of the  Mvanos river, by John Ronalds, of Green-  wich. This purchase was augmented by five  pieces of land which Jonathan Ronalds had  purchased of Richard Vowles, December 15,  1665, and transferred on the same day to his  'brother John Ronalds.'   On October 24, 1669, John was made free-  man of Greenwich.   On July 18, 1670. William Grimes left all  his 'lands to ye disposal of Joseph Mead,  John Renals and Eliphalet Jones to be dis-  posed of by them in such a wave as they  shall judcrc meet for ye inlarging of ve town  of Greenwich by accomodating such inhabitant  or inhabitants as shall be admitted into ye  town in an orderly wav. provided they bee  such men as ve afore sd Mead, Rcnols & Tones  shall bee desirable for ve promotintr of church  & commonwealth.' This William Grimes had  on Januarv 7, 1666, been fined for swearing  and Jonathan Renolds had gone from Green-  wich to Stamford to appear aeainst him. It  was not until March 7, 1694. that it was de-     cided to dispose of the land 'for ye use of a  ministrie and if no ministrie be in ye place ye  profit of sd land and meadow shall go to  helpe maintain such as shall be employed in  teaching children to reade.'   In 1669 John was appointed one of a com-  mittee of five to purchase from the few re-  maining Indians living about the west end of  the town, the Horseneck tract three miles to  the west of 'Old Greenwich,' from which it  was separated by the Myanos river. The  original settlers remained for the most part  in the homelots at Old Greenwich and Horse-  neck, now Greenwich, was largely settled by  their children, who styled themselves as the  '27 Proprietors of 1672.' Among these  Jonathan Reynolds ranked second and his  brother John was the twenty-second among  the proprietors.   By the Greenwich inventory of 1688 it ap-  pears that the number of 'Inhabitants' had  increased to fifty, among whom was John  Reynolds, who was the wealthiest man. It  would appear that his homelot adjoined the  Church of the Second Society, for on Novem-  ber 28, 1694, he was appointed 'to supervise  the building of a meeting house which is next  to his own house.' His name constantly ap-  pears in the Greenwich Records up to the time  of his death. John was appointed justice of the  peace for Fairfield county, February 24, 1687,  and Kine's Commissioner, 1690-97.   His will, recorded in Fairfield, Connecticut,  dated April 21, 1699, and a codicil dated No-  vember 8, 1701. mentions his wife, Judah, and  children John, Judah for Judith), James,  IMary, Jonathan. Joshua and David. At the  time of his death in 1701 he was the wealthiest  'Inhabitant' of Greenwich. The widow was  appointed administratrix and the inventory  was taken prior to December 17, T701, when it  was filed. The three distributors were all of  Stamford. Joshua, the son of the deceased,  chose his brother, John Rcvnolds, as guardian,  while David chose Joseph Knapp as guardian.  To James was given land next to Gearsham  Lockwood. Joshua received land next to Jno.  Heusted. and David land next to Joseph Fer-  ris and Ephraim Palmer. The widow, his son  John, and son-in-law Samuel Retts. were ap-  pointed overseers. The daughter, Mary, had  already received her portion.   The town tax list of Greenwich in 1701-02  contains the following of the name:     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     403     Mr. John Renalls, 93 pounds; Sargent Jona-  than Renalls, 22 pounds; Joseph, Jr., 52 pounds;  Jonathan, Jr., 2J pounds; John, Jr.. 72 pounds;  Ebenezer, 44 pounds; James, 46 pounds; John, Sr.,  71 pounds.   On February 4, 1701-02, the town made  another distribution of land ; eighteen acres  were allotted to 'Mr. Renalds deceased.' He  was the largest landholder in Greenwich at  the time of his death, and this land was dis-  tributed among his sons, who, in 1706, sold  to one another the various portions which  their 'honored father, Mr. John Renals de-  ceased' had obtained from the many distribu-  tions of town land, with the evident intention  of concentrating their individual holdings.   Judah, the wife of John, was probably the  daughter of John Palmer, one of the early  settlers of Greenwich. In the settlement of  his estate recorded at Fairfield. Connecticut,  the heirs of Judah Reynolds appear with Wil-  liam, Ephraim, James and Joseph Palmer.  John Palmer is stated to have 'died many  years ago.' This bears the entry 'due August,  1716,' an addition was made to the inventory  on April 17, 1778.   Her mother's name was Judah, who was  married after the death of John Palmer to  Jefifery Ferris, one of the two purchasers of  Greenwich Point, July 18, 1640, whose will,  executed Jantiary 6, 1664, recorded in Fair-  field, mentions his wife, 'Judy.' who was his  third wife. She receipted for her dower May  6, I (167, as 'Judah Bowers, lately widow  Ferris, sometime wife to Jefifery Ferris.'  Ferris left ten pounds apiece to the four  'boies' of his wife, evidently the William,  Ephraim. James and Joseph Palmer above  mentioned.   This is still further confirmed by the will of  Ephraim Palmer above mentioned, who died  August ig, 1684. and whose will is filed at  Fairfield in book 1675-1689, page 140. The  inventory was taken by John Reynolds ; John  Bowers was the administrator, and mentions  his daughter Judith, aged 11 years. If the  above relationship is correct, John Reynolds  would have been the brother-in-law of Eph-  raim Palmer, John Bowers would have been  his stepfather, and his daughter, Judith, born  in 1673, would have been named for his sister  Judith, wife of John Reynolds, or for his  mother.   The will of John Bowers, of Greenwich,  drawn March 16, 1693-94, gives property     'that was her mother's to his daughter-in-law,  Mrs. Judah Reynolds,' and again speaks of  his 'daughter Juda Reynolds and son Mr.  John Ronalds.'   In Colonial times the stepchildren were re-  ceived into the family and referred to as sons  and daughters, thus in a deed dated April  8, 1675, and recorded at Greenwich in Vol.  A., p. 64, John Bowers gives land bounded by  that of John Renalds to his son 'Ephraim  Palmer.'   Judah, the wife of 'Mr. John Ronalds,'  had her first child as early as 1670. As Su-  sanna Lockwood, the second wife of Jeffery  Ferris, did not die until December 23! 1660,  she could not have been a daughter of Jefifery  Ferris by his third marriage. Since Jefifery  Ferris did not die until May 31, 1666, it is  still less possible that she could have been a  daughter of John Bowers. Wc are forced,  therefore, to conclude that Judah Reynolds  was the daughter of Judah by a marriage pre-  vious to that to Jefifery Ferris, and the Palmer  records above quoted make us consider tlie  conclusion warranted that her father was John  Palmer.   John Bowers married, after the death of  Judah, Hannah Knapp, widow of Joshua  Knapp. the parents of Ruth, born 1667, who  married John Reynolds, son of Jonathan, and  of Joseph Knapp, who married Elizabeth,  daughter of Jonathan Reynolds.   John Reynolds and his wife, Judah Palmer,  had the following children :   I. John, born about 1670. 2. Judith, born  about 1672. 3. James, born 1674. 4. Mary.  5. Jonathan, 1682. 6.

He received from his  father in 1695 his house and homelot at  Horseneck. He died in December. 1732. and  left a will in which he appointed his brother  Tames and his son-in-law, Samuel Mills, as  his executors. He left the following children :  I.

David — John — John.   The seventh child of John, the son of the  emigrant John, was David, born about 1689.  In October, 1720, he was appointed ensign of  the East Company, and in May, 1729, was  created a lieutenant of the Connecticut Regu-  lars. He died in 1749. He m., Nov. 24. 1720,  at the Second Society of Greenwich, Abigail,  daughter of Joseph Reynolds, who was the son  of Jonathan, the son of John the emigrant.  His widow survived him, and was granted per-  mission by the General Assembly, held in  Hartford, May ist, 1751, to sell enough of his  land to pay 598 pounds, which was the amount  of his debts. The tax books of Greenwich  show that his estate for the times was a very  large one. He had the following children :  I. David, b. Sept. 19, 1722, d. unm., Oct. 12,  1745. 2. Abigail, b.

James Reynolds, son of John and his  wife Judah, was born in Greenwich, in 1674,  and on May 10, 1697, together with several  others of 'ye young men belonging to the  towne,' received an allotment of a homelot  at Horseneck (three acres at Horseneck and  ten between the Two Brothers' Brooks).   Up to 1703 all town meetings had been held  at Greenwich Old Towne. but in that vear it  was determined to hold half of them at Horse-  neck, which was rapidly outgrowing in im-  portance the older settlement, and James was     one of those who signed the petition to the  General Assembly. In 1705 the town was  divided mto two societies, and he was ao-  pointed selectman (Dec. 31, 1705) to the Sec-  ond Society on 'ye West sd. of Myanos  River. •'   . In the Common Place Book at Greenwich  is the entry: 'Nov. i, 1706. Recorded unto  James Renals his ear mark which is a cross  upon ye top ye necr ear and two half pennies  under yc side of ye same ear.'   James was elected lieutenant of the train  band. May 14, 1719, and captain May 9 1728  He was the deputy from Greenwich to the  General Assembly, 1721-24, and 1727-38 and  justice of the peace of Fairfield county, 1735-  1741. Beginning with 1723 he was for many  years the moderator of the Second Society.  The last record of him in the books of the  Society is dated December 7, 1750.   That James Reynolds was a very large land  holder is made apparent from the many deeds  recorded in Greenwich. As early as April 21,  1706, he obtained by grant of the town eight  acres at Clap-board-tree-ridge, a hill lying  about a mile and a half back of Greenwich.  This was increased by purchase from his  brother John, December 2. 1712, and other  grants November, 1707 and 1712, until he  owned a large tract.   On March 14, 1710, he sold to Edward  Avery 'a piece of ground in Horseneck, my  homelot of 14 acres with present dwelling,  house barn and orchard bounded on the east  by a highway, southerly and westerly by ye  highway and northerly by ye land of Ebenezer  Mead and common land.'   There was recorded at White Plains. De-  cember 13, 1745, the deed from James Rey-  nolds and three co-partners of a very large  tract of land in Westchester county, held 'iiy  virtue of patent granted in 1701 and called the  East Patent.'   On May 10, 17.36, he deeded his 'well be-  loved and dutiful son Gideon Reynolds' a  very large tract of land on Clap-board-tree-  ridge, and augmented it with another granted  February 21st. 1743. ^n April 29, 1738, he  deeded part of his 'homelot in Greenwich to  his loving and dutiful son Justus.' On Sep-  tember 24, 1748, he gave his son Jeremiah  fifty acres. On February 17, 1748-40. he  gave his son, James Jr., his house and or-  chard on Clap-board-tree-ridge. This house.     4o6     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     a large gambrel structure surrounded by enor-  mous box trees, was still standing in 1897, and  was owned by the descendants of Gideon Rey-  nolds. On March 4, 1752, he deeded his lands  on the Indian Fields to his sons James Jr. and  Gideon, both of Greenwich. On March 24,  1752, he gave his lands at North Castle to  his son James Jr.   From the distribution of his property it is  apparent that he intended moving from Green-  wich to New York state, where he was prob-  ably interested in the Nine Partners Patent.  He figures in the Greenwich tax lists as late  as 1761, and in deeds describes himself as of  Greenwich in 1759-61-62.   Nevertheless, his granddaughter Anna Pal-  mer, daughter of Nathaniel Reynolds, deeded,  October i, 1760, land on Clap-board-tree-  ridge, 'in said Greenwich, which was given to  her by her honored grandfather James Rey-  nolds formerly of said Greenwich but now of  Dutchess in the Province of New York.'  (Greenwich Deeds, vol. VHI.)   James, in a deed dated August, 1761, de-  scribes himself as of Peekskill, in the county  of Westchester. James died February 14,  1767, at Amenia, Dutchess county, N. Y.,  and was buried in the Amenia City (Smith-  field) graveyard, where his stone still exists.  Family tradition states that he was visiting:  his son James, who is also buried there. A  letter written in 1848 states that 'he was  laree and made a fine appearance.''   From a deed signed December 22, 1731, bv  Captain James Reynolds and his wife Sarah,  it appears that she was the daughter of Mary  Hobby, who married, November 18. 1686  (Stamford Records, p. T18), -Stephen Holmes  (b. Jan. 14, 1664-65. at Stamford, d. May 15.  1710, Greenwich). The deed (Greenwich,  vol. A, p. 131) covers 'part of lot or ri.ght  of land that was given by John Hobbv of  Greenwich, deceased, unto his daughter Marv  and her children, and T. Sarah Renvalls. am  one of the children of ye said Mary Holmes.'  The said land was granted to her by her hon-  ored father John Hobby 'Dec. 22, Anno Dom.,  1731.' The latter was on the voters' list of  Greenwich as early as 1658, and the inventory  nf his estate. April 24. 1707. mentions 'dau.  Mary Holmes, wife of Stephen Holmes.'  John Hobby was the son of Tohn Hobbv, one  of the seven original proprietors of Green-  wich (1664).     Stephen Holmes, b. Jan. 14. 1664-5, iri  Stamford (Stamford Records, p. 76), d. May  15, 1710, in Greenwich (Stamford Records, p.  143), was the son of John Holmes, b. 1635,  d. July 6. 1703 (Stamford Records, p. 113),  and Rachel Waterbury, who removed to Bed-  ford. Westchester county, N. Y., in 1680.  They were married at Stamford, Dec. 3, 1659  (Stamford Records, p. 76). Rachel Water-  bury was the daughter of John W'aterbury,  who died at Stamford 3-15-1658 (Stamford  Records, p. 20). John Holmes receipted on  behalf of his wife 'Rachel out of ye estate  of her deceased father John Waterbury 10-  12m- 1 668' (Stamford Records, p. 68).   The Common Place Book at Greenwich  gives the births of four of James' children:  'Sarah Renalds ye daughter of James Renals  was born ( ?) 25, 1698. James Renalds son  of James Renals b. July 6, 1700. Nathaniel  Renals son of James, b. Feb. 20, 1702-3. Mary  Renals. dau of James b. Feb. 9, 1704-5. That  he was the father of Gideon, Justus and Jere-  miah, appears from the deeds of gifts already  quoted.   James had the following children, though  whether they were all by Sarah Holmes is not  known: i. Sarah, b. 1698, subsequent history  unknown.   2. James — James — John — John.   2 James, b.

Nathaniel — James — John — John.   3. Nathaniel was born at Greenwich, Feb.  20, 1702-3, where his birth is given in the Com-  mon Place Book. While the Greenwich Rec-  ords of this period make constant mention of  a Nathaniel Reynolds, it is not always pos-  sible to determine which refer to him and  which to Nathaniel, b. 1715, son of Ebenezer.   He, together with Joshua, Peter and James  Jr.. petitioned the General Assembly in 1753  to be 'set off from the Parish of Stanwich in  the South West of which they lived and to be  joined to the Parish of Horseneck.' He was  elected constable for Greenwich, Dec. 27,   1728. The records of the Second Church at  Greenwich contain the record of his marriage.  'On ye first day of January 1728-0 Nathaniel  Reynolds was married to his wife Ruth whose  name was Purdy.' The Greenwich Common  Place Book gives the births of two of his chil-  dren : 'Nathaniel Renalds' cJiildren : Dec. 8,   1729. Nathaniel; Jan. 8, 1731, Frances Ren-  yalls.'   At a court of probate held in Stamford  June 7, 1748, letters of administration were  granted on the estate of Nathaniel Reynolds,  late of Greenwich, deceased, and Ruth his  widow was appointed administratrix. Dis-  tribution was made April 7, 1752: after pay-  ing debts amounting to 580 pounds there re-  mained for the children 413 pounds and a large  amount of real estate. His children are stated  to be Nathaniel, Francis, Solomon, Stephen,  Ruth. Anna and Hannah.   In Vol. 7, p. 67. of the Greenwich Deeds,  is recorded the following: 'Know all men  that T. James Reynolds. Senior, of Greenwich,  in consideration of the love I have for my  grandsons, namely. Nathaniel Reynolds, Fran-  cis Revnolds. Stephen Reynolds, and .Solomon  Reynolds, all natural sons to Nathaniel Rey-  nolds, of Greenwich, and also bv the love and     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     409     good will I bear to their natural mother, Ruth  Reynolds, widow and relect of the deceased  Nathaniel,' etc., Feb. 2, 1749-50.   Ruth Purdy belonged to the well known  family of Rye, N. Y. Francis Purdy in a  deed of 1718 was described as 'of Green-  wich,' as was John Purdy in 1727. As Ruth  was married in Greenwich and had a son  Francis, the probability is that she was a  daughter of Francis Purdy. Both John and  Francis were sons of Joseph Purdy, who ap-  peared at Rye in 1677. He was the son of  Francis, who was an early inhabitant of Fair-  field, Conn., and died in 1658. The Purdy  genealogy in the 'History of Rye' is incom-  plete, and that of Bolton is obviously inaccu-  rate. To determine the line of descent will  necessitate a study of the original town rec-  ords.   Ruth, after the death of Nathaniel, married  Jonathan Fiske, of Greenwich. In the dis-  tribution of his estate recorded at Stamford,  July 2T, 1762, mention is made of the use  by his widow of one third part of said de-  scribed lands, being conveyed to said widow  by her father-in-law, Mr. James Reynolds, in  part, and partly came by her husband, Nathan-  iel Reynolds, deceased.   Nathaniel had the following descendants :  I. Nathaniel, b. Deo. 8. 1729, removed to Cross  River, Westchester co.. N. Y. Letters of ad-  ministration which were granted to his son  Nathaniel, Dec. 23, 1805, describe him as a  resident of Salem, Westchester county, N. Y.  He had: i. Nathaniel, b. in Cross River, Feb.  22. 1754, m. Oct. 15. 1778, Hannah Todd fthe  widow Cooley). who was born May 26, 1750.  d. Apr. II. 1846. He was a second lieutenant  of the 3rd Regiment of Westchester county  militia, commanded by Col. Samuel Drake,  and was taken prisoner June 24, 1779, re-  leased Oct. 24, 1781.   In his will, drawn December 20th. 1830,  probated Jan. 22, 1844, at \\nTite Plains, he  describes himself as being of South Salem.  N. Y. He died Sept. 21, 1843, and had: i.  Deborah, b. July 17, 1779, d. May 24, 1844. m.  1798, Aaron Morehouse, 2. Nathaniel, b. Aug.  7, 1782, m. Lizzie Avery, d. Mch. 1874, 3.  Lydia, b. Aug. 28, 1784, m. Rev. Joshua H.  Hobbv. she d.

Aug. 19, 1803, m. Mary Vivian.   Nathaniel and his wife Ruth Purdy also  had: 2. Francis, b. July 8, 1731. Nothing  is known of his descendants. There was a  Francis Reynolds who lived at Crum Elbow,  Dutchess county, N. Y., at this time, and it is  probable that they were identical. 3. Ruth,   b. about 1733, m. Merritt, and' in 1760   she was living on the property at Clap-board-  tree-ridge given her by her grandfather James.  4. Solomon, b. about 1735, nothing is known  of his descendants. There was a Solomon  who lived at Poundridge. N. Y.. another at  Crum Elbow, N. Y.. and one at Woodbury,  Conn., 5. Anna, b. about 1737, m. Samuel Pal-  mer. In a deed recorded at Greenwich in vol.  \'III, dated Feb. 25, 1760, '.'>amuel Palmer  and Anna Palmer his wife of Greenwich sells  to David Knapp two acres in said Greenwich  which was given to the said Anna by her hon-  ored grandfather James Reynolds, formerly  of said Greenwich, but now of Dutchess in the  province of New York a lot on Clap-board-  tree-ridge, bounded east by our sister Mer-  ritts, west by our sister Hannah Fiske.' Their  descendants lived in Westchester county. 6.  Stephen, b. Dec. 31, 1740 (for his descendants  see hereinafter), 7. Hannah, m. July 21, 1762,  Jonathan Fiske, the son of Jonathan Fiske,  who married her widowed mother Ruth  Purdv. Their descendants reside in Saratoga  county and at Troy, N. Y.  Stephen — Nathaniel — James — John — John.   In a deed recorded at Greenwich, vol. ix. p.  52, Feb. 2. 1762, Stephen described himself as  of 'Woodbury, county Litchfield.' and sells  to Jonathan Fiske his share of his father Na-  thaniel's estate and of his .grandfather's, James  Reynolds, of Dutchess countv. N. Y. The  fact that he removed to Woodbury, Connecti-  cut, as soon as he had reached his majority.     4IO     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     coupled with the fact that there was a Solo-  mon there residing, makes the identification of  the' latter with Solomon, son of Nathaniel,  more than probable. The Woodbury family  of Reynolds are attributed without apparent  authority to John of Wethersfield. (Note.  All of the data from the time that Stephen left  Woodbury are derived from family records.)  Stephen removed to Amenia City, Dutchess  county, prior to 1763, where his uncle James  lived, and where his grandfather James died,  and erected in 1764 a residence on the old Al-  bany post road and about a half mile to the  north of the Amenia City (Smithfield)  Church. This contained three rooms of the  entire width of the house, with kitchens and  dependences behind. It was of frame, and a  story and a half high. It was torn down in  1877.   He is probably identical with the Stephen  Reynolds who enlisted in the Continental  Army, Capt. Daniel Shepard's company (see  'Nevv York in the Revolution,' pp. 259-454)  during the Revolution, in the New York  forces, since there is no record of any other  Stephen of an age which would have made it  possible for him to take part in this war. He  died in Amenia, August 17. 181 5. and is buried  in the 'City' (Smithfield) graveyard. His  will is recorded in Poughkeepsie, N. Y.   He married, Amenia, N. Y., February 1st,  1763, Rachel Denton. She was born April 12,  1742 (o. s.), and died in Albany, N. Y., No-  vember 10, 1815, while on her way to visit  her son Stephen, at Minaville, N. Y.. and was  buried in one of the church burial grounds in  Albany, and in 1856 her remains were trans-  ferred to the Reynolds plot in the Albany  Rural Cemetery. Her father was Benjamin  Denton, of Foster's Meadows, Wallingford,  Connecticut, also of Farmington, Connecticut,  and Amenia, New York ; married at Farm-  ington, December i, 1724, Rachel Wheeler, of  Hartford, Connecticut. He was the son of  Richard Denton (died in 1699'), the son of  Nathaniel Denton, of Jamaica. L. I., the son  of Richard Denton, of Flalifax, England  (born in 1586), a clergyman, a graduate of  Cambridge University in T623. who came to  America in 1634 and settled in Watertown,  Connecticut. He led those colonists who  founded the settlement at Wethersfield and  subsequently removed to Stamford with the  first settlers. Cotton Mather eulogizes him     in his Magnala. He removed to Long Island,  returned to England and died there.   Stephen and his wife Rachel Denton had  the following children: i. Stephen, b. Sept.  I, 1765 (o. s.), see hereinafter. 2.

Stephen Reynolds, M.D., son of Stephen  Reynolds and Rachel Denton, was born in  Amenia, Dutchess county, N. Y., September  I, 1765 (o. s.), July 31, 1765 (n. s.). His  class poem written in his freshman year, which  is still in existence, is evidence that he went  to college, but to which one is unknown. He  died in Amsterdam, N. Y., July 8th, 1833,  while visiting his nephew, Deodatus Wright,  and was buried there.   He studied medicine with James Potter,  M. D., at New Fairfield, Connecticut, 1784;  removed to Minaville, town of Florida, Mont-  gomery county, N. Y., in 1785, and practiced  there until May 1832, when he removed to  Schenectady, N. Y., having purchased No. 25  No. Church street, the next building north  of the Dutch Church. He was a celebrated  Latin scholar and something of a poet. He  was the founder and president of the Wash-  ington Benevolent Society, and going to Phila-  delphia he commissioned Sir Gilbert Stewart  to paint a replica of his portrait of Washing-  ton, which he presented to the Society. When  the Society was disbanded the portrait was  returned to him, and it is now in the posses-  sion of his great-.granddaughter. Mrs. Frank  P. Wilder, of Saratoga (Josephine Voorhees).  He was the president of the Mont,gomery  Aledical Society, which issued certificates en-  titling its members to practice medicine, and  was one of the first in this portion of the coun-  try to hold clinics.   Portraits of Stephen and his wife Lydia  Rartlett. painted by Ames, about 1812, are in  possession of their granddaughter, the widow  of Rev. William C. Hopkins, of Toledo. Ohio.   He married, at Warrensburgh, Florida,     Montgomery county, N. Y., October 29, 1787,  Lydia Bartlett, who was born at Lebanon,  Connecticut, August 27, 1770, and died at  Amsterdam, N.

Marcus Tullius, son of Dr. Stephen Rey-  nolds and Lydia Bartlett, was born in Mina-  ville, Florida township, Montgomery county,  N. Y., December 29, 1788; died at his resi-  dence, No. 25 No. Pearl street. Albany. N. Y.,  July II, 1864, and was buried in the Albany  Rural Cemetery.   When he was ten years of age he was sent  to the high school at Canajoharie, N. Y.,  w'here he remained three years, and on leaving  there he entered a collegiate school at Utica,  where he was fitted for college. In 1805 he  entered Union College, and was graduated,  ranking second in the class of 1808. He was  an excellent classical student, and also en-  joyed the study of philosophy. He began the  study of law in the oflSce of Matthias B. Hil-  dreth, of Johnstown, Fulton county. New  York, who was many years the attorney gen-  eral of New York state. He was admitted to  the bar February 14, 181 1, and early evinced  those talents which enabled him to advance  rapidly. He practiced at Johnstown for seven-  teen years, where he was compelled to con-  tend with the talented lawyer, David Cady. In  May, 1828, he removed to Albany, N. Y.,  where he passed the rem.ainder of his life.   'From the year 1837 down to the adoption  of the Code of Procedure, Marcus T. Rey-  nolds, Samuel Stevens and Nicholas Hill were  regarded impartially as the three most prom-  inent lawyers in New York state. It was  said that a reference to the reports of cases  argued in the appellate courts of the state  from 1817 to 185-3, when he retired, will show  that Marcus T. Reynolds was coimsel in more  cases adjudicated in the supreme court and the  court for the correction of errors than almost  any other lawyer of this state. During a pe-  riod of twenty-six years he was second to  none as a barri.ster, and the story of his career  during that time is the history of the su-     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     413     preme court, court of correction of errors and  the court of appeals.   'He had the faculty of passing from grave  to gay, from lively to severe, with surprising  facility. He carried his cases, by being thor-  oughly imbued with them himself, and then,  by a clear and well defined statement to the  court and jury, imparting the impression that  he had no doubt of the right of his case. Be-  fore a jury he had a sort of magnetic power,  by which he photographed his own ideas and  reasons upon the minds of the jury.' (See  Proctor's ''Bench and Bar,' and 'Proceed-  ings of the Albany Bar on the Death of Mar-  cus T. Reynolds,' Albany Evening Journal,  July 15, 1864.)   He was confirmed by the senate as justice  of supreme court, July 7, 1849, ^^^ '^'•''^^ s^'so  elected congressman. Within a year or two  of the operation of the first passenger railway  train, in 1831, he became concerned in the  organization of steam roads, and when on  May 5, T836, several small lines consolidated  as the Albany & West Stockbridge railroad,  the last line to the west of what later became  the Boston & Albany road, he was elected  president of the new company. He was also  chosen president of the Utica & Schenectady  railroad, later merged into the New York  Central lines, and was president of the Albany  & Northern railroad. ~ He was a director of  the Albany Insurance Company from 1835 ^^  1863 : a director of the New York State Bank  from Tune. 1840, to Julv. 1861 : a founder of  the Albany Hospital, organized in 184Q; a  founder and trustee of the Albany Orphan  Asylum, organized May 19, 1830; an organizer  and fourth largest contributor to the Albany  Rural Cemetery, and one of the largest con-  tributors to the founding of the Dudley Ob-  servatory in 1852 : elected a vestryman of St.  Peter's Episcopal Church in 1842, and ad-  vanced to warden in 1843, serving through  i860, and chairman of its most important  committees, e. g., March 25. 1845. to sell the  church land on Maiden Lane, Pine and Lodge  streets ; 1845, to procure a new rectory ; 1855,  to secure funds for the new church edifice  which was consecrated October 4, i860.   He resided a long time at No. 7 Park Place,  Albany, which site was taken about 1870 for  the new capitol. His last residence was at  the southeast corner of Maiden Lane and     Pearl street, where he practiced law and lived  with his family.   Many years before his death he was thrown  from his horse, the fall producing an injury  to one of his knee-pans, of such serious na-  ture that amputation became necessary. He  was immediately carried into a store, where  a skilled surgeon determined that an opera-  tion must inevitably follow, stating further  that perhaps it had better be done on the  following day. 'I wish you to proceed in-  stantly, for I cannot have the matter upon  my mind,' said Mr. Reynolds. The surgeon  obeyed.

He received his early education at the  College Hill Academy in Poughkeepsie. N.  Y., and containued his preliminary studies al  the .Albany .Academy, which he entered in tlie  fall of 1842. remaininsr two vcars. when he  v.\n- prepared to enter LTnion College in 1844.  Here he joined the Sigma Phi fraternity, and  was a classmate of President Chester .A. -Ar-  thur, who was an intimate friend in lafer  years. He graduated July 26. 1848. ranlcmg  second in his class of 120. and was honored     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     415     with the Latin salutatory. He attended the  Lawrence Scientific School at Cambridge,  Mass., the year of its founding, 1848-9, and  was a graduate of the Harvard Law School,  class of 1850. He was admitted to the bar  at Albany, December 2, 185 1, and in 1853  wrote the volume published by Gould, Banks  & Co.. Albany, 1853, 'A Treatise on the Law  of Life Assurance.' He formed a partner-  ship with Orlando Meads. Afterwards he  was in partnership with John Olcott, son of  Thomas \\'orth Olcott, the banker. Later on  he was associated with the law firm of M. T.  &: L. G. Hun, nephews, at No. 25 No. Pearl  street, ^^'ith his friends. Erastus Corning and  T. Howard King, he made a number of visits to  ^\'estern states on hunting trips, and it was  then he purchased large tracts of land in  Iowa, equal in extent to nearly half the area  of that state. His final sale in closing the in-  vestment was 210,000 acres. In the Civil War  he was paymaster of the Third Regiment, and  went to Richmond, Virginia, under Gen. Fred-  erick Townsend, commanding.   His patented inventions numbered twenty  or more, and each of these was among the  pioneers of very important lines. He first  gave considerable study to the manufacture of  paper from wood pulp at a time such processes  were not practical or paying. In 1858 he pub-  lished a treatise on the subject. His investi-  gation was most thorough, and gave an im-  petus to the trade at a time of discouragement.   Among the earliest of his inventions was a  typesetter, which he manufactured in Roch-  ester, previous to 1873, and followed this with  an automatic distributor, which was the first  attempt to distribute movable type by machine.  In this connection he invented the notching  of type. It was placed in a publishing house  in Albany' about 1876. and was discounte-  nanced by the printers, who saw their means  of support about to disappear through a sav-  ing to the empln-er. The theorv of this ma-  chine was utilized by a manufacturer of such  machines, and a tedious lawsuit for infringe-  ment resulted, which was finally compromised  A direct steel and wrought iron process oc-  cupied his attention for some twenty years,  which led to an experimental furnace erected  in the early spring of 1903, which was the  first to nodulize fine ores in a revolving cyl-  indrical furnace, which ores had hitherto been     of value only when briquetted. This process,  the furnaces now enlarged to over a hundred  feet, is in general use throughout the coun-  try for nodulizing flue dust and magnetically  separated ores.   Dexter Reynolds married, at Rochester, N.  Y., April 19, 1865, Catherine Malcy Cuyler  (see Cuyler Family), Rev. R. Bethel Clax-  ton, of St. Luke's Episcopal Churcii, officiat-  ing. They resided at 20 Elk street, Albany,  N. Y. She was born in Cuylerville, Living-  stun county, N. Y., December 2, 1845 ; was  educated at a boarding school in Ulica, N. Y.,  died while visiting in Rochester, October 23,  1875, and was buried in the Reynolds lot in  the Albany Rural Cemetery. Her father was  Col. William Tremper Cuyler, who was born  in Albany, December 22, 1802, died in Cuy-  lerville, N. Y., December 21, 1864, and was  the son of John Cornelius Cuyler (born in  Schenectady, N. Y., Dec. 5, 1766, died there  October 25, 1828), and Hannah Maley (b.  Oct. 12, 1769). Her mother was Nancy  Bancker Stewart, who was born in Leicester,  N. Y., Feb., 1810, died Feb. 3, 1848, and  was daughter of John Stewart and Nancy  Bancker Clute (born in Schenectady, N. Y.,  Dec. 25, 1776, died in Moscow, N. Y., Apr.  28, 1864). Dexter Reynolds and Catherine  Maley Cuyler had children — Cuyler and Mar-  cus Tullius.   Cuyler Reynolds, son of Dexter Reynolds  and Catherine Maley Cuyler, was born at 98  Columbia street, Albany, N. Y., August 14  1866.   At the Albany Academy and a board-  ing school in Catskill, N. Y., he received his  education, which developed particularly his  faculties as a writer, establishing in 1885 the  school paper, of which he was made its editor-  in-chief. He engaged in newspaper work and  followed it some fifteen years, at the same  time contributing to more than a score of  the better magazines. Turning his attention  then to the writing of books, novels and ref-  erence works, he produced ten or more, the  most valuable of which were his 'Classified  Quotations,' Putnam, 1905, and 'Albany  Chronicles,' 1907, the latter a volume so com-  prehensive and copiously illustrated that it is  likely to endure and be cited as one of the best  authorities of state history. Later he be-  came editor-in-chief of the 'Hudson-Mohawk     4i6     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Genealogical and Family Memoirs,' in four  octavo volumes.   By a scientific study and enumeration of  the letters of the alphabet as they occurred  in books, magazines and newspapers, he ar-  ranged a table of the recurrence of letters,  which results he set forth in a monograph  entitled 'The Recurrence of Letters,' read be-  fore the Albany Institute in 1894, then pub-  lished in Paper and Press in 1895, and while  it served as a key for the solution of ciphers  or secret writing, its more practical use was  in its application to the keyboards of type-  setting machines, and in this form is univer-  sally used.   Much interested in historical research, es-  pecially as it concerned his home city, he was  made director of the Albany Institute and  Historical and Art Society at its annual meet-  ing in 1899, and continued as such for ten  years. He made for this society several of its  most noteworthy collections, numbering a  dozen or more, at the same time filling the  office of librarian. As librarian, he gathered  nearly one thousand books written by Alban-  ians, which list composed a biographical cat-  alogue of 114 pages in 1902. The opening  of this institution's new building. May 12,  1908, gave him opportunity to originate the  novel system of indexing and the method of  keeping the various record books.   In March, 1907, he received the appoint-  ment of director of the New York State His-  tory Exhibit for the Jamestown Exposition ;  collected and installed it in systematic order,  the features of which he set forth in an elab-  orately illustrated Catalogue of Exhibit, with  the Exposition's Gold Medal as the result.  Afterwards he wrote the State's report, a  handsome volume, copiously illustrated, and  of about five hundred pages, published in  1910.   He was elected to honorary membership  in the American Scenic and Historic Preser-  vation Society in 1908, and in the New York  State Historical Association in 1909. He is  also a member of the National Geographic  Society, American Historical Association and  of the American Copyright League. He has  resided all his life in Albany.   He married, at the Cathedral of .Ml Saints,  Albany, N. Y., Dean Wilford L. Robbins offi-  ciating, September 24, 1891, Janet Gray     Gould. She was born in Albany, July 22,  1871, and was educated at the Albany Female  Academy. Her father was Captain Charles  Gould, born in .Albany, October 28, 1848, died  in Albany, July 4, 1896, who was the son of  William Gould (b. in Caldwell, N. J., Nov.  z6, 1814, d. in Albany, June 27, 1886), and  Sarah Margaret Hartness (b. in Albany, Sept.  24, 1821, d. there. December 12, 1884), and  married, in Albany, September 12, 1842. Her  mother was Janet Gray, born in Albany, Sep-  tember 20, 1850; married, Albany, October  4, 1870, died at Montclair, N. J., April 6,  1910, who was the daughter of Daniel Alex-  ander Gray (b. in New York City, in 1817,  d. in Albany, Nov. 19, 1880), and Catherine  Meyers (born in Hanover, Ger., Aug. 2,  1816. died Albany, Apr. i, 1880). They had:  Kenneth Gray, b. in Albany, N. Y., Sept. 17,   1892, educated at the Albany Academy and  St. Paul's School, Concord, N. H.   Dexter Reynolds had also by his wife Cath-  erine Maley Cuyler: Marcus Tullius, born  at Great Harrington, Mass., August 20. 1869;  prepared for college at St. Paul's School,  Concord, New Hampshire, 1882-86; entered  Williams College, 1886, Sigma Phi fraternity,  and was graduated July 2, 1890. He studied  architecture in the School of Mines, Colum-  bia University, and was graduated, 1893, with  the degree of Ph.B. He is author of 'Hous-  ing of the Poor in American Cities,' the prize  essay of the American Economic Society for   1893, and received therefor the degree of  M.A., Williams College, 189,^. He studied  architecture in Paris, Rome, Athens, etc., and  returning to America in October, 1895, be-  gan practicing architecture in Albany, N. Y.,  and has there continued. His specialty is the  designing of banks, of which he has been the  architect of sixteen.   He has collected and compiled the earlier  and collateral data presented in the above  genealogical tables, supplementing the work  begun by his father. Dexter Reynolds, who  began with the descendants of James, the son  of John, the son of John the emigrant.     C h a u n c e y Mitchell Depew,  DEPEW statesman, counsellor, orator,   and man of large affairs, is de-  scended from a famous Huguenot family, and  his New England ancestry includes the im-     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     4T7     portant Mitchell, Sherman, Palmer, Winship,  Wellington, Minott, Cliauncey and Johnstone  families, various of whom are hereinafter  mentioned.   The name Du Puy or De Puy is one of  the most ancient known in French history,  and was prominent in Nomiandy as early as  the eleventh century. Raphael Du Puy was  an officer of rank in 1030, under Conrad II.,  of the Holy Roman Empire, and his son  Hug;lies distinguished himself in the Crusades.  The history of the family in France is marked  down the centuries by many noted names in  both church and state. The surname Du Puy  has masqueraded in many forms in its pass-  age from France to Holland, and thence to  America. It is found recorded as Dupuis,  Depui, Depuy, Depee, Depuy, De Pue, Depu,  etc. Francois, grandson of the original Fran-  cois, who was baptized August 20, 1700, in  the old Dutch church of Sleepy Hollow, at  Tarrytown, is generally recorded as Frans  De Pew ; later the name took its present form  of Depew.   (I) Francois Dupuis fled from France on  account of religious persecution and took ref-  uge in Holland, whence he came to America,  being the first of the family to locate in New  Amsterdam. The earliest record of him shows  him as one of the first twenty inhabitants of  Boswyck (modern Bushwick), now a compo-  nent part of Brooklyn. He signed a petition,  dated March 14, 1661, asking for privileges  usually desired by a newly incorporated vil-  lage. In 1663 his name is enrolled as a mem-  ber of a company of militia with Ryck Lykeker  as captain, this company being probably or-  ganized for the purpose of protection against  the Indians. It is uncertain how long he  lived at Bushwick, as William is his only  child known to have been born there, although  there may have been others. He may have  resided in New York for a time, although  this is uncertain. During the years 1671-77  the baptism of three of his children is re-  corded in the New York Reformed Church.  In 1677 't is claimed that he and his wife  became members of the church at Flatbush,  where their next two children were baptized  in 1679 'I'l'i 1 68 1 respectively. He had a grant  of about eighty acres of land on the south  side of the Fresh Kill on Staten Island, bear-  ing date December 21, 1680, and April 4,     1685, received another grant on the island at  Smoking Point. In 1686 Francois Dupuis  had his son Nicholas baptized in New York,  and the following year is mentioned as a resi-  dent of Rockland (now a part of Orange  county), where on September 26 he signed  the oath of allegiance with other inhabitants  of the recently established settlements of Hav-  erstraw and Orangetown. Three of his chil-  dren married and settled in Rockland county,  but he had crossed the river before the cen-  sus of Orange in 1702, and located at Peeks-  kill, Westchester county (where others of his  children had made their liomes), and settled  on a tract of land originally purchased from  the Indians in 1685, under a license from Gov-  ernor Dongan. In this connection it is inter-  esting to note that part of this land was held  in fee in the family until the last of his share,  after having been in the family two hundred  and eleven years, was in 1896 given by Chaun-  cey Mitchell Depew to the village of Peeks-  kill for a public park.   Mary, youngest child of Francois Dupuis,  was baptized in New York, where her mother  is mentioned as Annie Elsten, who must have  been his second wife. On April i, 1702, he  and his daughter Maria are named as spon-  sors or godparents at the baptism of his  granddaughter, Grietje Quorry, in the Sleepy  Hollow church, and a few years later both he  and this daughter are recorded as members  of the church, having residence on the patent  of Captain De Kay and Ryck Abrahamsen  Lent, a grandson of the latter having previ-  ously married Maria. It is supposed he paid  close attention to the cultivation of his land  and his private afl^airs, as his name appears  so seldom in public records, but through care-  ful research among the records of the Re-  formed churches at New York, Tappan, Tar-  rytown and Cortlandt, enough scraps of in-  formation have been found to piece together  the record of his descendants which is given  below. On August 26, 1661, the baims of  his first marriage were published in the rec-  ords of the Reformed Dutch Church of New  Amsterdam, as follows: 'Francois Dupuis,  young man of Calais, France, and Geertje  Willems, of Amsterdam.' They were mar-  ried just one month later, in Breuckelcn, their  marriage being the fifth of record in the Dutch  church there, as follows: '26 September,     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     1661, Francois Dupuis and Geertje Willems,  with certificate from Manhattans.' It is be-  lieved by eminent authority that Geertje Wil-  lems was a daughter of W'illem Jacobse \'an  Boerum, of l-latbush, who came with his fam-  ily in 1649 from Amsterdam, Holland, given  in the register of the banns as the birthplace  of Geertje. Children of Francois Dupuis:  William, of whom further; Jannetje (Jane),  married Kellem Quorry, or MaKorry ; Grietje  (Margaret), baptized in New York, October  I, 1671, married Jan Ward, of Haverstraw ;  Jean (John), baptized in New York, May 20,  1674, married Jannetje Wiltse, widow of  Myndert Hendreickse (Hogencamp) ; a child  (not named), whose baptismal entry was  made at New York, February 14, 1677, and  who may have been Maria, who was sponsor  with her father in 1702, about which time  she married Abraham Hendrickse Lent, of  Tarrytown; Sara, baptized at Flatbush, Feb-  ruary 23, 1679, married Herman Hendrickse  Blauvelt; Geertje (Gertrude), baptized at  Flatbush, September 18, 1681, of whom fur-  ther record is not to be found; Nicholaes,  baptized in New York, October 17, 1686,  whose wife's name was Barbara; Mary, bap-  tized in New York City, March 3, 1689, the  record of the parents being 'Francois Puy  and Annie Elsten,' no further record being  given of cither mother or child.   (H) Williain Depcw, probably eldest child  of Francois and Geertje (Willems) Dupuis,  was born at I'ushwick, and was among the  pioneers of the locality made famous as the  birthplace of Senator Chauncey M. Depew.  It wo\ild seem that he had made camp on the  point of land called by the Indians Meanagh.  or Mernach, and afterwards named Ver-  planck's Point, when the settlement had  hardly begun, he then being unmarried. He  was at Mernach as early as 168S, and prob-  ably strayed over from Haverstraw, where his  father had located a year or two previous,  and where his brother John continued to live  for several years afterwards. He there made  a home for his future bride, a maiden born  on the island of Barbadoes, and doubtless of  English parentage, shown on the records as  Lysbeth Weyt, which in English would be  Elizabeth White. She was living a little fur-  ther down the river at a place bearing the  Indian name of Knightwanck, near the mouth     of the Croton river, which stream also bore  the name of the locality. Record of the banns  was posted on the register of the Dutch church  of New York, the nearest one to their home,  which church issued a certificate permitting  \\'illiam to marry at the home of the bride.  The record is as follows: 'loth August, 1688,  William Dupuy, j. m. Van Boswyck, en Lys-  beth Weyt, j. m. van de Barbadoes, d'Eerste  wonende op Mernach, en twede tot Kichte-  wang.' This marriage was jjrobably executed  in primitive style at Kichtewang during the  following month, perhaps the first marriage  in the Manor of Cortlandt, and spoken of as  the forerunner of an event that made Peeks-  kill renowned as the home of a great and  popular orator in a later generation of the  family. William Dupois had children as fol-  lows : Sara, married Willem Dill, Theil or  Teil; Abigael, married Pieter Consje;  Thomas, married Cornelia Lendel ; Anna, bap-  tized at Tarrytown, August 2, 1698; Francois,  of whom further; Pieter. The father's name  was usually spelled Dupuy.   (HI) Francois (2), son of William and  Lysbeth (Weyt) Depew, was born near Tar-  rytown, New York, in August, 1700, and was  baptized August 20, 1700. Not very much  is known of him beyond the fact that he was  engaged in the regular jjioneer and agricul-  tural work of the neighborhood around Cort-  landt manor. He married, at Tarrytown,  New York, June 3, 1727, Maritje Van Thes-  sel. This marriage is recorded in the Tarry-  town church in the style of the period : 'Frans  De Pew j. m., en Maritje Van Thessel.'' The  record also states that they were both born  on Cortlandt Manor, he being a resident  there, and she a resident of Tarrytown.  Children: Hendrikus, of whom further; An-  neke, baptized at Tarrytown, August 21, 1730;  William, born 1732, the muster roll of West-  chester county militia saying of him in 1758,  ''born in Cortlandt, aged 26,' there being no  further record concerning him ; Elizaljeth.  baptized at Tarrytown, April 23, 1734. mar-  ried, October 29, 1758, John Lent; Abraham,  baptized at Tarrytown, April 13, 1736, died  young; Sarah, baptized at Tarrytown, April  19, 1738; Abraham, April 30, 1743.   (I\') Hendrikus or Henry, son of Francois  (2) and Maritje (Van Thessel) Depew, was  baptized at Tarrytown, New York, April 27,      C%CLUAA4^mybW^     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     419     1728. \'ery little is known concerning the  events of the life of Hendrikus. The only  child that the records credit to him is Abra-  ham, mentioned below. The mother's name is  not mentioned. The sponsors at Abraham's  baptism, which took place in the Dutch church  at Tarrytown, were 'Frans Pue and wife,'  without doubt the parents of Hendrikus. It  is fortunate for this lineage, perhaps, that  Abraham received so marked a distinction as  to have his baptism recorded. The other  children of Hendrikus, and it seems that they  had others, were not so favored. Colonel  Teetor says of Abraham that he was in the  Revolutionary war, and that he was the great-  grandfather of Chauncey Mitchell Depew.  Our own researches have tended to confirm  this theory.   (V) Abraham, son of Hendrikus or Henry  Depew, was born at Cortlandt Manor. New  York, and was baptized in the Dutch church  at Tarrytown, New York, April 5, 1752. His  youth was undoubtedly spent on the family  homestead, and he in all probability received  the general education of the period. There  are a good many records in Tarrytown and  Cortlandt concerning various Abrahams De-  pew, but it is usually difficult to ascertain to  which particular Abraham any two records  refer. One authority says : 'The church bap-  tismal records of Tarrytown and Cortlandt  furnish very good grounds for confusion  among the various Abrahams Depew. While  there is an apparent lack of records in some  directions, there seems to be a perplexing  superfluity of fathers Abraham, whose sons  and daughters, to straighten and place where  they belong, would take a man with more wis-  dom than Solomon.' Concerning Abraham  Depew, the son of Hendrikus Depew, another  authority gives us definite particulars. Abra-  ham Depew enlisted January 2. I777- ^o'' ''^^  revolutionary war, in Captain Jacob Wright's  company, in the regiment commanded by  Colonel Phillip Van Cortlandt. He was pro-  moted corporal, June i, 1777, and was dis-  charged January 3, 1780, on account of the  expiration of term of service. He married  Catherine, daughter of Captain James Kron-  kite, who was commissioned captain, October  19. I775> and served in the Third Regiment,  Manor of Cortlandt, commanded by Colonel  Pierre Van Cortlandt. Children : Esther, bap-     tized September 18, 1797; James Kronkite,  born August 25, 1791, baptized in 1793; Anne,  born September 12, 1794; Elizabeth, February  6, 1796; Henry, May 18, 1798; Isaac, of whoni  further.   (\ I) Isaac, son of Abraham and Catherine  (Kronkite) Depew, was born at Peekskill,  New York, about 1811. He spent most of his  life caring for the estate which his paternal  ancestor purchased from the Indians more  than a hundred years before. He was a re-  spected citizen of Peekskill, and took a con-  siderable interest in the affairs of the town.  He married Martha, daughter of Chauncey  Root Mitchell, a distinguished lawyer. Her  mother was a daughter of Judge Robert John-  stone, for many years senator and judge, who  owned Lake Mahopac and a large estate about  it. Mrs. Depew vi'as a granddaughter of  Rev. Josiah Sherman, brother of Roger Sher-  man, a signer of the Declaration of Inde-  pendence. Rev. Josiah Sherman was a cap-  tain in the Seventh Connecticut Regiment,  Continental Line, and three of his brothers  were also in the patriot army ; they were  descended from Captain John Sherman, an  English army officer, who was born in Ded-  ham, county Essex, in 161 5. Another of Mrs.  Depew's ancestors was Rev. Charles Chaun-  cey, first president of Harvard College.   (VII) Hon. Chauncey Mitchell Depew, son  of Isaac and Martha (Mitchell) Depew, was  born in Peekskill, Westchester county. New  York, April 23, 1834. He was fitted for col-  lege at Peekskill Academy, and in 1852 en-  tered Yale College in what was in after years  known as the 'Famous Class of '56.' Of  the nine members of the supreme court of  the United States, the highest tribunal in the  nation and the aspiration of every lawyer,  were two members of this class, Henry Bill-  ings Brown and David Josiah Brewer. Mr.  Depew was graduated from Yale in 1856; he  received his A. M. degree in due course, and  in 1887 was given the honorary degree o^  LL.D. The following year he was elected a  member of the Yale Corporation, which posi-  tion be held for twelve years.   Immediately after leaving college he threw  himself heart and soul into the canvass in sup-  port of Fremont and Dayton, the first presi-  dential and vice-presidential candidates of the  newly formed Republican party, and made     420     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     speeches throughout the country in support  of the proposition that it was the right and  duty of congress to prohibit slavery and  polygamy in the territories. In 1858 he was  elected a delegate to the Republican state con-  vention, and has since been a delegate in that  body to every succeeding convention, except  two, up to and including 1912. He was one  of the four delegatcs-at-large from the state  of New York to the Republican National con-  vention of 1888-92-96-1900-04, and a delegate  to six other national conventions. In 1861  he was elected to the legislature from the  Third Westchester District, was re-elected in  1862, and became chairman of the committee  on ways and means, and leader of the house;  for most of the time he also acted as speaker  pro tern. In 1863 he headed the Republican  state ticket as candidate for secretary of state,  and was elected. In 1866 President Johnson  appointed Mr. Depew United States minister  to Japan. His confirmation by the senate im-  mediately followed, but after holding the place  in advisement for a considerable time, he de-  clined the position for family reasons. In  1872 he was candidate for lieutenant-governor  on the Liberal Republican ticket, but failed  of election. In 1874 he was elected by the  legislature, regent of the University of the  State of New York, and held the position for  thirty- four years. He was elected by the  Alumni of Yale University a member of the  corporation and held the office for twelve  years. He was also one of the commissioners  to build the capitol at Albany. In 1881 Mr.  Dcpevv was a candidate for senator, following  the resignations of Senators Roscoe Conkling  and Thomas C. Piatt. After the fifty-sixth  ballot, in which he received the largest num-  ber of votes of his party, he withdrew to se-  cure the election of two senators. In 1882  he was offered the senatorship, but declined  for business reasons. In 1888 he received  the unanimous support of the state of New  York for the presidential nomination, and re-  ceived ninety-nine votes in the Republican  national convention. General Benjamin Har-  rison was nominated, and after his election  he offered Mr. Depew every position in his  cabinet, excepting that of secretary of state,  which he had ])romised to Mr. Blaine, or, if  he preferred, any mission abroad which he  might select, and all of which he declined.     In 1894, on the resignation of Mr. Blaine as  secretary of state. President Harrison ten-  dered that position to Mr. Depew and this  was also declined. In 1899 Mr. Depew was  elected United States senator for six years,  and was re-elected in 1905. He has as a can-  didate for United States senator received the  ballots of the members of his party in the  state legislature more often than any other  citizen of the United States, namely sixty  ballots, one each day for sixty days in 1881,  and sixty-four during forty-five days in 191 1.  Mr. Depew has a world-wide reputation as  a public speaker and has been the orator on  many occasions of national importance. He  was the orator selected to deliver the oration  at the Centennial Anniversary of the inaugura-  tion of the first President of the United States;  of the organization of the legislature of the  state of New York ; of the capture of Major  Andre ; at the dedication of the Bartholdi  Statue of Liberty in New York harbor; at  the opening of the World's Fair in Chicago  in honor of the four hundredth anniversary  of the discovery of America by Columbus;  and the opening of the great fairs at Omaha,  Nebraska, and Charleston, South Carolina.  He made the nominating speeches for Harri-  son in the national convention in 1892, and  for Roosevelt in 1904. His last notable poli-  tical speech was in advocacy of the re-election  of President Taft, in 1912. His numerous  addresses have been collected and jniblished  in a work of eight volumes. Justin McCarthy,  in his Reminiscences, in regard to after dinner  speakers, and giving the first rank to Charles  Dickens, says : 'I do not quite know whom  I should put second to him ; sometimes I feel  inclined to give James Russell Lowell that  place, and sometimes my mind impels me to  give it to Mr. Lowell's countryman, Mr.  Chaunccy Depew.'   While Mr. Depew's highest reputation  throughout the country is as a stateman and  orator, his life has been crowded with pro-  fessional and business activities. He was ad-  mitted to the bar in 1858. In 1866 he became  attorney for the New York & Harlem Rail-  road Company, and in 1869, when that road  was consolidated with the New York Central  & Hudson River railroad, with Commodore  Vandcrbilt at its head, Mr. Depew was chosen  attorney for the new corporation and elected     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     421     a member of the board of directors. As the  V'anderbilt railroad system expanded, Mr.  Depew's interests and duties increased in a  corresponding degree, and in 1875 he was ap-  pointed general counsel of the entire system,  and elected a director of the roads of which  it was composed. On the resignation of Mr.  Vanderbilt from the presidency, Mr. Depew  was made second vice-president, and in 1885  he was advanced to the presidency of the  New York Central & Hudson River railroad.  He held this office for thirteen years, during  which period he was president also of six  other railroad companies in the allied system,  and was director in twenty-eight additional  lines. On his resignation from the presidency  in 1898 he was elected chairman of the board  of directors of the New York Central & Hud-  son River railroad, the Lake Shore & Michi-  gan Southern railroad, and the New York,  Chicago & St. Louis railroad, which position  he now holds.   Mr. Depew was president of the St Nich-  olas Society for two years, and of the Empire  State Society of the Sons of the American  Revolution for a number of years ; and of the  Yale Alumni Association of New York for  ten years ; for seven years president of the  Union League Club, a longer term than ever  held by any other, and on declining further  election he was made an honorary life mem-  ber ; is a member of the New York Chamber  of Commerce ; the Society of the Cincinnati ;  a Master Mason of Kane Lodge of Peekskill.  and holds the thirty-third degree in the An-  cient and Accepted Scottish Rite, in the Val-  ley of New York; the Huguenot Society; the  Metropolitan Club, the Century Club, the  Holland Society; the New England Society;  the Colonial Wars Society ; the American Bar  Association ; the New York Bar Association ;  the Westchester County Bar Association ; the  Republican Club ; the Lotos Club ; the Players'  Club ; the Transportation Club ; the Lafayette  Post ; the University Club ; the Phi Beta  Kappa Club and the Psi Upsilon Club. In  W^ishington, D. C, he is a member of the  Metropolitan Club ; the Chevy-Chase Club ;  the Alibi Club; the Country Club and the  University Club; is also a director in many  financial, fiduciary and other corporations.  Now in his eightieth year, he is as vigorous  and active in business affairs, as a political     and after-dinner speaker, and in the manifold  duties of social life, as in any period of his  career.   He married, in 1871, Elise, daughter of  William Hegeman, of New York. She died  in 1892. Of this marriage was born a son,  Chaunccy M. Depew, Jr. Mr. Depew mar-  ried (second) in 1901, May Palmer.     The ancestry of the Ruston   RUSTON family leads to England. John  Ruston, son of W'illiam and  Amey (Bonfield) Ruston, was born at Chat-  teris, Cambridge, England, March 18, 1808,  and died at No. 114 East Twenty-second  Street, New York City, January 25. 1886.   Although not a college graduate, he was  a man of unusual mental culture and ability.  He was a great reader, and acquired a large  fund of general information. Prior to De-  cember 8, 1841, the time of his coming to  this country, he was engaged in business in  London, as a merchant, and for many years  following his arrival here he was engaged in  business in New York City. He was, how-  ever, during the greater part of his life en-  gaged in religious and philanthropic work.  For nearly forty years he was connected with  the New York City Mission and Tract So-  ciety as a worker and officer, and while not  an ordained clergyman, yet for some years  he was the chaplain of the Womans' Hospital,  the Presbyterian Home, and other philan-  thropic institutions in the metropolis, besides  officiating at Evangelical meetings and fre-  quently serving as a supply for churches with-  out a pastor.   He was fond of writing poetry, for which  endeavor he possessed much talent, and wrote  a large number of pieces, mostly of a religious  character, many of which compositions were  printed, and some of them having been set  to music were sung upon anniversary occa-  sions of the church and Sunday school. He  was a Presbyterian by faith, and for about  thirty years, prior to his death, was a member  of the Madison Square Presbyterian Church  of New York City.   |ohn Ruston married twice, having six  children by the first wife and two by the sec-  ond.

He received his primary education in both  private and public schools, principally at the  school of the Collegiate Reformed Dutch  Church of New York City. This was fol-  lowed by a course of study in a law office,  meanwhile attending the lectures given by the  New York University. He was admitted to  practice law in New York City, May 30, i860,  and has continued to follow his profession in  the metropolis from that time on. He began  in a painstaking and thorough manner, and  hence has succeeded in being chosen as the  counsel for many prominent firms and corpor-  ations.   He was a director of and the counsel  for the German American Real Estate Title  Guarantee Company of the City of New York,  and has been a trustee of and the counsel for  the Greater New York Savings Bank of     Brooklyn Borough, from its organization in  1897 to the present time.

(The Monteath Line').   (I) The progenitor of this family in Amer-  ica was Peter Monteath. He belonged to a  Scottish family of honorable Scottish records  and he exhibited in his character a great many  of the better traits of the best class of his  countrymen. He was born in Dunblane, Scot-  land, in 1745, and died at his home in Albany,  New York, November 6, 1797. He married,  while in Scotland, Christian Bishop, who was  born in that country in 1743, died in Albany  April 22, 1806.   (II) Captain George Monteath, son of Peter  and Christian (Bishop) Monteath, was born  in Dunblane. Scotland, February 2, 1778, died  in Albany, March 10, 1856. He gained a wide  reputation throughout the state by his busi-  ness, for he conducted a transportation line  on the Hudson river, for both passengers and  freight, in which he employed a large number  of sailing vessels, and for years the major  portion of all the transportation going from  New York to the west at the time of its open-  ing up, passed by way of his lines. Finally  steam power supplanted the slower form of     424     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     progress, and he was among the first to adopt  it. He was shrewd, according tu the manner  of a Scotchman, and it is not remarkable that  he succeeded in accumulating wealth. When  De Witt Clinton accomplished the opening of  the Erie canal, although a small affair com-  pared to what it was destined to become, he  was among those who founded wdiat was called  the Albany and Canal Line of Tow Boats.  Captain George Monteath married Harriet  Lansing Van Wie, born in Albany, April 7,  1785, died there, October 8, i860, daughter  of William and Jannetje (Lansing) Van Wie  (see Van Wie IV).

(HI) Peter (2), son of Captain George and  Harriet Lansing (Van Wie) Monteath,  was born in Albany, New York, October 30,  1811, and died there, January 13, 1879. He  took up the business of his father, remaining  in Albany throughout his life, and left an  honored name. With James A. Wilson, in  1833, he founded the wholesale grocery house  of Wilson & Monteath, which developed to  so great an extent that Joseph D. Badgley  was admitted in order to increase capital. Mr.  Wilson retired in 1850, and the firm was then  known as Monteath & Badgley, and in 1864  Mr. Monteath admitted his son, George, the  firm style then becoming Monteath, Badgley  & Company. It was a great misfortune to  the father that his son died in 1865, because  he was attached to him more so than most  parents are, and about the same time Mr.  Badgley withdrew and went to New York,  hence he associated himself with his other  son. Edward W. Monteath, so it was that the  firm continued until 1873 as Monteath & Son,  when Egbert M. Tracy was admitted. In  1876 the second son died, and the firm existed  after that as Monteath & Company, until the  death of Mr. Monteath in 1879. He had been  a most capable head of one of the most im-  portant fimis in that part of the state, and  held a name respected by everyone with whom  he had dealings either in business or of a     personal nature, in fact, a quarter of a century  later, mention of the name was wont to bring  to the mind of the younger generation a man  of business success and integrity. While ever  willing to assist in civic movements, he cared  not for political preferment or office of any  description, aside from those directly in his  path, such as being a director of the Com-  mercial Bank and of the Commerce Insurance  Company ; trustee of the Albany Gallery of  Fine Arts ; elder of the Second Dutch Re-  formed Church, and when he died was the  oldest member of St. Andrew's Society of  Albany.

The familv name of  VAN VECHTEN Van Ve'chten was   originally applied to a  family which dwelt in the sixteenth century  near the Vecht river, in Holland, and those  who departed from there to reside in other  localities were accordingly designated 'van  Vechlen.' It was there that they were living  in the year 1600. The name in this country  was originally, or quite as commonly spelled  \'an \'cghtcn. for so it is to be found signed  to many imjMrtant documents until after rev-  olutionary days, as well as in family records,     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     427     wills, deeds and Bibles. As this family  migrated early to Beverwyck (Albany), one's  attention is called to the spelling (Van Vegh-  ten) found in the minutes of the Committee  of Safety.   The Van Vechten arms : Shield — sable, a  fesse battled counter embattled and cotised  argent. Crest — issuing out of a ducal coronet  a pair of eagle's wings erect; dexter wing  sable ; sinister, argent. The arms thus de-  scribed were borne by Teunis Dircksen Van  Vechten, of Vechten, Province of Utrecht,  Holland, prior to 1638. The fesse crossing  the shield signifies a military belt of honor  conferred by the monarch for some special  deed of valor, and the battlements show it  to have been given in the defense of an attack  upon a fortress of great strength.   (I) Teunis Dircksen Van \'echten was the  progenitor of the family in America, arriving  at New Amsterdam in 1638. He was the son  of Dirckse Van Vechten, who in turn was the  son of Dirck (or Richard) Van Vechten, that  is, Richard who dwelt beside the Vecht river.  He came to America in the sailing vessel  known as 'Arms of Normandy,' bringing  along his wife, a child, and two servants to  work for him.   He acquired land along the Hudson river  at the southern end of what was called Green-  bush, now Rensselaer. Columbia county, New  York, almost opposite the City of Albany.  This was in 1648, and he cleared the tract for  farming purposes. His piece of property was  situated north of that occupied by Teunis  Cornelissen Van Vechten, who had succeeded  to the farm of Michaelse Jansen, in 1646. The  soil was found wonderfully arable, and he ac-  cumulated some means, so that to judge by  his associates and the marriages of his children  into good families, he held a good position  among the inhabitants. Children: i. Dirck  Teunise ; married Jannetje Michaelse Vrelant.  J. Cornells Teunise; married (first) Sara Salo-  niense Goewey, in 1668; married (second)  Annatje Leendertse ; married (third) Maria  Lucase, July 3, 1689, widow of Jacob Claase.  3. Gerrit Teunise ; married (first) Antje Janse ;  married (second') Greetje Volckert, daughter  of Volckert Jans Douw. 4. Pieterje ; married,  in 1663, Myndert Frederickse Van Yveren.   (H) Dirck Teunise Van Vechten, eldest  child of Teunis Dircksen Van Vechten, was     born on his father's estate at Grecnbush New  York, and died at Catskill, Greene county  New York, November 25, 1702. His will was  signed April 4, 1687, and was probated March  30, 1703.   His children spelled his surname 'Van  Veghten,' and his Christian name 'Thunisse,'  in many public documents. He resided at  Grecnbush during his youth, but on October   20, 1681, he purchased from Stcphanus Van  Cortlandt a tract of valuable land in Catskill  (then Albany county), which was confirmed  by a. patent under the hand and seal of His  Excellency, Governor Thomas Dongan  Province of New York, bearing date March   21, 1686. He dwelt upon this land, but after  his death it was made over to his sons, Samuel  and Johannes, by the other brothers, Michael  and Abraiiam, by deed dated March 30. 1715,  and then by deed of August 9. 1721. Johannes  made over his share to Samuel. When Sam-  uel Van Vechten made his will, at Catskill,  September 3, 1739 (he died without issue  March 30, 1741), he declared that he possessed  all the premises described in these deeds, and  he devised them to his nephew, Teunis Van  Vechten, the second son of his deceased  brother, Teunis, the latter having died in 1707.   Dirck Teunise Van Vechten married fan-  netje Vrelant. She was the daughter of  Michael Jansen and Fytje Hartman, of Com-  munipaw. New Jer.sey. Children: i. Jannetje,  i)orn September 25, 1660. 2.

(HI) Teunis Van A'echten. son of Dirck     428     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Teunise and Jannetje Michaelse (Vrelant)  Van Vechten, was born at Albany, New York,  May 24, 1668, and died in 1707. He resided  for a time at Loonenburgh, later known as  Troy, New York.   He married, at Schenectady, New York, No-  vember 28, 1694, Cathlyntje (or Catherine)  Van Petten, who was born in Albany, and  was the daughter of Claas (or Nicholas)  Frederickse Van Petten (born May 30, 1641,  died October 3, 1728), who took up residence  in Schenectady in 1664, and married Aeffie  De Vos, who died January 23, 1728, aged  seventy-eight years.

(IV) Teunis Van Vechten, son of Teunis  and Cathlyntje (Van Petten) Van Vechten,  was born April i, 1707, and died at Catskill,  New York, April 3, 1785.   He had been brought up by his uncle. Sam-  uel Van Vechten, at Catskill, who had prac-  tically adopted him when his father died the  same year as his birth, and for that reason  provided well for him in his will, as follows :  'It is my will and I do order that at my de-  cease the second son of my brother, Teunis  Van Veghten (deceased), namely, my nephew,  Teunis \'an Veghten, who hath been under  my care from his childhood and now abiding  with me, shall hold, use, occupy, possess and  enjoy all my lands at Catskills, wherein I am  now in tlie possession and enjoyment of, with  all the houses, out-house, grist-mill, barns,  barracks, orchard garden, with all and singular  the appurtenances to the premises belonging  or appertaining and all other my real estate  wheresoever and of what nature or kind so-  ever, for and to the whole and sole use, bene-  fit and improvement of him, the said Teunis  Van \'eghten, for and during his natural life  time, and no longer without impeachment for  waste.   'It is my will and I do bequeath and order  that at the decease of him, the said Teunis Van  Veghten, the before mentioned estate shall     come into the full possession and enjoyment  of the right heir or heirs of him, the said  Teunis Van Veghten, lawfully begotten of his  own body, and thence to descend from the  said lawful heir of him, the said Teunis Van  Veghten, to his heir lawfully begotten of the  preceding heir, successively, to the end of the  world. * * *   'I give and bequeath to my said nephew,  Teunis Van Veghten, his executors, admin-  istrators and assigns forever, all my house-  hold goods, furniture, utensils and implements,  namely : Beads, beading lining, woolen, iron,  brass, puter, wooden-ware, waggons, slays,  plaughs, harrows, plate, cash, money, and  moneys worth in hand or owing to me, together  with all my personal chattels as negro slaves,  male and female, horses, cows, sheep, swine,  poultry, with all and every other part of my  moveable and personal estate wheresoever,  and whatsoever none excepted.'   Teunis Van Vechten married, at Kingston,  New York, January 9, 1742, Judike Ten  Broeck, daughter of Jacob Ten Broeck, of  that place. Children: i. Samuel, born Sep-  tember 28, 1742, died February 12, 1813: mar-  ried, in 178 1, Sara Van Orden. 2. Jacob,  born September 18, 1747, died April 30, 1806;  married, January 21, 1787, Elsie Staats. 3.  Teunis Teunissen, born April 24, 1749, died  December 7, 1817; married Elizabeth De  Wandelaer. 4. Elizabeth, born October 6,  1757, died February 17, 1813; married, June  2, (or 9th), 1782, Hezekiah Van Orden. 5.  Abraham, born December 5. 1762. See for-  ward.   (V) Abraham \'an X'echten, son of Teunis  and Judike (Ten Broeck) Van Vechten, was  born at Catskill, New York, December 5, 1762,  and died at Albanv, New York, January 6,   He became a distinguished lawyer and  statesman. Few men of his locality have been  called to so extensive a sphere of usefulness  and filled it so long and well. He received  his elementary education at a public school  in Esopus, New York, where many other  distinguished men had been trained in the  classics. He then pursued his professional  studies under the direction of the late Chan-  cellor John Lansing, and first practiced law  in Montgomery county ; but saw superior op-  portunities in Albany, where his family had     SOUTHERN NEW Y(3RK     429     had its start, so moved there and opened an  office. There were a number of brilliant  barristers there at this period, but tiieir  brilliancy could not cast shadow upon the ef-  forts of Mr. Van Vechten, for he soon ranked  among his illustrious seniors as an equal and  a strong competitor for highest honors. Un-  tiring in his efforts, the powers of his highly-  gifted mind were continuously developed and  expanded. His intellect was formed to grapple  with the most abstruse and difficult of judicial  investigations, and he early inured himself to  the most intense application of mental in-  dustry.   Munsell's famous 'Albany .A-unals' say of  him: 'In acuteness and the ready comprehen-  sion of any subject presented for his investi-  gation, he had few equals, and nature seemed  to have furnished him with powers eminently  adapted to the illustration of legal principles.  He made no display of legal lore, his learning  seemed to be incorporated with his thoughts.  What he had once read was well digested and  remained ever ready for application. A large  portion of his life was spent in the discussion  of legal questions in our highest tribunals of  law and equity ; there he was always listened  to with profound attention by our most  eminent judges. His arguments were cal-  culated to elucidate and instruct, and greatly  to aid the tribunals to which they were ad-  dressed, in forming correct conclusions. His  style was remarkable for purity, perspicuity  and strength. His train of thought was un-  impassioned, yet earnest and forcible. His  talents were too conspicuous to allow him to  confine his efforts to the bar. He was re-  peatedly chosen to represent his fellow citizens  in both branches of the Legislature. The  Senate Chamber was the theatre of some of  his highest intellectual efforts. As a member  of the court for the correction of errors, he  has left behind him enduring monuments of  his legal wisdom.'   For a number of years he filled the office  of attorney-general with distinguished ability.  At an early period of his life, a seat on the  bench of the Supreme Court was offered to  him by Governor John Jay ; a similar offer  was made to him at a later period. He de-  clined these proffered honors, preferring the  labors of the bar as more congenial to his  habits and feelings. The causes in the books     of reports, in which he took part as counsel,  numerous as they are, give but a faint idea of  the amount of professional labor performed  by him. For more than half a century his  brilliant mind was constantly shedding its  light over the jurisprudence of the state. The  bar had long delighted to accord to him the  highest honors it could bestow. To the  younger members of the profession he had  greatly endeared himself by his kindness and  courteous manners, and by all he was vener-  ated as an illustrious model of professional  excellence.   In Mr. Van Vechtcn's daily consulations  with his clients, he was emphatically a peace-  maker. It was his constant habit' to advise  the settlement of disputes whenever it was  practicable. He allowed no .sordid motives  to influence his advice nor to bias his mind  in giving his opinions. His character as a  citizen in the private walks of life afforded a  model of excellence. Ilis disinterestedness  vvas a prominent feature, and was the founda-  tion of that unbounded confidence which was  reposed in him. In his domestic circle he was  remarkable for kindness and for the attention  bestowed upon the feelings and wants of those  dependent upon him.   He was recorder of the City of Albany,  from 1797 to 1808; State Senator, from 1798  to 1805. and from 1816 to 1820; Member of  Assembly, from 1805 to 1816; Attorney-Gen-  eral for the year 1810; reappointed in 1813,  when he served two years, and was a prom-  inent and influential member of the Constitu-  tional Convention of 1821.   .'\braham Van Vechten married, at Albany.  A^ay 20, 1784, Catharina Schuyler. She was  born at Albany. March 23, 1766, died there,  September 10, 1820, and was the daughter of  Philip Pieterse Schuyler (born at Albany,  April 22, 1736, died there.

(IX) Arthur Livingston Van Vechten, son  of Arthur and Harriette Stevens (Clarkson)  Van Vechten, was born at Brooklyn. New  York, February 4, 1887. He was educated at  the Pingry School, Elizabeth, and is now in  business with his father.   He married, at Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania,  October 12, 1912. Rev. George Colvert Carter  officiating. Miss Henrietta Troth Townsend.  who was born at Bryn Mawr, October 21,  1887. She was the daughter of Henry Troth  Townsend, born at Philadelphia, Pennsylva-  nia, October i, 1849; died at Bryn Mawr,  Pennsylvania, September i, 1906, and his  wife, Maria Potts, who was born at Martie  Forge, Pennsylvania, November 6, 1850.     (H) Johannes Blauvelt,  BLAUVELT third son of Gerrit Hen-  dricksen Blauvelt (q. v.),  was baptized April q, 1659, in the First Dutch  Church of New York, and spent his early life  on Manhattan Island, He was among the  purchasers of land at Tappan and was one  of the first settlers in that district, where most  of the children of his second marriage were  baptized. He was a member of the Tappan  church at its organization, October 24. 1694,  was a deacon in 1693 and 1701, and was one  of the five who gave ninety-seven acres of  land to that church. He was still living in  1729. The New York church records show  that Johannes was married, October 24, 1683,  to Jannekin Jochems, a young woman from  Middlewout. Their children, baptized in New  York, were: Maritze, February 23, 16S5;  Gerrit. November 21, 1686; Jochem, March  18, 1688; Isaac, mentioned below. The death  of the mother of these children is not re-     corded, and neither is the second marriage  of Johannes Blauvelt. His second wife,  Catrina Cornelisse, must have been the daugh-  ter of one Cornelius, but a diligent search of  the records of New York, Tappan and Hack-  cnsack fails to disclose the baptism of any  Catrina, daughter of a Cornelius. She may  have been born on the other side of tlie ocean.  Among the first baptisms at Tappan was that  of their son Cornelius, October 25, 1694. The  next child, Abram, was baptized December  13, 1696, at Hackensack, and there recorded.  Other children were: Margrietje, born Feb-  ruary 5, 1699; Johannes, October 15, 1701;  Jacobus, baptized April 11, 1703 (aged three  months); Lena, born January 17, 1705; Ra-  chel, October 16, 1706; Katryna, October 9,  1708; Elizabeth, July 27, 1710; David, March  10, 1712; Sarah, May 6, 1714.   (Ill) Isaac, third and youngest son of Jo-  hannes and Jannekin (Jochems) Blauvelt, was  baptized November 16, i6()o, in New York,  and resided in the neighborhood of Tappan,  where his first children were baptized. He  married, at Tappan, October 14, 1714, Eliza-  beth Meyers, born June i, 1695, at Tappan,  daughter of Johannes and Annetje (Jedense)  Meyers. Children : Johannes, mentioned be-  low ; .Annatie, Augu.st 27, 1716; Abraham,  December 3, 1719; Jannetje, April 16, 1722,  baptized at Tappan ; Catharyne, born October  17, 1725, baptized at Hacken.sack ; Cornelius,  mentioned below; Abram, born April 15,  1729: Daniel, May 3, 1732; Mariclie, Sep-  tember 9, 1734; Elizabedt, June 8, 1737; Isaac,  March 5, 1740, all baptized at Tappan.   (IV)\Tohannes (2), eldest child of Isaac  and Elizabeth (Meyers) Blauvelt, was born  December 8. 1715, at Tappan. and resided  there. He married, about 1738. Grietje Smidt,  probably a daughter of Gerrit and Brcchie  (Haring) Smidt, born July 21, 1719. bap-  tized August 2. following, at Hackensack.

Following this they re-  moved to the town of Ramapo, but none of  their children are recorded at the brick church  in that town. The family records show that  they had also daughters, Maria and Caroline,  and son, .Alexander.   (VH) Alexander, son of John and Catrina  (Talama) Blauvelt, was born in January,  1807, at Spring Valley, baptized October 4,  of the same year, at Kakiat church. By oc-  cupation he was a merchant tailor, residing  at Nyack, where he died February 9, 1894,  at the age of eighty-seven years. He was  long an active member of the Dutch Reformed  church at Nyack, in which he served as dea-  con and elder, and politically was a Democrat.  He married, January 12, 1833, Catherine Van  Antwerp, who died .September 23, 1889. Chil-  dren : Lawrence Salisbury, Wilmar Ostram,  William Ellis, married Frances Outwater at  Tappan ; Edwin.

(VI) Cornelius, third son of Joseph and  Hannah (Demorest) Blauvelt, was born June  12, 1775, in Ramapo, baptized thirteen days  later at Clarkstown, and died June 12, 1858,  probably in Ramapo. He married, at the  Kakiat church, November 4, 1796, Bridget  Talman. Children : Joseph C, mentioned be-  low ; John, born August 21, 1801 ; Cornelius,  August 20, 1808: Abraham C. J., December  18, 181 1 ; Tunis: Nicholas C.   (VH) Joseph Cornelius, eldest child of Cor-  nelius and Bridget (Talman) Blauvelt, was  born November 8, 1798, in Ramapo, died  June 5. 1883, in that town. He married. May  12, 1821, Rebecca Remsen, born June 20,  1803, in Ramapo, died there, April 21, 1885.

(VIII) Margaret, second daughter of Jo-  seph Cornelius and Rebecca (Remsen) Blau-  velt, twin of Isaac Remsen, became the wife  of Sylvester Westervelt, of Ramapo (see  Westervelt VII).   (IV) Cornelius, second son of Isaac and  Elizabeth ( Meyers) Blauvelt, was born March  I, 1727, and baptized April 13, of the same  year, at Tappan. He probably lived in what  is now the town of Harrington, Bergen  county. New Jersey, but very little concern-  ing him is of record. He married, August 9,  1752, at Tappan, Margarie, born at Newtown,  Long Island, daughter of John and Geertie  (\\'iltsee) Ryker, of Newtown, and later of  Closter, New Jersey. John Ryken or Ryker     SOUTHERX NEW YORK     433     was an early settler at Closter, where he was  a large farmer, and it is probable that Cor-  nelius Blauvelt lived near him. Only one bap-  tism in his family can be found in the rec-  ords of New York, Hackensack, Schraalen-  burg or Tappan. Happily this baptism suf-  fices to continue this line of descent.   (V) Isaac Cornelise, son of Cornelius and  Margarie (Ryker) Blauvelt, was born August  9, 1755, and baptized August 17, at Tappan.  He died before November iS, 1802, when his  widow married Johanis Van Houten. He  married Lena Cornelisse, who was probably  the daughter of Cornelius Cooper and Dirckje  Smidt, born 1730. Their children, baptized  at Tappan, were : Cornelius. December 7,  1777: Nicholas, mentioned below; Margrietje,  March 9, 1789; Catrina, November 23, 1791.   (VI) Nicholas, second son of Isaac Cor-  nelise and Lena (Cornelisse) Blauvelt, was  born June 13, 1782, and baptized at Tappan,  July 7, following. He resided at Blauveltville,  north of Tappan, where his father had lived  before him for some time, and later settled  at Spring Valley, in Rockland county. He  was a farmer, a member of the Dutch Re-  formed church, and politically a Democrat.  He married Hester Graham and they had  children : Cornelius, Isaac, John Nicholas,  mentioned below ; Daniel, Catherine. Eleanor.  Sarah.   (VII) John Nicholas, third son of Nicholas  and Hester (Graham) Blauvelt, married Eliz-  abeth Haring, and they were the parents of  Sarah Eleanor Blauvelt, wife of Edwin Blau-  velt (see Blauvelt VIII).     This name has been traced to a  DODGE remote period in England, and   has been very widely distributed  over the United States, beginning with the  earliest settlement of the New England col-  onies. It has been distinguished in law and  letters, in divinity, in war, in politics and in  every leading activity of the human family,  and is still identified with the progress of  events in New England and other states. It  has turned out from Harvard nineteen grad-  uates, from Yale a dozen, from Dartmouth  ten, from Columbia College eight. Union Col-  lege six, Andover Theological Seminary five.  Bowdoin College five, University of Wiscon-  sin five, Brown University three, Colby Uni-     versity three, Williams College two and Mid-  dlebury College one. The records of the  Colleges of Heraldry in England show that  a coat-of-arms was granted to Peter Dodge,  of Stockworth, county of Chester, in 1306,  and later a patent to John Dodge, of Rotham,  in the county of Kent, in 1546. It is declared  that he was descended from Peter Dodge, of  Stockworth. The name is found frequently  in various sections of England, and in the  sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there were  Dodges of honorable character and connection  in the counties of Cheshire, Kent, Norfolk  and Downs. On the nth of May, 1629,  there sailed from the harbor of Yarmouth,  England, the 'Talbot,' a vessel of three hun-  dred tons, and the 'Lion's Whelp,' a neat  and nimble ship of one hundred and twenty  tons, and they arrived at Salem. Massachu-  setts, on the 29th of the June following. This  marks the arrival of the first of the tame of  Dodge in America.   (I) John Dodge and his wife, Marjorie,  resided in Somersetshire, England, where the  following children were born to them, namely:  William, Richard, Michael, Mary. An ex-  amination of the parish registry of East  Coker, Somersetshire. England, discloses the  records of the births of these children. It is  also learned that Richard Dodge was in 1633  a duly admitted tenant by entry hold of land  in Helyar Manor in East Coker, that this  manor came into the possession of its then  owner about 1616, and that Richard came  there from St. Badcaux, Devonshire, about  four miles from Plymouth, in that year.   (II) Richard, son of John and Marjorie  Dodge, ancestor of a very large progeny scat-  tered throughout the United States, appeared  at Salem, Massachusetts, as early as 1638,  and 'desired accommodations.' It is shown  by the records of East Coker, in England,  that he resided and came from there. As  immigrants were admitted to the colonies only  by applying to the town and obtaining leave,  it is probable that Richard and his family  came in if>38, and it is also probable that he  left Englancl without royal permission. After  living for a while on the land of his brother  William, he settled on 'Dodge Row' in North  Beverly, not far from Wenham Lake. The  house which Richard Dodge built was near  the present north line of Beverly. He evi-     434     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     dently gave his attention chiefly to farming.  He was a loyal church member and one of  the most liberal contributors to the support  of the gospel. He and his wife were mem-  bers of the VVenhani church before 1648, un-  der the pastorate of John Fiske. He was also  interested in the progress of education, and  his name appears first in a list of twenty-one  subscribers to Harvard College in 1653, while  the next largest sum was one-fourth as much  as his. The cemetery of 'Dodge Row' is on  land which he dedicated for that purpose, and  this grant was subsequently conferred by his  grandson. He died June 15, 1671, leaving an  estate valued at one thousand seven hundred  and sixty-four pounds and two shillings, a  very considerable property for that time. He  gave to each of his three sons a good farm  valued at over one hundred pounds. He  made liberal provision for annual payments  by the sons to the support of their mother.  His wife's name was Edith and she survived  him seven years, dying June 27, 1678, at the  age of seventy-five years. The inventory of  her estate indicates that she was possessed of  considerable properly. Their children were:  John, Mary, Sarah, Richard, Samuel, Edward,  Joseph.   (HI) Richard (2), second son of Richard  ( I ) and Edith Dodge, was born in Beverly,  Massachusetts, in 1643, died in Wenham,  April 13, 1705. He was a farmer and lived  in the south part of Wenham. He also owned  a large farm in Ipswich, which he gave to  his eldest son Richard, and had land near  Chebacco Lake in Ipswich. He owned a cider  mill and press, and from the careful provision  for its use, which he made in deeds to his  sons, it would seem that they all lived in the  same vicinity. About two years before his  death he divided his property among his chil-  dren, giving his 'negro man' Mingo to the  eldest son. On the 31st of May, 1705, Rich-  ard, Daniel, William and Mary joined in a  deed of four and one-half acres of marsh  land in 'Chebacco,' Ipswich, to John and  Martha Davidson to carry out what they al-  leged to be the purpose of their father. He  marrietl, February 23, 1667, Mary Eaton, born  1 64 1, died November 28, 17 16, aged seventy-  five years. He and his wife were buried at  North Beverly, where their gravestones still     remain. Their children were : Richard, Mary,  Martha, Daniel, William.   (IV) Daniel, second son of Richard (2)  and Mary (Eaton) Dodge, was born April 26,  1677, in Wenham, Massachusetts, where he  died April 30. 1740. He graduated from  Harvard College in 1700, being the first col-  lege graduate of the name in New England,  and seems to have given some time to teaching.  Records show that he was engaged to teach  at Beverly in 1703 and again in 1706, and it  is presumed that he taught there continuously  between these dates. In 171 5 he was engaged  as schoolmaster of Reading for a period of  three years at thirty pounds per year. He  received from his father deeds of a large  amount of land, dated December i, 1703, in-  cluding the father's dwelling house, another  dwelling house in the same yard, a cider mill,  the homestead lot in Wenham, amounting al-  together to fifty acres, and more than seventy-  seven acres included in four parcels, and an  island. The gift also included the father's  common rights in Wenham and Manchester,  one-third of his marsh in Chebacco, a negro  boy, one hundred and ten trees, and other  items. The real estate records show that  Daniel bought and sold much real estate, and  he left a long will, providing for the disposal  of much pro]>erty. He was a deacon of the  Wenham Church. He married, June 20. 1706,  Joanna Hurnham, born March 18, 1689, in  Ipswich, daughter of James and Mary Burn-  ham. She married (second) June 3, 1741,  Samuel Kimball, who died January 27, 1745,  and she married (third) September 17, 1747,  Captain Henry Ilcrrick. She died after Octo-  ber 7. 17(')7. on which date she made her will.  Children of Daniel Dodge: Joanna, born July  17, 1707: Daniel, September 15, 1710; James,  baptized November i, 1713: Joshua, born De-  cember 26, 1716; Mary, August 25, 1719;  David, mentioned below.   (V) Da\id. youngest child of Daniel and  Joanna (Burnham) Dodge, was born March  7, 1723, in Wenham, Massachusetts. He re-  sided for some years in Ipswich hamlet. About  1750 he sold considerable real estate in and  about W'enham, and settled soon after at  Lebanon, Connecticut. Through his generous  nature and lack of attention to business de-  tails, he suffered great losses in property. He  received a commission as a soldier in the old     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     435     French war, and was drowned about 1756  while going over Otsego Falls in New York,  in a bateau, en route to Canada. The whole  party perished by the capsizal of the boat.  Letters of administration upon his estate were  granted November 11, 1756, and it was re-  ported as insolvent December 15, following.  The inventory was made January 17, 1757.  He married, December 5, 1741, Anna Low,  born December 22, 1719, died April 3, 1782,  at Amherst, New Hampshire. A guardian  was appointed for her two children, and she  went to Pomfret, Connecticut, where she kept  a school fifteen years, boarding in the family  of General Putnam. Her last years were spent  with her son in Amherst. Children : David,  mentioned below; Samuel, born August 18.   1744-   (VI) David (2), senior son of David (i)  and Anna (Low) Dodge, was born October  10, 1742, in Wenham, Massachusetts, and  reared in Connecticut. He learned the wheel-  wright's trade, and for some time resided in  Brooklyn, Connecticut, later settling on a farm  in the adjoining town of Hampton, where he  lived, respected and much esteemed, and died  August 24, 1807. He married Mary (Stuart)  Earl, a widow, born June 29, 1735, and sur-  vived her husband nearly nine years, dying  April 4, 1816. on the farm in Hampton.  Children: Mary, born May 10, 1770; David  Low, mentioned below.   (VH) David Low, only son of David (2)  and Mary (Stuart-Earl) Dodge, was born  June 14, 1774, in Brooklyn, Connecticut, died  April 23, 1852, in New York City. In early  life he was a teacher at Norwich, Connecticut,  and in 1802 engaged in the dry goods busi-  ness in Hartford, same state. In 1807 he re-  moved to New York, and some years later  lived for a time in Norwich, returning again  to New York in 1825. He became an eminent  merchant in the metropolis, noted for his  contributions to religious and benevolent  work. He was one of the founders of the  New York Peace Society and its first presi-  dent, and a founder of the New York Bible  and New York Tract Societies. He was the  publisher of several works on religious sub-  jects, and in 1832 served as United States ap-  praiser at New York. He married. June 7,  1798, Sarah, daughter of Rev. Aaron Cleve-  land, born June 11, 1780. Her brother was     the grandfather of the late President Cleve-  land. Children : Julia Stuart, born March 28,  1799, in Norwich; Sarah Cleveland, March  10, 1801 ; David Stuart, July 14, 1803, in  Hartford; William Earl, mentioned below;  Mary Abiah, September i, 1808; Elizabeth  Clementina, December 18, 1810; Susan Pratt,  July 3, 1813, in Norwich.   (VIII) William Earl, junior son of David  Low and Sarah (Cleveland) Dodge, was born  September 4, 1805, in Hartford, Connecticut,  died February 9, 1883, in New York City. He  attended school in New York, Norwich and  Mendham, New Jersey, and was distinguished  as a boy for his unselfish and kindly nature.  An earnest reader, he was brought up under  strong religious influences, and in his seven-  teenth year, in May, 1822, united with the  Congregational church of Bozrah, Connecticut.  He became clerk in a store connected with a  mill at that place, of which his father was  superintendent, and when eighteen years of  age was accustomed to purchase the entire  stock of the store in New York. In 1825 he  accompanied his father to New York and be-  came the latter's assistant in a dry goods store  on Beekman Street. In 1827 with a man  named Huntington, he established a wholesale  dry goods business on Pearl Street, which was  a success. In 1833 he joined the fimi of  Phelps & Peck, which then became Phelps,  Dodge & Company, importers of metals, whose  establishment was maintained on CliflF Street,  New York, for more than fifty years. Mr.  Dodge became early interested in timber lands  and the manufacture of lumber in Pennsylva-  nia, Michigan. Georgia and other states, and  his firm, which was extensively engaged in  the importation and manufacture of copper,  became largely interested in the Lake Superior  mines of that metal. Mr. Dodge was one of  the founders of the Lackawanna Iron & Coal  Companv, of Scranton, Pennsylvania, and for  many years gave much of his attention to the  management of the Oxford furnace in New  Jersey, where car-wheels and later nails were  manufactured. He was also interested in iron  and steel works in Illinois and Virginia. The  firm of Phelps. Dodge & Com()any passed  through severe periods of financial panic with-  out a stain upon its record. In 1855 Mr.  Dodge became a member of the New York  Chamber of Commerce, was made its first     436     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     vice-president in 1863, became president in  1867, and continued in that position until 1875.  He served on many important committees  during the civil war, was active in forming  the International Relief Committee for re-  lieving distress in England caused by the civil  war, and was among the foremost in promot-  ing relief for French sufferers after the war  of 1871. He was one of the first directors  of the Mutual Life Insurance Company of  New York, a trustee of the Atlantic Life In-  surance Company, a director of the New York  Bowery Insurance Company, of the United  States Trust Company, and the United States  Telephone Company, which later became a  part of the Western Union system. He was  one of the original subscribers to secure the  construction of the Atlantic cable. For ten  years, following 1853, he was in charge of  the large estate of Anson G. Phelps, which  was managed with credit to himself and ben-  efit to the heirs. Interested in the welfare of  his employees, he was for many years an of-  ficer of the Mercantile Labor Association, was  a Hfe member of the New York Historical  Society from 1857, and aided the Metropolitan  Museum of Art and the American Museum  of Natural History, to each of which he be-  queathed five thousand dollars by will.   The influence of Mr. Dodge was always  cast on the side of right and progress, and  he was active in the Citizen's Association,  whose object was the securing of honest and  eflficient government for the city. At a meet-  ing at Coo])er Institute, May 3. 1870, presided  over by Peter Cooper, Mr. Dodge was one  of the speakers in indignant remonstrance  against proposed laws, detrimental to the pub-  lic schools. He became early interested in  the development of railroads and was a di-  rector of the New York & Erie railroad from  1839 to 1851. He was interested in various  properties, now a part of the Lackawanna  railroad system, was for thirty years a di-  rector of the Central railroad of New Jersey,  seven years president of the Houston & Texas  Central railroad, and interested in various  railroad properties in the south and west. He  was one of the first subscribers to the stock  of the New York Elevated railroad, but on  account of his opposition to the operation of  Sundav trains, he withdrew from all connec-  tion with that and with the Erie and Jersey     Central railroads, disposing of his stock. Al-  ways interested in the welfare of his native  land, in early manhood he afifiliated with the  Whig party, and supported Henry Clay for  president in 1844. He opposed the annexa-  tion of Texas, the extension of slavery, and  the reduction of the tariff', and warmly aided  the efforts to make Kansas a free state in  1856. He was a delegate to the peace con-  gress held at Washington in February, 1861,  and V. hen the efforts of this organization were  found to be futile, he gave his hearty support  to the policy of President Lincoln. In 1864,  without seeking the nomination, he was elected  to represent the eighth New York district in  the national congress, and was compelled to  pass through a bitter contest before securing  his seat. In 1872 he was a presidential elector,  aiding in the choice of President Grant and  \'ice-President Wilson. Mr. Dodge was a  most liberal contributor to various charities,  and at the time of his death his annual con-  tributions totaled one hundred thousand dol-  lars. When the Dodge Family Association  met at Salem, Massachusetts, in July. 1879,  he took a warm interest in the preparation of  the family genealogy, offering to hear one-  fifth of its cost, and became treasurer of the  publication committee. In 1885 a beautiful  bronze monument to his memory was erected  at the intersection of Thirty-fourth Street,  Broadway and Sixth Avenue, whose cost was  borne by the voluntary subscriptions of three  hundrcci and eighty persons. The bronze fig-  ure rests upon a handsome granite pedestal,  in which is a drinking fountain, commemo-  rative of his temperance principles.   He married, in New York, June 24. 1828,  Melissa Phelps, born March 3. 1809, in Hart-  ford, daughter of .Anson Greene and (Olivia  (Eggleston) Phelps. She survived him.

(IX) William Earl (2). eldest child of  William Earl (i) and Melissa (Phelps)  Dodge, was born February 15, 1832, in New  York City. He was delicate as a boy, and     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     437     his education was chiefly suppHed by private  instruction. On attaining manhood he be-  came a partner in Phelps, Dodge & Company,  of which estabHshment he became the head,  succeeding his father. While occupied with  large business cares, he gave much attention  to philanthropic and social work. During the  civil war he was an officer of the Loyal Pub-  lication Society, and was an advisory director  of the Women's Central Association of Re-  lief, an outgrowth of the United States San-  itary Commission. He was one of the com-  missioners of the state of New York under  the allotment law, his commission being one  of the first signed by President Lincoln.  Among the founders and active members of  the Protective War Claim Association, he did  much for the relief of discharged soldiers and  received the thanks of the legislature of the  state of New York by joint vote for his serv-  ices in this connection. Mr. Dodge was among  the founders of the Union League Club and  the Young Men's Christian Association, and  was several years president of the latter or-  ganization. During his incumbency of that  position the first building for the exclusive  use of the association was erected. He was  president of the Evangelical Alliance for the  United States, and a liberal contributor to  many religious and charitable works. Among  the institutions which he aided largely in es-  tablishment were the Metropolitan Museum  of Art, the American Museum of Natural  History, and the New York Botanical Gar-  dens, and he served on the executive commit-  tees of all these establishments. He was in-  terested in many enterprises, serving as trustee  of the New York Life Insurance Company  and the Atlantic Mutual liisurance Company,  and a member of the Chamber of Commerce.  He married, April, 1854, Sarah, daughter of  David Hoadly, of New York, who was presi-  dent of the Panama Railroad Company.

(X) Cleveland Hoadly, second son of Wil-  liam Earl {2) and Sarah (Hoadly) Dodge,  was born in i860, in New York City, where  most of his life has been spent. He gradu-  ated at Princeton College in 1879, and imme-  tliately entered business life as a member of  Phelps, Dodge & Company. He is a director  of the City National Bank and of the Farm-  ers' Loan & Trust Company, and has been  president of the Young Men's Christian As-  sociation of New York, being also interested  in other social and beneficent organizations,  lie married Grace, daughter of Henry Parish,  of New York. Children: Elizabeth Wain-  wright, born August, 1884; Julia Parish, Au-  gust, 1886; Cleveland Carl and Bayard, twins,  February, 1888.     Jean de (Jallatin, who, at the  GALLATIN outbreak of the French rev-  olution, was second in com-  mand of the regiment of Chateauvieux, in the  service of Louis XVL, maintained that the  Gallatins were descended from A. Attilius  Gallatinus, consul in the years of Rome, 494  and 498; in support of this article of faith  he fought a duel with the Baron de Pappen-  heim on horseback with sabres, and as a con-  sequence ever afterwards carried a sabre cut  across his face. A gap, however, of fifteen  hundred years elapsed between the last con-  sulship of the Roman Gallatin and the earliest  trace of the modern family found in a re-  ceipt signed by the Abbess of Bcllaconiba for  Quindecim libras Vienncnscs bequeathed to  her convent by 'Dominus Fulcherius Galla-  tini, miles,' in 1258. Faulcher Gallatin left no  other trace of his existence, but some sixty  years later, in 1319, a certain Guillaume Gal-  latini. Chevalier, with his son, Humbert Galla-  tin, Damoiseau, figured dimly in legal docu-  ments, and Humbert's grandson, Henri Gal-  latin, Seigneur de Granges, married Agnes de  Lenthenay, whose will, dated 1397. creating  her son Jean Galatin her heir, fixes the local  origin of the future Genevan family. After  the elevation of Geneva to the rank of a sov-  ereign republic in 1535. the history of the  Gallatins is the history of the city. The fam-  ily, if not the first in the state, was second to     438     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     none. Five Gallatins held the position of first  syndic, and as such were the chief magistrates  of the Repubhc. Nor did the Gallatins restrict  their activity to civil life. There were few  battlefields in Europe where some of them  had not fought, and not very many where some  had not fallen. One of the branches of this  extensive family was represented in the mid-  dle of the eighteenth century by Abraham  Gallatin, who lived on his estate at Fregny,  and his wife, Susanna Vaudenet, whom he  married in 1732. They had a son, Jean, born  in 1733, who married, in 1755, Sophie Al-  bertine' Rolaz du Rosey, of RoUe. They had  two children — a boy, to whom they gave the  name of Abraham Alphonse Albert Gallatin,  and a girl about five years older. The boy,  later known as Albert Gallatin, became one  of the most distinguished of American public  financiers, and the founder of the New York  family bearing his name.   (I) Abraham .'\lphonse Albert Gallatin, bet-  ter known as Albert Gallatin, was born at  Geneva, Switzerland, January 29, 1761, died  at Astoria, Long Island, August 12, 1849.  After graduating from the Academy of Ge-  neva in 1779, he and a friend, Henri Serre,  came to the United States and spent a year  at Michias, Maine, in trade pursuits, with lit-  tle success. Gallatin then moved to Boston,  where he supported himself by teaching  French, and in July, 1782, received permis-  sion to give instruction at Harvard College.  In the following year he explored and invested  in lands on the west frontier, and in 1784  established a country store in Lafayette  county, where he was conspicuously active  in opposition to the Federal excise law, and  where also the basis of his report was laid  by his report of the committee of ways and  means in the session of 1790-91. In Febru-  ary, 1793, he was elected to the United States  senate and took his seat December 2, but the  following February the senate decided, by a  party vote of fourteen to twelve, that he did  not possess the proper qualifications as to  citizenship, it having been less than nine years,  the time prescribed by the constitution, since  he had taken the oath of citizenship and alle-  giance to the state of Virginia. Gallatin was  active at the time of the Whiskey Insurrec-  tion, and although he urged submission to the  law and the refrainment from all improper     and illegal acts, nevertheless he went so far  in his relations with the insurrectionists as to  give himself, boili then and later, considerable '  political embarrassment. He was at the end  of the trouble elected to the Pennsylvania  assembly, and from 1795 to 1801 was a mem-  ber of congress, where he allied himself with  the Republicans who, under the leadership of  Madison, were opposing the administration of  the Federalists. 'In his first term,' says his  biographer, Stevens, 'he asserted his point  and took his place in councils of his party.  In the second he became its acknowledged  chief. In the third he led its forces to final  victory.' He served on the important com-  mittees and steadfastly opposed the adminis-  tration, especially in the matter of the Jay  Treaty, the increase of the army and navy,  and the relations with France. Particularly  did he attack the administration of finances,  a field with which his pamphlets showed him  to be familiar, and his services and ability in  this direction were recognized by Jefferson,  who in 1801 made him secretary of the treas-  ury, a post which he held until 1813. During  these years a marked reduction was effected  in the national debt, the practice as to appro-  priations was made more systematic, the sink-  ing fund was improved, and the preparations  were made which rendered war and an in-  crease of the national debt possible without  a disorganization of the public financial sys-  tem. Gallatin also rendered important serv-  ices in the negotiations which were concluded  by the Treaty of Ghent. Of his services in  this connection one of his biographers, Henry  Adams, has said : 'Far more than contem-  poraries ever supposed or than is now ima-  gined the Treaty of Ghent was the sjiecial  work and peculiar triumph of Mr. Gallatin.'  Then, after declining a nomination to congress  and an opportunity to resume charge of the  treasury department, he became minister to  France, filling the post from 1816 to 1823.  Three years later he went to London as min-  ister, remaining one year and concluding two  important conventions. He had been nomi-  nated for the vice-presidency by the Crawford  Republicans in May. 1824, but withdrew in  October to make room for Clay, and in 1843  he declined to enter Tyler's cabinet as secre-  tary of the treasury.   After the conclusion of his dii)lomatic serv-     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     439     ice he removed to New York (in 1828) and  that city remained his permanent residence  until his death. He was president of the Na-  tional Bank there for some years, but his  duties were light and he had ample time for  study and public service. He was much in-  terested in the problems of public education  and of finance, and took an active part in the  movement which resulted in the founding of  New York University, but his chief interest  appears to have been the study of ethnology,  especially of American ethnology. He found-  ed the American Ethnological Society in 1842,  which for a brief period was a very service-  able agency for the promotion of such studies,  and he wrote several valuable essays and mon-  ographs on ethnological subjects. He did not  lose his interest in finance and industry, how-  ever, and in every way gave an example of  scholarship and of public spirit rarely sur-  passed by any one in this country. He pub-  lished in 1796 'A Sketch of the Finances of  the United States,' and in 1843 memoirs on  the 'American Rights to the Northeastern  Frontier' and many minor essays on finance,  history and ethnology, his 'Synopsis of Indian  Tribes Within the United States, East of the  Rocky Mountains,' and in the 'British and  Russian Possessions in North America'  (1836) and his 'Notes on the Semi-Civilized  Nations of Mexico, Yucatan, and Central  America, with Conjectures on the Origin of  Semi-Civilization in America' (1845) being  especially noteworthy. His writings are of  great value in the study of the political his-  tory of the United States in the first part of  the nineteenth century.   He married (first) in 1789, Sophie Allegre,  who died within a few months of her mar-  riage; married (second) in 1793, Hannah,  whose death shortly preceded his own in 1840.  daughter of Commodore James Nicholson, of  the United States navy. James Nicholson  was born in Chesterfield, Maryland, in 1727,  and came of ancestors who settled in that lo-  cality a century before. His father had a  grant of what was called Nicholson's Manor  and was in the official employ of the British  government. James Nicholson went into the  navy at the outbreak of the revolution, com-  manded the 'Defense' in 1775, was made  ranking captain by resolution of congress in  1776, became commander-in-chief of the navy     in 1777, commanded the frigate 'Trumbull'  in the battle with the 'Wyatt' in 1780, and  in 1 78 1 was taken prisoner and held until the  close of the war. Returning to civil life, he  settled in New York and remained a resident  of this city until his death in 1804. Children  of Albert Gallatin: James, born October 18,  1796; Albert R,, mentioned below: Frances,  born 1802, married Byan K. Stevens.   (H) Albert R., second son of Abraham Al-  phonse Albert and Hannah (Nicholson) Gal-  latin, was born in New York in 1800. fie was  liberally educated and was graduated from  Princeton College. Although he was admitted  to the bar in Pennsylvania, he practiced only  a short time and then removed to New York  and engaged in financial pursuits. At one  time he was in business with John Jacob  Astor and his ventures were generally profit-  able, so that he was able to accumulate a con-  siderable fortune. He was the companion of  his family a great part of the time, and in  consequence v^-as thrown into association with  people of public note. He went abroad with  his father several times, to France in 1816,  to Great Britain in 1826, and upon other  occasions. On these trips he made the ac-  quaintance of many eminent Europeans and  became the personal friend of the Duke of  Wellington and of many of the leaders in the  French Revolution. He lived until 1890, a  connecting link between this generation and  the deeds and the men of the infant days of  the Republic. He married, in 1837, Mary L.,  daughter of Horatio Gates and Elizabeth Lu-  cille (Rhinelander) Stevens. Children: Al-  bert Horatio, born 1839; Frederic, mentioned  below : James, born 1846.   (Ill) Frederic, second son of Albert R.  and Mary L. (Stevens) Gallatin, was born  in New York in 1841. He was graduated  from the New York University in 1861 and  was educated as a lawyer. He is a member of  the Union, University, Century, Badminton,  Tuxedo. .4rmy and Navy, and New York  Yacht clubs, and he belongs to the Sons of  the Revolution. St. Nicholas Society, Society  of Colonial Wars, and the Society of the War  of 1812. His interest in scientific matters is  indicated by his membership in the .American  Geographical Society. He is also an enthu-  siastic yachtsman and devotes a considerable  time to the sport.     440     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Frederic Gallatin married Almy Goelet,  daughter of Thomas R. and Hannah G. (Goe-  let) (ierry. Children: Almy Goelet, married  George P. Cammann ; Rolaz Horace, born  1 87 1, married Emily L. Morris; Goelet, born  1877, married Edith E. Post; Albert, born  1880, married Margaret H. Hackstaff; May,  married W. W. Hoppin.     The family name was Pott in  POTTS ancient times; in 1278 it appears  among parliamentary writ : 'Rob-  ertus atte Potte, of county Surrey,' as serv-  ing in military duty. At that period it was  not infrequently written Potte. Regarding  the arms of the Potts family, the earliest rec-  ord in the Herald's College of Arms granted  to one of the name bears date 1583; given to  John Potts, an eminent barrister of Lincoln's  Inn. It is described : Azure, two bars or,  over all a band of the second, that is, on a  shield of blue are two bands of gold, making  in all five horizontal bands of equal width,  with the blue showing at top and bottom, and  from u]i])er left to lower right a band of same  width of gold. Crest: On a mount vert, an  ounce sejant ppr. collared and chained.   (I) The line of descent of the Potts family  here to be set forth was instituted by David  Potts, who was born about 1670, in Montgom-  eryshire. Wales. He was a Friend, and set-  tled in Bristol township, Philadelphia county,  Pennsylvania, where he died in 1730. It is  thought he came when a youth, the first notice  of his residence in Ainerica being 7 mo. 24,  1692, when signing as a bondsman for Eliza-  beth Bennett, as executor of Edmund, her late  husband, and his signature may be seen on  file in the register's office in Philadelphia.  Pennsylvania As a Friend he first belonged  to the Philadelphia Monthly Meeting. He  purchased in 1695 a tract of one hundred and  fifty acres of land in Bristol township, Phila-  delphia county. Pennsylvania, near German-  town; subsequently selliiig fifty acres, settling  on the balance, and there resided the remain-  der of his life. The deed for this first pur-  chase in the Potts family reads as follows :  'The Commiss'rs by Patent dated 2('>th q mo..  1685. Granted 500 acres to Rob't Longshore.  Purchaser in Bristol Township, in the County  of Philad'a. jovning in Germantown. Irenia  Land, and Will'm Wilkins, of which deed     dated ist 4 mo., 1686, he sold to Samuel Ben-  nett 200 acres, who by Deed dated 2.4. 1695,  sold 150 thereof to David Potts, who sold to  Will. Harnian 50 acres now in Possession of  Peter Clever.' And further: 'The said Da-  vid Potts requests a Warr't of Resurvey on  the said 150 acres according to the True  bounds of the Tract and to Cutt olY 50 a's to  said Harman or Clever. Ordered that a  Warr't be accordingly granted for the said  50 acres to be cutt off as by agreement made  between them and a Patent on the Return if  required, they paying the Overplus, if any.'  In 1716 he had a grant of one hundred acres  of land in the Manor of Springfield, for which  he was to pay £80. When the Friends es-  tablished a ^Ieeting in (iermantown. he was  transferred to it, and under date October 11,  171 1, he bought land there, the sellers being  trustees of the Germantown Meeting there,  and he was entrusted with important matters  relating thereto. He was a man of good  standing in the community where he resided  for so long a time, and represented Philadel-  phia county in the provincial assembly for  1728-29-30. His death occurred November  16, 1730. He made his will November 13,  1730, which was probated November 26, 1730,  and is on file in the register's office at Phila-  delphia, in will Book E, page 142. In it he  wrote: 'I Give & Bequeath to my son, John,  the sum of Twenty Shillings money af'd he  having likewise received his portion in my  life time w'ch s'd money is to be paid to him  in two years after my Decease.'   David Potts married Alice Croasdale, who  was born 8 mo. 3, 1673, and whose parents  came as passengers with William Penn in the  ship 'Welcome,' Robert Grcenway, master,  in 1682. Although the records of the Meet-  ing are far from perfect, many matters relat-  ing to this couple are ascertainable. She was  the youngest daughter of Thomas and Agnes  (Hathernwaite) Croasdale. They declared  their intention of marriage with each other  before the Philadelphia Monthly Meeting 10  mo. 29, 1693 (December, 1693); passed the  Meeting the second time on 11 mo. 26, 1693-4  (January, i6()4), and were granted a certifi-  cate to marry under the care of Middletown  Monthly Meeting in Bucks county. The fol-  lowing is a copy of the entry in the minutes  of the latter Meeting: 'David Potts and     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     441     Alice Croasdale have requested to solemnize  their marriage within this Meeting, because  her relations mostly dwell here, and they be-  longing to Philadelphia have brought a Cer-  tificate from that Monthly Meeting that testi-  fies they have proceeded there orderly, and  nothing is found against them, and also re-  quested that they may accomplish their mar-  riage here, which they have granted them;  so this Meeting is satisfied and grants their  request.' A subsequent record shows that  they were married in an orderly manner on  I mo. 22, 1693. This date, according to the  modern system of reckoning, would corre-  spond to March 22, 1694. The following is  a copy of the marriage certificate as it is re-  corded by the Monthly Meeting: 'Whereas,  David Potts and Alice Croasdale, both of  Philadelphia, in the Province of Pennsylva-  nia, having declared their intentions of taking  each other in marriage, before several public  meetings of the People of God called Quakers,  in Philadelphia, in the Province of Pennsylva-  nia aforesaid, in America, according to the  good order used amongst them, whose pro-  ceedings therein, after deliberate consideration  thereof, were approved by the said meetings ;  they appearing clear of all others.' Children:  I. Thomas, born 3 mo. 27, 1695; married Ra-  chel James. 2. John, see forward. 3. Daniel,  born 2 mo. 19, 1698. died in 1728; married  Sarah Shoemaker. 4.

Stephen,  born II mo. 20, 1704-5, died in 1758; married   Anne . 8. Rebecca, born 11 mo. 16,   1705-6; was living in 1730. 9. Ezekiel, born  I mo. 30, 1708, died in 1781 ; married (fir.st)  Magdalen Miller; married (second) Barbara  Vodges, a widow. 10. Nathan, died in 1754;  married Esther Rhoads.   (11) John, son of David and Alice (Croas-  dale) Potts, was born 8 mo. 8, 1696, and died  in September, 1766. He learned the trade of  a millwright. When grown up he settled in  Upper Dublin township, later on included  within the limits of Montgomery county,  where he purchased a tract of land from  Isaac and John Phipps, about 1748, the deed  for which is recorded in Philadelphia, Penn-  sylvania, showing title back to the original     grant by William Penn, in 1681 ; still owned  ( 1900) by his descendants. It is located about  two miles east of Fort Washington village.  His will, made September 28, 1766, in many  respects is quaint and reads in part as follows :   'Be it remembered that I, John Potts of the Town-  ship of Upper Dublin, in the County of Philad'a and  provmce of Pensilvania, Mill Wright, being now far  advanced in Years, but yet of Sound and Disposing  Mind and Memory, for which mercy and favour  May I ever prais the great author of my being, and  at times feeling the Simtoms of Mortality through  the Decay of nature, but relying on the merits of  my Redeemer, hope for a happy change from this  life to that which is to come of Eternal Peace, and  rest in Daily Kxpectation of such a Change. .And  in as much as God in his Mercy has blessed me with  some worldly estate, do think Proper to make this  my last will and testament in the manner following,  that is to say, first of all I will that all my Just  Debts and funeral Expenses be well and truly paid  and Discharged.   'Item, I will Devise and Bequeath unto my Dear  and Loving wife Elizabeth all my Real and Personal  Estate whatsoever during her natural life, giving her  full Privilege to will or dispose of as much house-  hold goods as she shall see proper in her life time  to either her Children or grand Children and after  her decease. I will Devise and Bequeath unto my  son John the Plantation & Tract of land 1 now live  on containing one hundred and lifty acres of land,  be it more or less with all the Buildings and appur-  tenances thereon or any wise thereunto belonging  unto him his heirs and .Assigns forever and the re-  mainder of my Personal estate except what is here-  after Excepted he paying the several legacies here-  after mentioned that is to say, — I will and Bequeath  unto my son Thomas my Chamber Clock and fifty  Pound Lawful money of Pensilvania to be delivered  and paid unto him by my Executors hereafter named  within one year after my wife's Decease.'   John Potts married, in July, 1726, Eliza-  beth McVaugh (or McVeagh), daughter of  Edmond McVeagh and Alice Dickinson. She  was born in 1699 and died i mo. 5, 1791. Their  children were: John, died in 1808, married  Hannah Davis; Thomas, see forward; Eliza-  beth, died 9 mo. 24, 1758, married Isaac  Shoemaker.   (Ill) Thomas, son of John and Elizabeth  (McVeagh) Potts, was born in 1729, died  inly 29, 1776. He was a millwright, and  resided in Moreland townshi]) for some time.  Walter Moore and his wife, Saraii, on June  22, 1753, conveyed to him, as millwright of  the Manor of Moreland, one-half of a certain  corn mill and two parcels of land there. Later  on he removed to Sussex county. New Jersey,  settling in Chelsea Forge, where he possessed  much property, became high sheriff of Sussex     442     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     county in 1772, and a member of provincial  assembly in 1775 and 1776. Thomas Potts  was a member of the continental congress  which convened in Philadelphia in 1776; he  was in all respects a patriot, but being a mem-  ber of the Society of Friends he refused to  sign the Ueclaration of Independence, not  wishing to co-operate in an act that meant  war and bloodshed for the colonies. Thomas  Potts married, January 16, 1753, Elizabeth  Lukens, daughter of William Lukens and  Elizabeth (Tyson) Lukens, who, when a  widow, married Dr. John Rockhill, a widower  (born March 22, 1726, died April 7, 1798),  whose descendants (by their previous mar-  riage) intermarried.   The Lukens family was one of the most  notable of the early Pennsylvania families,  and was of Holland descent. Joseph and  John Lukens were brothers-in-law of Thomas  Potts. The first mentioned was a life-long  resident of the Lukens estate, at Sandy Run,  a man of wealth, held in high esteem for  many good qualities. The latter was appointed  to the responsible position of surveyor-general  of Pennsylvania, under the king. Upon the  agitation of the momentous question which  prepared the way for American independence,  he espoused the cause of the patriots and so  closely was he identified with the leaders in  the revolutionary movement that it was in one  of the apartments of his residence, in Phila-  delphia, that the Declaration of Independence  was drawn up by Thomas Jefferson. His  granddaughter, the celebrated beauty, Sally  McKean, becatne the wife of the Marquis  D'Yrujo, the first minister from Spain to the  United .States under the constitution.   The children of Thomas Potts and Eliza-  beth (Lukens) Potts were: i. Elizabeth,  married Robert Barnhill, in 1778, and had :  Elizabeth ; John ; Robert : Margaret, who mar-  ried Cornelius V. S. Roosevelt, and had a son,  Theodore Roosevelt, who married Martha  Bullock, by whom, Theodore Roosevelt, Presi-  dent of the United States. 2. Joseph, died  unmarried, aged about sixty years. 3. Gainer,  married John Clayton Rockhill. and had:  Thomas C. Robeson, Lukens, John, Edward  Augustus, William. 4. William Lukens, born  July 17, 1771, died January 17, 1854; married  Rachel Hughes. 5. Hugh Henry, see forward.   (IV) Hugh Henry, son of Thomas and     Elizabeth (Lukens) Potts, was born in 1773,  and died in 1842. One gains an excellent  idea regarding him from a description in a  iCtter written to Thomas Maxwell Potts, the  skilled and intelligent genealogist of the Potts  family, by the late William John Potts. It  reads :   'This summer I have renewed my acquaintance  with Mr. George H. Potts, of the City of New York.  He is. as you are aware, first cousin to my father,  and is now seventy-four years old, — a tall, distin-  guished and elegant looking man of at least six feet  high, not inclined to stoutness, which characterizes  two of his sons. .Among Mr. George H. Potts' tra-  ditions of his father, uncles and grandfather, were  several which are confirmed in part by my aunt,  (Hannah) Elizabeth Potts and my uncle, Charles  Clay Potts, both aged above seventy years. Hugh  Potts, as he was commonly called, though his full  name was .Mexander Hugh, father of the said  George, and brother to my grandfather, was a re-  markably handsome man. One of the Robesons who  had known him in his youth, possibly an old sweet-  heart of his, said he was the handsomest man she  ever knew. The said Mary Robeson died in Phila-  delphia, aged about seventy years, ten or more years  ago. Hugh Potts was six feet one inch high;  weighed 220 pounds, and was a most pow-erful man.  On one occasion he lifted with one hand fourteen  56-pound weights to above the knee. He held on  his outstretched hand one Ramsay, sheriff of Hunter-  don county, in a standing position, he being steadied  by a man on each side; took him eiUircly across  the room. He also carried said Ramsay, standing  on his (Mr. Potts') knee, the back part of it turned  up, across the room. Mrs. Rockhill, sister of Hugh  Potts, was also of large frame. She was six feet in  height. Thomas Potts, high shtriflf of Sussex  county, N. J., father of Hugh Potts, on one occa-  sion had to arrest Edward Marshall, the hero of  the famous Indian walk, who lived on an island  in the Delaware, out of his jurisdiction, and was  beside no mean adversary. My. great grand-  father, Thomas Potts, a large and powerful man,  took a boat and crossing over to the island where  I^farshall lived, bound him hand and foot, and  when he landed his prisoner on the Jersey shore,  served his warrant on him.'   Hugh Henry Potts married Elizabeth  Hughes, about the year 1800, at Carlisle.  Pennsylvania. .She was the daughter of Cap-  tain John Hughes, a distinguished officer of  the revolution, who enlisted as a sergeant in  the Sixth Pennsylvania Battalion, January 29,  1776, and served in various capacities to the  close of the war. His position of brigade  quartermaster during the years 1778 and 1779  brought him in close personal companionship  with (General George Washington. Hugh  Henry Potts also inclined to a military career  and near the close of the war of 1812 was     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     443     appointed to a captaincy in the United States  army. Their children were: i. EHzabeth  Hughes, born April 15, 1801 ; married Ed-  ward Augustus Rockhill, by whom: William  Potts Rockhill, and Gainor Rockhill, who  married Edward Van Cleif. 2. Thomas, born  February 5, 1803. 3. Sarah Ann, born May  5, 1805. 4. John Hughes, born March 28,  1807. 5. William L., born May 2, 1809. 6.  George Alexander Henry, see forward.   (V) George Alexander Henry, son of  Hugh Henry and Elizabeth (Hughes) Potts,  was born September 22, 181 1, died in New  York City, on April 28, 1888. He was born  on his father's estate on the Delaware river  in Bucks county, Pennsylvania. Bereft of his  mother by death in 18 13, he found a home  in Pittstown, Hunterdon county, New Jersey,  in the family of his father's sister, Mrs. Judge  Rockhill. In 1829 he removed to Pottsville,  Pennsylvania, and at once engaged in mining  operations, and from 1834 to 1845 was the  most extensive individual coal operator in the  region. He erected the first engine for min-  ing coal below the water level ever set up in  Pennsylvania ; he also built the first boat which  was employed to convey coal from the Schuyl-  kill region direct to New York City. In 1853  George A. H. Potts removed to New York  City and became the head of the New York  branch of the wholesale coal and iron firm  of Lewis Audenried & Company. C^n the  death of Mr. Audenried in 1874 this firm  was dissolved, Mr. Potts retiring, and the  business has since been continued by his sons,  Frederic A. Potts and William Rockhill Potts,  and still later by his grandson, Frederic A.  Potts. George A. H. Potts was one of the  original incorporators of the National Park  Bank, and its president from September, 1879,  to the time of his death in 1888. In person  he was above the medium height and of strik-  ing personal appearance.   On September ig, 1832, he married Emily  Dilworth Gumming, at Pottsville, Pennsylva-  nia. She was the daughter of George M.  Cumming. who was born March 15, 1813, and  died in 1857. On July 2, 1863, he married  his second wife, Helen Blendina Hard. She  was born at Albion, New York. October 17,  1837. and was the daughter of Judge Gideon  Hard. George A. H. Potts resided on Madi-  son avenue. New York Citv, and had a sum-     mer home and farm at Somerville, New Jer-  sey.

Dallas, vice-president  of the United States in 1844; Mary Dallas  died in 1852; there were no children. George  C. Potts married his second wife, Laurette  Eustis, at Philadelphia, on December 4, 1863.  She was the daughter of Alexander Brooks  Eustis and Aurore (Grelaud) Eustis, and was  born at Milton, Massachusetts, January 14,  1845, and died at Pottsville, Pennsylvania.  November 4, 1868. George C. Potts was en-  gaged in coal mining operation at Locust  Dale, in Schuylkill county, Pennsylvania, op-  erating what is known as the Potts Colliery,  in 1852, later sold out to the Philadelphia &  Reading Railroad Company, and after the  civil war was in the stock brokerage business  in Philadelphia as partner in the concern of  R. Ellis & Company. Later he was appointed  coal sales agent for the Philadelphia & Read-  ing railroad for the Northern New York and  Canadian district, with headquarters at Roch-  ester, New York, where he now resides  (1912). There were four children: i. Maud  Eustis, born April 3, 1865 : married at Belle-  fonte, Pennsylvania, to Augustus G. Paine Jr.,  April 8. 1890. ii.

(VT') Hon. Frederic Augustus Potts, son  of George A. Henry and Emily Dilworth  (Gumming) Potts, was born at Pott.sville,  Pennsylvania. April 4, 1836. and died at New  York, New York. November 9, 1888. He  was long identified with the coal and iron  business in New York City and controlled a  very extensive business as a coal merchant.  He was a member of the senate of New Jer-     sey from Hunterdon county in 1874. and in  1878 was the Republican candidate for the  Fourth New Jersey district, known as the  'Democratic Gibraltar.' He proved his won-  derful popularity by reducing the opposition's  plurality to 1,500. which had formerly been  6.500 votes. In 1880 he was the Republican  nominee for governor of New Jersey, and so  greatly was he respected that he was defeated  by the narrow margin of 651 votes, in a state  then strongly Democratic. He was a person  of remarkably fine physique and presence,  possessed a strong character and was much  liked because of a genial disposition. In New  York City he resided at No. 39 East Thirty-  ninth street, and had a summer home on the  old Potts farm, at Pittstown, Hunterdon  county, New Jersey, and also at Monmouth  Beach, New Jersey.

Children of  Mr. and Mrs. Potts: i. William Brevoort,  born August 19, 1901. 2. Frederic Augustus,  born May 6, 1904. 3. Henry Barnes, born  September 21, 1905. 4. James ♦Barclay, born  October 11, 1908. 5. Robert Maclay Bull,  born March 24, 1910.     This surname has various  NICOLL forms, such as Nichol, Nichols,  Nicholson, nearly all of them  derived from the personal name, Nicholas,  and having an English, French, Gaelic, Ger-  man or Latin origin. Concerning the Eng-  lish Nicoll or NichoUs family one writer says:  'The origin of the ancient family of NichoU,  written at various periods Nychol, Nicol,  Nicoll, Nicholls and Nicholl, has been by anti-  quaries variously and largely treated on. It is  stated that in the time of Edward the Con-  fessor, one Nicholas de Albini, alias Nigell  or Nicholl, came over from Normandy and  was the common ancestor of the Nicholl fam-  ily.' W'hether he was the common ancestor  of the Nicoll family in England may well be  doubted. Nicholas has always been a com-  mon personal name, and Nichols or Nicholson,  meaning the 'son of Nicholas,' is an easily  suggested surname. Is is likely, therefore,  that there was no more a Nichols family than  there was a Smith family, between one Smith  and another there being manifestly no  necessary coimection. As for the Nichols or  Nicholsons of Ireland and Scotland, there are  extant pedigrees and voluminous evidences  showing their origin to be in the main Gaelic.  Nichols in that case was merely a render-  ing of the Milesian MacNiochol. the warrior  Niocholl from whom the surname is derived  being the brother of Tcige, who is ninety-one  on the 'CofTey' pedigree, the Coffeys being  dynasts of chief lords of that jwrtion of the  ancient territory of Corca Luiglie, a territory  inhabited by families of the Lugadian race  in Carbery. OHart in his famous 'Pedi-  grees' has copious notes on the history of  this remarkable clan. The modern Nicoll is  therefore a form of Nichols, and is derived  from the personal name Nicholas, Nicholas-  son, Nicholson, and Nichols, being in the case  of the American family abbreviated to Nicoll.  The Nicoll family took an active and ear-  nest share on the patriot side in the struggle  for American independence. William I-'loyd,  one of the ancestors of De Lancey Nicoll, was  a signer of the Declaration of Independence,  a member of the first continental congress,  and a brigadier-general in the American serv-  ice. He was also a member of the first na-  tional congress, and as presidential elector cast  his vote for lefTerson in 1801. General Na-     446     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     thaniel Woodhull, who commanded the mili-  tia on the battle of Long Island, also an an-  cestor of Mr. De Lancey Nicoll, was a mar-  tyr in our fight for liberty. Taken prisoner  by the Tories, commanded by Colonel Oliver  De Lancey, the latter called upon Woodhull  to shout 'God save the King!' Woodhull re-  fused, and his captors cruelly cut him down  with their swords, the wounds soon after  proving fatal.   (I) Matthias Nicoll, the immigrant an-  cestor of the Nicoll family, was descended  from an ancient and honorable family of Islip,  Northamptonshire, England. His father was  a clergyman of the Established Church of  that time. He was a graduate of Emmanuel  College, as his father and grandfather had  been before him, and was by profession a  lawyer. He came to this country in 1664 as  secretary to the Duke of York's commission  and died at Cow Neck (now Plandome), De-  cember 22, 1687. On the reduction of the  province in 1664 and the organization of the  new government supplanting Dutch rule, he  was appointed by Colonel Richard Nicoll sec-  retary of the colony, and was authorized, ex-  officio, to preside with the justices of the dif-  ferent ridings, in the court of sessions. In  1671 he was chosen mayor of New York, as  successor to Thomas Willet, and after the act  of 1683, for remodeling the court, he was  appointed the first judge of the court of oyer  and terminer, in which capacity he officiated  for the last time in Queen's county, Septem-  ber 12. 1687. He was the author of the first  body of English law put in force in the col-  ony and known as the 'Duke's Laws.' These  laws were more tolerant in matters of reli-  gion than those of New England. He was  a man of superior abilities and of the strict-  est integrity. His purchases upon Cow Neck,  as well as upon Great Neck, were extensive,  the former of which he conveyed to his only  son, William He married Abigail Johns.  Children : William, mentioned below : Mar-  garet, born May 30, 1662, married. May 12.  1686, Richard Floyd, of Setaukct, and died  February i, 1718.   (II) \Yilliam. son of Matthias and .Abigail  (Johns) Nicoll, was born in England in 1657.  died in Mav. 1723. He was educated for the  bar. In 1677 he accompanied Sir Edmund  Andros to England, and on arriving there     joined a regiment of troops, then embarking  for Flanders, and spent some time in the  army. Ill health compelled his return home  two years after, and the journal of his ad-  ventures on the occasion mentioned is still  existing and is a great curiosity. He now  entered on his profession and acquired a high  reputation at the bar of New York. In 1683  he was appointed clerk of Queen's county, and  held the office until June 20, 1688, discharg-  ing its duties the last year by his deputy,  Andrew Gibb, who was appointed his suc-  cessor. He purchased a considerable tract of  land upon Madnan's Neck, called by the In-  days. Wallage, and now Great Neck. His  purchase in Islip, Suffolk county, was made  in 1683, and was confirmed by the patent,  September 20, 1697, including his subsequent  purchases from the Indians. \\'illiam sided  with the revolution in England in favor of  William and Mary, but was decidedly opposed  to the measures of Leisler and his adherents ;  in consequence of which he was imprisoned  with others, his associates, who had the cour-  age and honesty to avow this opinion in  relation to public affairs. In 1691 he was  called to the council, and in 1695 sent to Eng-  land by the assembly to urge the crown to  enforce the contributions allotted to the other  colonies, for the defence of the country  against the French, which fell with unequal  weight upon this colony. He was allowed  for his services on this occasion one thou-  sand pounds. On his passage out he was cap-  tured by a French privateer, and it became  necessary to destroy his papers to prevent  them falling into the hands of the enemy, who,  however, robbed him of three hundred and  fifty pounds in money. Being carried to St.  Malo and imprisoned, he was, after some  months, exchanged and arrived in England.  He was a member of the assembly twenty-one  years in succession, and speaker sixteen years  of that time.   In 1691 William Nicoll was employed to  conduct the prosecution against Leisler and  his associates, and he was also one of the  council employed by Nicholas Bayard in  March. 1702, in his defence against a political  prosecution instituted by Nanfan. the lieuten-  ant-governor, and pursued with all the vio-  lence and liittcrness of party rancor for cir-  culating and signing a petition to the king and     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     447     parliament, in which the abuses of power  by him and his friends were enumerated. He  was also one of the council employed in the  defense of Francis McKemie, a Presbyterian  clergyman, June, 1707, indicted for preaching,  which was brought about by the bigotry of  the governor, Lord Cornbury. Mr. Nicoll  served in the assembly at a period when the  colony was divided into bitter parties, and  when a variety of interesting questions arose  between the governor and the assembly, af-  fecting their rights in the defense of the lat-  ter. Governor Dongan, who was styled lord  of the manor of Martha's Vineyard, Decem-  ber 19, 1685, appointed Mr. Nicoll steward  thereof. In 1707 Giles Sylvester devised all  his lands on Shelter Island to him and made  him his executor, which, with his ijrevious  purchase, made hiin owner of four-fifths of  the said island.   He married, in ' 1693, Anna, daughter of  the patroon, Jergmiah Van Rensselaer, of Al-  bany, and widow of her cousin, Killiaen Van  Rensselaer, the eldest son of Johannes, the  heir-at-law of Killiaen Van Rensselaer, first  proprietor of the manor of Rensselaerwyck,  and Claverack. Children : Benjamin, men-  tioned below ; William, Van Rensselaer, Mary,  Catharine, Frances.   (Ill) Benjamin, son of William and Amia  (Van Rensselaer) Nicoll, was born in 1694,  died in 1724. To this Benjamin the tract of  land in Suffolk county, which his father, Wil-  liam, settled and called Islip Grange, de-  scended. The younger brother of Benjamin,  William, devoted himself to public affairs and  was elected speaker of the colonial legislature  for eighteen consecutive years. He owned  an estate of four thousand acres at Shelter  Island, which he left by his will to his nephew,  William, the son of his brother, Benjamin.  Benjamin Nicoll married, in 1714, Charity,  daughter of Richard Floyd, born April 6,  1692, died 1758. She married (second) Sep-  tember 26, 1725, the Rev. Dr. Samuel John-  son, of Stratford, Connecticut, first president  of King's, now Columbia College, by whom  she had two sons.

He graduated  at Yale College in 1734, and was also educated  for the bar, but his father dying intestate he  got none of the patrimonial estate, and was  of course thrown entirely on his own re-  sources for support. He settled in New York,  and bade fair to stand in course of time at  the head of his profession, when he was cut  off by death at the age of forty-two. He.  however, lived long enough to give abundant  proof of his abilities and usefulness, being one  of the founders, not only of the present city  library, but of King's College, also, of which  his stepfather, Dr. Samuel Johnson, of Strat-  ford, was the first president in 1754.

He graduated from King's College in 1774,  and became a prominent New York merchant.  He married (first) Alice Willet. a niece of  Lieutenant-Governor Colden. and (second')  December 2, 1780, Elizabeth, only daughter of     448     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     General Nathaniel and Ruth (Eloyd) Wood-  hull.

(VIII) De Lancey, eldest son of Solomon  Townsend and Charlotte Ann (Nicoll) Nicoll,  was born at Shelter Island, New York, in  1854. He was prepared for college at Flush-  ing Academy, Flushing, Long Island, and at  St. Paul's School, Concord. New Hampshire.  He then went to Princeton University, gradu-  ating in 1874. From the first he had chosen  the profession of law, and kept that aim in  view throughout his college career. ITpon  leaving Princeton he took a course at the  Columbia Law School, graduating with honor  in 1876. Mr, Nicnll was first associated with  the law office of Julien T. Davies, one of the  leading practitioners of the state. He then     connected himself with the law office of the  noted lawyer, Clarkson A. Potter, brother of  the late Bishop Henry C. Potter, of the Epis-  copal diocese of New York. Having been  admitted to the bar in 1876 and having ac-  quired a practical knowledge of legal pro-  cedure in the offices of the distinguished ad-  vocates already named, Mr. Nicoll, in 1877,  established his own law office. In 1879 he  entered into partnership with Walter D. Ed-  monds, and later joined in organizing the firm  of Eaton, Lewis & Nicoll. Subsequently Mr.  Nicoll became a member of the firm of Nicoll  & Anable, now Nicoll, Anable, Lindsay &  Fuller.   Mr. Nicoll made his way rapidly to the  front of his profession and built up a success-  ful and profitable practice. His clients from  the first were largely from the upper ranks  of the community, and he was called upon for  advice in many noted and difficidt cases. As  assistant district attorney he had charge of  the prosecution of the so-called 'boodle alder-  men,' who were accused of selling their votes  to the promoters of the Broadway surface  railway undertaking. The prosecution of  these notorious exponents of 'graft'' was a  task calling for unyielding integrity, courage,  ability and energy, for the defendants were  backed by powerful influences and abundant  funds. They had the best counsel their money  could command, and they put up a determined  and resolute fight to the legal proceedings di-  rected against them. The Tweed Ring had  owed its exposure largely to the fact that the  stolen money was divided by check among the  guilty participants, and the checks were easily  traced in the books of the Ring bank. The  'boodle aldermen' did not take the checks.  They demanded and received cash, but the  cash was in the form of one-thousand-dollar  bills. Mr. Nicoll had the bills traced to the  bribed and bribe giver, and brought the proof  to the jury as effectively as if checks had  been given. Convictions were obtained, and  Mr. Nicoll became the terror of influential  evildoers who had supposed that their 'pull'  and their cunning would shield them from  punishment.   The conviction of the 'boodle aldermen' led  to a widespread demand for Mr. Nicoll for  district attorney and he was nominated for  that office in 1887 by a combination of law-     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     449     abiding Democrats and Republicans. The  campaign which followed was attended by  some of the worst outrages on the ballot-box  in the history of the city. All the forces of  evil were arrayed against Mr. NicoU, partly  from motives of revenge and partly prompted  by fear. Thugs repeated and' non-voters  thronged to the polls to vote against NicoU,  and money was expended freely to bring about  his defeat. Notwithstanding all this sinister  agitation, he almost gained the majority, the  plurality of his opponent being comparatively  small. It was a Pyrrhic victory for Mr  Nicoll's enemies, and when election time came  again they prudently withheld from a contest,  and he was carried into office by a large ma-  jority.   As district attorney, Mr. Nicoll proved suc-  cessful in some of the most difficult cases that  ever came before a public prosecutor. lie  was quick to detect the evidence of guilt, and  was resolute in bringing the guilty to justice.  At the same time he ever kept in mind the  duty of a public prosecutor to protect the in-  nocent as well as to punish the guilty, and he  was ever willing to temper justice with mercy  when the public interests would not suffer  thereby. Mr. Nicoll brought the district attor-  ney's office to a high degree of efficiency, his  aim being to dispose of all cases coming before  him as promptly as was consistent with a  salutary enforcement of law. He established  a thorough system throughout his office, and  the methods which he adopted' have been  maintained in a large degree by his successors.   Mr. Nicoll was elected to the constitutional  convention of 1894 which revised the state  constitution. He was assigned to the im-  portant committees of the judiciary and on  suffrage, and took a prominent share in fram-  ing the fundamental laws for the protection of  the ballot, and for the maintenance of an un-  sullied and efficient judiciary. Mr. Nicoll was  associated in that work with Senator and  former Secretary of State Elihu Root and  Hon. Joseph H. Choate, former ambassador  to Great Britain. The results of the labors of  that constitutional convention have, on the  whole, proved highly beneficial and satisfac-  tory to the people of New York state Thf  safeguards erected against excessive indebt-  edness have served to strengthen municipal  credit, and the secrecy and purity of the ballot     have been fostered and strengthened by the  provisions of the constitution bearing on the  suffrage.   Hon. De Lancey Nicoll was well known be-  fore, but his latest triumph in vindicating lib-  erty of the press and preventing the editor of  a great New York newspaper and his asso-  ciates from being seized and carried away  to the Baslile of Federal Administration and  there to be given a drumhead trial on the  charge of libelling the government, was a  crowning achievement that has meant inter-  national fame for Mr. Nicoll. His magnificent  protest against the proposed usurpation, his  plea in behalf of that freedom of speech and  of the press which the founders of the Nation  regarded as indispensable to the perpetuation  of the liberties for which they offered their  lives, rang like the shots at Lexington, from  one end of the Union to the other, and found  echo wherever civilized man aspires to the  enjoyment of life, liberty and the pursuit of  happiness.   Taste and elegance are apparent in Mr.  Nicoll's home surroundings, and his private  library indicates the judgment of a connois-  seur in regard to literature of the past and  present. Mr. Nicoll has always shown a  wholesome realization of the fact that physical  exercise is necessary to maintain the best con-  ditions of mind and body. In earlier years  he was noted as one of the most expert lawn  tennis players, and won many games at that  delightful pastime. With the introduction of  golf into general favor, Mr. Nicoll became a  confirmed golf player, and it has continued to  be one of his regular recreations. He is a  member of the Tu.xedo Club, and also belongs  to the Metropolitan, Manhattan, Union, Law,  University, Democratic, Racquet and other  clubs, and the Downtown Association.   Mr. Nicoll was married in i8go to Maud  Churchill, of the old .American family of that  name, which includes soldiers, statesmen, law-  yers, artists and one well known author in  its past and present lineage. They have two  children, De Lancey and Josephine.     Of the many colonial  DE PEYSTER families of .\mcrica. none   gained more distinction  than the De Peyster family of New York.  The name was originally written de Payster     4.';o     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     or de Paster, and de Peyster. Tliis last form  was the one adopted by most of the family.  The first authentic record made of tlie family  was in 1148, when Archambaud de Paster  witnessed the deed of a gift by William d'  Ypres to the church of St. Winnoc de Ber-  gues, in Flanders, now embraced in the De-  partment du Nord, France. In 1328 Hugues  Peyster, of Bambeke, was killed in the battle  of Cassel.   The family was especially prominent in  Ghent. The first record made of the family in  this city was in 1322, when Henry de Payster  was mentioned as residing on Pensterwech  street. He became wealthy and served for  several years as captain in the militia. He  was survived by tRree sons: i. Henry, mar-  ried Marguerite Ondermaercx, and died in  1353; three sons, of whom one, Henry, served  as schepen of Parchons. 2. Jean, became a  prominent citizen of Ghent; he married a  daughter of Sir Francis Van der Hamme.  3. George, married a Miss Van Merlebeke.   During the fourteenth century several of  the family became prominent in Ghent. That  the family was one of the most influential in  the city was shown by its members holding  the office of 'schepen,' only held by persons  of the highest rank. Piara (Pierre) de Pey-  ster served as captain of the archers, and took  part in an expedition to Alost in 1345. Bald-  win de Peyster, son of William de Peyster,  held in 1352 a 'feod'' of the abbey of St.  Pierre. In 1382, after the Flemings were de-  feated at Roosebeke. Jean de Peyster was one  of the five ambassadors sent ta Philip VI. of  France. Many of the family held high office  in the various guilds of the city. During  1558-59 Lievcn de Peyster served as royalty  of the .^rchers of St. George and in 1560 held  the office of emperor.   The family was among the first in Flanders  to embrace the Protestant faith. Its members  became prominent in that great religious move-  ment. Jacques de Peyster, of Bergues. son  of Francis de Peyster, was condemned for  being a Protestant and was banished and his  property confiscated. Cornelius de Peyster, of  Bergues, an active Protestant, was hanged in  April, 1568. Soon after the massacre of St.  Bartholomew, August 24. 1572. many of the  Huguenot families were expelled from France.  Among the unhappy exiles who found asylum     in Holland were members of the De Peyster  family.   Johannes de Peyster, the founder of the  family in America, was a direct descendant of  Jesse de Peyster, born in Ghent in 1490, the  line of descent being as follows:   (.Ij Jesse de Peyster had three sons: i.  Jesse, of whom further. 2. Jean, became the  city goldsmith of Ghent ; was a Huguenot and  forced to leave the country ; he died previous  to 1584; he married the widow of a Mr. \'an  Reysschoot. 3. Jacques, became prominent in  his native city; he was a goldsmith and a  Huguenot ; he fled from the country, but re-  turned to his native city about 1584; two chil-  dren ; Jacques and Antoine.   (IIj Jesse (2), son of Jesse (i) de Peyster,  was born in Ghent about 15 15. He was a  prominent citizen of his native city. He was  one of the first to join the Huguenot move-  ment and was obliged to leave the country.  After 1584 he returned to Ghent. He owned  property on Champ street. He married (first)  Elizabeth Danckaerts. One child, Elizabeth.  He married (second) Miss Bruggheman. One  child. Jesse, mentioned below.   (III) Jesse (3), son of Jesse (2) and   (Bruggheman) de Peyster, was born in Ghent  about 1550, died there in 1607. He followed  the trade of a goldsmith and acquired a large  property. For some years he served as lieu-  tenant of the burgher guard. Owing to his  religious views he was obliged to leave his  native land. He returned in 1584. He mar-  ried, about 1580, Jeanne Vande Voorde. Six  children: Jesse, died about 1630, married  Francoise Gay; Jean (Johannes), mentioned  below ; Jacques, married Catharine de la \'oye,  died 1646; Licven. married in 1627, Jeanne  Slichers, widow of Arnaud Bressels : Jonas,  married Jcane \'andcr Cruycen, and lived in  London, England ; Marie, married Jacques de  Kay, of Ghent.   (IV) Jean (Johannes), son of Jesse (3'*  de Peyster. was born in Ghent, in 1586, died  in Haarlem, Holland, in 1648. He was edu-  cated in the schools of his city and studied  law in Leyden. He inherited a large property  and was one of the most prominent citizens  of his city. Owing to his religious views he  was forced to leave the country, and seek an  asylum in Holland. He resided for a time in  Amsterdam and later in Haarlem. He mar-     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     451     ried Josine Martins. Four children : Jean  (Johannes), founder of the American family,  mentioned below ; Abraham, died in 1656, no  children; Jeane, married a Mr. Bruynsteen ;  Isaac, married Gertrude \'an Mierop, of Rot-  terdam.   ( I) The progenitor of the family in America  was Johannes (Jean) de Peyster, son of Jean  and Josine (Martins) de Peyster. He was  born in Haarlem, Holland, in 1628. He re-  ceived a liberal education. About 1645 h^  made a brief visit to New Amsterdam and  shortly returned for a permanent residence.  The exact date is not definitely known, but as  early as 1649 1^^ was a member of the Dutch  church. He possessed a large fortune, and  having a good education, he at once took a  prominent place in the civic, business and so-  cial life of the growing colony. He brought  with him from Holland many pieces of fur-  niture, valuable paintings and silverware, but  his most interesting possession was a family  carriage, said to be the first used in America.  He soon became a large holder of real estate  in New Amsterdam and was considered one of  the wealthiest citizens in the province. In  1653 he was assessed one hundred guilders,  only eleven persons paying more. In 1654 he  was the fourth person in the list of con-  tributors toward building the palisades for the  protection of the town, and in 1655 was one  of the most generous contributors to the fund  for general defence of the colony. At an  early date he became identified with the militia  of the colony, his first commission being an  'adelforst' or cadet in one of the companies.  He was prominent in the civil affairs of the  city and was one of Governor Stuyvesant's  most loyal supporters. In 1665 he was one  of six burghers to draft the first city charter  of New Amsterdam. In i6!;5 he was ap-  pointed 'schepen,' an office involving both the  duties of a magistrate and sheriff. This office  he held in 1657-58-62. During the first Eng-  lish regime, 1664-73. ^^ took an active part in  forcing Governor Nichols to give the Dutch  inhabitants more freedom. He again served  as schepen in 1665, and was alderman during  1666-69-73. ^^'hen New .Amsterdam was re-  taken by the Dutch commanders. Admirals  Evertsen and Beucke. July 30, 1673, Mr. de  Peyster was one of the prominent citizens con-  sulted by these officers as to the conduct of     the affairs of the province. In August, 1673,  the name of the city was changed to New  Orange, and he was one of the three apiwintcd  by the council of war to rule the town. He  was also a member of the committee of five  to provide for defence against the English,  • who were again threatening the province.  When England again gained possession of the  province in 1674. Mr. de Peyster cheerfully  accepted the rule of the new government and  used his influence with its citizens to ])roniote  harmony in the conduct of the affairs of the  city. In 1677 he was made deputy mayor of  the city, and on October 15 of the same year  was appointed mayor, which office he declined  on the ground of insufficient knowledge of  the English language. Mr. de Peyster was  possessed of marked literary ability, and was  an able orator. Governor Dongan stated that  he could 'make a better platform speech than  any other man outside of parliament.'

He had extensive acquaint-  ances throughout the colonies, and accounted  as his friends many of the noted men of the  time.

To  aid in the extending of the shipping facilities  of the city, he gave a large tract of land along  the river front.

The surname Sickles is Hol-   SICKLES land Dutch in origin, and was   already conspicuous in the   early developments of New Amsterdam and   Albany.   Zacharias Van Weenen Sickles, born at  Vienna. Austria, about 1630, went to Holland     and from there to Curacoa, where he served  as cadet, and when Stuyvesant returned from  a visit to Curacoa in 1655 Sickles came with  him and soon after became attached to the  garrison at Fort Orange, remaining in Albany  after the surrender of 1664, and remov-  ing to New York in 1693, where he was ad-  mitted freeman in 1698. He married, in 1658  or 1660, Anna, daughter of Lambert and  Anatie Van Valkenbergh, who were residing  at New Amsterdam in 1644, and afterwards  went to Albany. He would seem to be the  chief American progenitor of the Sickles. He  had a son Robert, who married Geertrny Rid-  derhaas, April 5, 1^86, their children, Maria,  Sophia, Henricus and Elizabeth, being bap-  tized at Albany and New York. He had an-  other son, Lambert, whose children were  Johannes and Alida. Another of his sons was  Thomas, who settled in New York and had  a large family. Zacharias, another son, bom  at Albany in 1670, died January 20, 1729, set-  tled in Harlem in 1693 and bought of his  father-in-law some land in Harlem in 1705,  at his death owning about forty-three acres.  This Zacharias married (first) August 23,  1693, Maria, daughter of Jan Hendriks and  Annatje (Bastiens) Brevoort, who were mar-  ried January 29, 1668; and (second) July 19.  1717, Wyntie Dyckman. Zacharias, son of  Lambert, and grandson of Zacharias, the first  settler, married Annati Wyngaard, July 4.  1728. She was buried August 6, 1746. One  of the children of Zacharias and .^nnati  (Wyngaard) Sickles, namely Abraham, born  June 5, 1737, married Maria Cannel, Connell,  Kanner or Connor, April 16, 1767. She died  May 28, 1829. Their son Zacharias married  Catherine Sheers, June iq, 1777.   Garret Sickles, who lived at Stuyvesant,  was born in 1732, died in 1830. He mar-  ried Hielchi Clow, and his son Garret Zach-  arias Sickles, who appears to have been a su-  pervisor for some years, living at Stuyve-  sant, married, in 1814, Elizabeth Sharp. Gar-  ret Zacharias Sickles was born in 1788. It  has been found impossible, with the available  records, to give the line that follows with ful-  ness that approaches complete accuracy, but  it is probable that the finding of one or two  further connecting links will show the line  to be part of some of the foregoing branches.   (I) George Garrett Sickles, the first ascer-     456     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     tainable ancestor of the branch of the Sickles  family here dealt with, was born in New York  City about the year 1799. He was engaged  in mercantile pursuits and acquired a compe-  tency. He married, about 1820, Susan, daugh-  ter of a Mr. Marsh, who was probably con-  nected with some of the colonial Marsh fam-  ilies of New England. These families appear  to have been English in origin, for men of  the Marsh name are said to have been known  in all parts of England ever since the intro-  duction of surnames. The name is also found  in Ireland, but it would appear to be ex-  tremely rare, it it exists at all, in Scotland.  Two hundred and fifty years ago there were  at least six men of the Marsh name who had  left the .shores of the British Isles for this  new world. The first of the six to come was  John Marshc. who took oath March 24, 1633,  and settled first in Salem and then in Hart-  ford. George, whose name became associated  with Hingham, came nearly as early, drawing  his home lot at Hingham, Massachusetts, on  September 18, 1635. Also in that year, 1635,  four others of the name came : for on March  13 another John Marsh, aged twenty-six, hav-  ing taken the oath of fidelity to the English  king and crown, set sail on the 'Plain John'  for Virginia, as all New England was then  called.   In the same year, a week or so later than  the coming of John Marsh, the second, on  May 21, upon the 'Matthew of London,'  William Marsh, aged twenty-six, sailed for St.  Christopher, and was possibly the William  Marsh who came to Plainfield, Connecticut,  in Cromwell's day, of whom an account says  that he was at Boston in 1636. And on July  27. 1635, John or Jonathan Marsh, aged  thirty-three, and Frances Marsh, aged twenty-  eight, came over on the 'Primrose,' Captain  Douglas, master. Thus in 1635 six of the  Marsh name, whether they belonged all or  some of them to the same family has not yet  been ascertained, had sailed on five different  vessels that year and on another two years  before. Samuel Marsh was at New Haven in  1647. Thomas Marsh came in i64<S; .Mex-  ander Marsh, of Braintree, is mentioned in  the records as arriving in 1654 and later set-  tling at Braintree. Another entry is to the  eflFect that John and Sarah Marsh had a son  born in Boston in i66g. Others of the name.     in various parts of New England, followed.   (II) General Daniel Edgar Sickles, son of  George Garrett and Susan (Marsh) Sickles,  was born in New York City, October 20, 1825.  He was educated in the University of the City  of New York, but left before the entire  course was completed to learn the printer's  trade, a trade which he followed for several  years. He then studied law and was admitted  to the bar in 1844 and began practicing in New  York City. In 1847 he was elected to the  legislature, in which body he took rank as  a leader of the Democrats. In 1853 he was  appointed corporation counsel of New York  City, and on July 30 of the same year he  was commissioned as secretary of the lega-  tion at London and accompanied James Bu-  chanan to England. He returned in the year  1855, and was elected, after an energetic can-  vass, to the state senate in the autumn, and  a year later he was chosen a member of con-  gress, taking his seat December 7, 1857. Dis-  covering a guilty intimacy between his wife  and Philip Barton Key, United States attor-  ney for the District of Columbia, he shot the  latter in the street, February 27, 1859. He  was indicted and after a trial of twenty days,  acquitted. He had been elected for a second  term in 1838, and served until March 3, 1861.  At the beginning of the civil w-ar he raised  the Excelsior Brigade of United States Vol-  unteers in New York City and was commis-  sioned by the president as colonel of one of  the five regiments. On September 3. 1861,  the president nominated him brigadier-general  of volunteers. The senate rejected his name  in March, 1862, but confirmed it on a second  nomination. He commanded a brigade under  General Joseph Hooker and gained distinction  at Williamsburg, Fair Oaks and Malvern Hill.  His brigade saw service in the seven days'  fight before Richmond and in the Margrand  campaign, and bore a conspicuous part at .\n-  tietam.   He succeeded General Hooker in the com-  mand of the division and was engaged at  Frdericksburg. On the organization of the  Army of the Potomac he was assigned to the  command of the Third Army Corps, and was  appointed major-general on March 7, 1863,  his commission dating from November 2Q,  1862. At Chanccllorsville he displayed gal-  lantry and energy, gaining the first success     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     457     of the day by cutting off the ammunition train  of the enemy, arresting a general panic by  rallying the retreating artillery, and with-  standing the force of Stonewall Jackson's  attack with determination after the line was  formed.   At Gettysburg his corps was posted be-  tween Cemetery Hill and Little Round Top  He advanced to an elevation, which he  thought desirable to hold, and in this position  was assailed by General James Longstrect's  column, while General John B. Hood en-  deavored to gain the unoccupied slope of the  Little Round Top. In the desperate struggle  that followed the Third Corps effectively aid-  ed in preserving that important position from  the enemy, but was shattered by the onset of  the overwhelming numbers of the enemy.  After the line was broken General Ambrose  P. Hill followed the Confederate advantage  up with an attack on Sickles' right, during  which General Sickles lost a leg. He con-  tinued in active service until the beginning  of the year 1865 and was then sent on a con-  fidential mission to Columbia and some other  South American countries. On July 2R, 1866.  he joined the regular army as colonel of the  Forty-second Infantry. On March 2, 1867,  he was brevetted brigadier-general for brav-  ery at Fredericksburg, and major-general for  gallantry and meritorious service at Gettys-  burg. He commanded the military district of  the Carolinas in 1865. continuing to 1867, and  carried out the work of reconstruction so  energetically that President Johnson relieved  him of his command, after offering him the  mission to the Netherlands, a post which he  declined.   He was mustered out of ■ the vohmtcer  service January t. 1868, and on April T4,  i860, w'as placed on the retired list of the  Lfnitcd States army with the full rank of  major-general. He was active in promoting  the candidacy of General Ulysses S. Grant  for the presidency, and on May 15. i860, he  was appointed minister to Spain. Relinquish-  ing this post Alarch 20. 1873, he resumed his  residence in New York City. He is president  of the New York state board of the civil ser-  vice commission, and he is likewise on the  board of commissioners for the erection of  New York monuments at Gettysburg. He be-  longs to a great number of clubs and patriotic     societies, and still takes a prominent part in  the movements arising out of the public ques-  tions of the day.     The origin of the  SCHERMERHORN family name of  Schermer horn is  said to have been derived from the Dutch  words 'schermer,' meaning a fencer, and  'hoorn,' the word for horn, which is em-  blematic of power or plenty : but considering  the fact that it is a Dutch family, originally  residents of Holland, where a large propor-  tion of the families took name from a locality  when emigrating, it is reasonable to believe  that they dwelt near the town of Hoorn. in the  province of North Holland, situated some  twenty miles northeast of Amsterdam and  located on the Hoornerhop, a bay of the Zuy-  der Zee. There is also a town of the name,  Schermerhorn, in that neighborhood. The  prominent member giving name to the family  in the early days might have been commonly  known as 'the fencer of Hoorn,' hence the  use of the Dutch designative. Schermerhorn.  The name has been spelled in a variety of  ways, as reference to the ancient records of  this country, written in Dutch, will show.  Sometimes it is found in the form Schermer-  hoorn, Schermerhorne. as well as Schermer-  hooven and Scher-Hooren.   (I) Jacob Janse Schermerh'^rn was tiie  progenitor of this family in .\merica He  was the son of Jan (or John) .'^chernlerhnrn,  and was born at Watcrland. Holland, in the  year 1622. It is said that he came to this  country on the ship 'Arms of Rensselaers-  wyck,'' sailing on October i, 1636, and arriv-  ing that same year at Beverwyck (.Mhany),  New York. How he happened to make the  voyage when only fourteen years of age. if  the date of his birth be correct, cannot be  said; but it is as likely that he came in 1643.  under the au=oices of Patroon Kiliaen Van  Rensselaer, who was then exerting himself to  upbuild his colony of Rensselacrswyck. and as  both the fatb'^r of youn?: .'^che^luerllorn and  the Patroon lived in .\msterflam, it is most  probable that the former knew about the plan  of colonization and saw an advantage in ac-  cepting the proposition to grow up with the  new country. However, his name appears as  the twelfth male member of the Protestant     45«     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Reformed Dutch Church in Beverwyck, which  was organized in 1642, by Dominie Johannes  Megapolensis, and built the following year  near the bank of the Hudson river, at Albany.   He prospered both as a trader with the  Indians and as a brewer. In 1648, he broke  the law regarding the sale of firearms and  aniinuiiition to the savages, and after lieing  tried by order of Governor Peter Stuyvesant,  was sentenced to banishment for a term of  five years, and it was also ordered that his  property l)e confiscated. A number of the  prominent citizens sided with him in consid-  ering the penalty too severe, and succeeded in  having the banishment clause set aside ; but  his property was seized. He thereupon made  complaint to the states general because of the  severity of penalties for minor offenses. He  received grants of land at Beverwyck on No-  vember 9, 1652, and October 25, 1653. It is  recorded that he executed others on July 13,  1651. His estate was so large that it was ex-  ceeded by but a few excepting the patroon's  and those of men of official rank in the col-  ony. He was made one of the commissaries  (magistrate) of the jurisdiction of Beverwyck,  and in 1654 visited his father, then residing in  Amsterdam, Holland. Upon his return to  this country he was again nominated, April  S, 1656, to the same office, and continued to  fill the position until 1675, '^ 'o*^ longer. As  a member of the consistory of the Dutch  church of Albany, he audited the deacons' ac-  counts, in 1665. The following year he kept  the accounts himself, and again audited them  in 1671, ir)72, 1685 and in 1686. In the sum-  mer of 1688, he made another brief visit to  Holland. Shortly after the first settlers ar-  rived at .Schenectady, he removed there, where  he died in 1688. having made his will on May  20, 1688, which is recorded in the office of the  Albany county clerk. At the time of his  demise his estate was valued at 56,882  guilders ($23,000), and besides his property  in Albany and .Schenectady, he owned land at  Schodack, New York, and also had funds  drawing interest in Holland.

(II) Symon Jacobse, son of Jacob Janse  and Jannetje (Segers) Schermerhorn, was  born at Beverwyck (Albany), in 1658. He  removed to Schenectady, New York, before  1690, possibly when his father bought proper-  ty and went there to reside triwards the end  of his life, for his father died there in 1688.  Symon became a hero of the Mohawk valley  at the time of the great Indian massacre of  Schenectady, when on the bitterly cold night  of February 8, 1690, they and the French  from Canada swept down u])on the little vil-  lage and not only burnefl the place but  slaughtered practically every inhabitant, spar-  ing only an isolated family or two with whom  they had been friendly for reason. It was  then that Symon Schermerhorn. like Paul  Revere, started out for a midnight ride to  warn the inhabitants of .Mbany that the enemy  was but seventeen miles distant and was burn-  ing everything in the path. He made the ride  in peril, for his horse was wounded, and he  was shot through the thigh ; but he presevered,  and arrived at .Mbany in time to liave the  Dutch burghers rally to the rescue of the  \'illagc on the Mohawk. Captain Bull's com-  pany immediately went over the plains, but  when they came upon the scene of devastation  a!id brutality, the frame houses were smould-  ering ruins and the blood of the victims had  frozen the slain to the earth. In the list of  killed during the massacre appear the names  of his son. Johannes, of his three negroes, of  Arnout, the son of Arnout Cornelise \'iele,  the interpreter, and of Mary \'iele, the last  two being probablv the brother and sister of  Symon Schermerhorn's wife He removed to     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     459     New York City in 1691, possibly discouraged  and too much afraid of living in a locality  subject to Indian marauders, and became the  commander and owner of a craft navigating  the Hudson. He died in New York City, in  1696, leaving a widow and one son, Arnout,  and possibly two daughters.   Symon Jacobse Schermerhorn married, in  1683, Willempje, daughter of Arnout and  Gerritje (Ferritse) Viele, of Amsterdam,  Holland.

(Ill) Arnout, son of Symon Jacobse and  Willempje (Viele) Schermerhorn, was born  either in Schenectady or Albany, but was bap-  tized at the latter place on November 7, 1686.  His parents were probably residents of Schen-  ectady at that time and how any member of his  family escaped being massacred is not known ;  but his parents took him and his sister to live  in New York City in 169;, the year following  the Indian massacre. He is described in all  records as a mariner. He made his way, for  his name appears a great many times at the  register's office in connection with conveyances.  On April 21, 1726, April 3, 1729, and on Feb-  ruary 10, 1730, he obtained, by purchase from  his father-in-law, Johannes Beekman, of New  York City, three parcels of land, known as  water-lots, on the south side of Queen (now  Pearl street), between Fulton and Beekman  streets, as since opened or extended. Upon a  portion of this land, be built a wharf, which  appears as Schermerhorn's wharf on the  James Lyne Map of New York, in 1728. Ad-  joining it on the east appears Cannon's wharf  Upon the higher land nearby, Johannes Beek-  man, Arnout Schermerhorn and John Cannon  had their residences and places of business,  and their wharves or gardens extended over  the site of Fulton market. These three fam-  ilies, living close together, had descendants     who intermarried. He died some time after  1742.   Arnout Schermerhorn married, about 17 10,  in New York City, Maritje (Mary or Marial.  daughter of Johannes Beekman, of that place.  Children: i.

(IV) John, son of Arnout and Maritje  (Beekman) Schermerhorn, was born in New  York City, July 8, 171 5, and baptized there,  July 13, 1715. He died in that place on Sep-  tember 10, 1768. Like his father and grand-  father had been, he was a sea-faring man.  He was known as a 'master,' and probably  was the owner of trading vessels plying be-  tween New York and Charleston, South Car-  olina. Records also place him as 'merchant.'  He was also engaged in fitting out 'Letters  of Marque,' or 'Privateers,' in the war be-  tween England and France. From a general  release, dated December 10, 1761, recorded in  the register's office, in liber 36 of con., p. 49.  it would appear that he paid bff certain liabili-  ties of his father.   John Schermerhorn married, in New York  City, June 10, 1741, Sarah, daughter of John  Cannon, who was descended from a family  of refugees from Rochelle, France, which  came to this country n -t long after the revoca-  tion of the Edict of Nantes.

(V) Peter, son of John and .Sarah (Can-  non) Schermerhorn, was born in New York  City, October i, 1749. and was baptized there  on October 11. He died at his residence, No  68 Broadway, January 28, 1826. He adopted  the calling of his father and grandfather at  an early age, for in his marriage certificate,  which is dated in his twenty-second year, he  is styled 'Captain' Schermerhorn. He like-  wise owned trading vessels running between  New York and Charleston. During the  troubles in New York, in 1776, after the  'Asia' fired upon the town and before the  British took possession, he removed with his  family to the neighborhood of Hyde Park,  on the Hudson river, and there remained un-  til after the peace of 1783; some of his chil-  dren having been born there. The motives  for this removal were mostly political, but it  was probable that so much of his propertv as  consisted of vessels was, by the same means,  saved from seizure. Many, if not all, of the     members of his father's family withdraw from.  New York at the same time. After his re-  turn to New York he established himself in  business as a ship chandler, admitting in 1802  his second son, Peter, and in 1808 his third  son, Abraham, the styles of the firm having  been successively Peter Schermerhorn & Son  and Peter Schermerhorn & Sons. In 1791  his place of business and his residence w'ere at  Nos. 71 and y;^ Water street, respectively, in  1794, at Nos. 220 and 224 Water street, re-  spectively, while, in 1799, they were trans-  ferred, the former to 243 Water street and the  latter to No. 68 Broadway, and there remain-  ed until his death. In 1795 he with his brother  Simon purchased, probably from the execu-  tors of Jacob Bennet, about 160 acres at Go-  wanus (Brooklyn), which they made their  summer residence. In 1816, having acquired  his brother's interest, he conveyed the whole  to his son, Abraham. A part of it is now com-  prised in Greenwood cemetery. On January  28, 1806, he purchased from Thomas Marsten,  about four and a half acres on the East river,  at the foot of Eighty-second street, which he  occupied in summer, until his death. On Jan-  uary 31, 1S09. with Mattlicw Clarkson, Her-  man Leroy, Henry Rogers and Gulian Lud-  low, he conveyed to the 'Rector, etc., of Grace  Church.' property on the corner of Rector  street and Broadway, upon which the old Ger-  man Lutheran church stood formerly, and  upon which Grace church had then just been  erected, such property having been conveyed  to the grantors by the trustees of said Lutheran  church, in trust, to convey the same to Grace  Church so soon as it should have been in-  corporated. In 1796, he was elected a director  of the Bank of New York, which was organ-  ized in 1784.   Peter .Schermerhorn married, in New York  City. September 11, 1771.

(VI) John, son of Peter and Elizabeth  (Bussing) Schermerhorn, was born in New  York City, June 13, and was baptized there,  June 25, 1775, sponsors, Simon Schermerhorn,  and Mary Brewerton, wife of John Brewerton,  of South Carolina. He died in 1831.   John Schermerhorn married, at New York  City, May 27, 1802, Rebecca H. Stevens,  daughter of General Ebenezer Stevens, who  was born in 1780, and died in 181 5. General  Stevens was one of the famous 'Boston Tea  Party,' commanded artillery at Saratoga and  Yorktown, and also served throughout the  War of 1812. Children : i.

(VI) Peter, son of Peter and Elizabeth  (Bussing) Schermerhorn, was born at Stou-  tenburgh's, now Hyde Park, Duchess county.  New York. April 22, 1781. and was baptized  September 29, 1782, at Poughkeepsie, New  York. He died in the Hardenbrook House,  New York City, Jvme 23, 1852. He was as-  sociated with his father in business in 1802,  under the style of Peter Schermerhorn & Son,  ship chandlers. His brother, Abraham, was  admitted to the firm in 1808, the style becom-  ing Peter Schermerhorn & Sons. In 1810 the  two brothers formed a separate firm, styled  Schermerhorn & Company, carrying on the  same line of business at the corner of Wash-  ington and Rector streets, retaining, however,  their connection witli the older firm. After  the death of their father, two firms were  formed, viz.. Schermerhorn, Banker & Com-  pany, at No. 243 Water street, and Schermer-  horn. Willis & Company, at No. 53 South  street. After his marriage in 1804 he resided  at No 88 Greenwich street, and at No. 152  Greenwich street, southwest corner of Cort-  landt, in 1808. In 181 5 he purchased No. 21  Park place, then Robinson street, extending  through to Murray street, which he continued     to occupy until 1843, when he removed to a  new house, built for himself, on the north-  west corner of Great Jones street and Lafay-  ette place, where he resided until his death.  Soon after his marriage, he erected a summer  residence on the bank of the East river, at  the foot of East Sixty-seventli street, upon a  portion of the Louvre farm, tiie country seat  of his father-in-law, John Jones. It consisted  of 132 acres, extending from Third avenue  to the East river, and from Sixty-sixth street  to Seventy-fifth street. After the death of  John Jones, the farm was partitioned among  his children, division No. i falling to the lot  of his daughter, Sarah, wife of Peter Scher-  merhorn. This was the division nearest the  city, and included the summer residence above  mentioned. Adjoining it, on the south, lay  Hardenbrook Farm, of about twenty acres,  between Sixty-fourth and Sixty-sixth streets.  Third avenue and the East river. This Peter  Schermerhorn purchased in 1818, from the  heirs of John Hardenbrook, and adding it to  his wife's share of the Louvre Farm, gave  to the whole the name of Belmont Farm. He  at once removed to the Hardenbrook House,  at the foot of East Sixty-fourth street, in  which he died. He was elected to the vestry  of Grace Church in 1820, and was one of the  wardens in 1845, retaining the position until  his death. He was one of the building com-  mittee imder whose superintenrVence the new  church and rectory on Broadway, near Tenth  street, were erected, and completed in 1846,  taking an active part in all the arrangements  whereby the transfer of the church, from the  original site on Broadway at Rector street.  was effected. He was elected a director of  the Bank of New York in 1814, and so con-  tinued until he died.   Peter Schermerhorn married, in New York  City. April 5. 1804.

Brokaw is the anglicized form  BROKAW' of the ancient and honorable  name of Broucard, at one time  among the most noted in France, and which  today is well known in that country. Its  original bearer in America was a Huguenot,  or French Protestant, who appears to have  lived first in France, and later in Mannheim,  whence he went to America. Baird, in his  'Huguenot Emigration to America,' says:  'Mannheim itself now became the home of  many French refugees, and among them we  recognize several French families that after-  wards moved to America. Here David de  Marest, Frederick de Vaux, Abraham Has-  broucq, Cretien Duyou, Mathese Blanchan,  Meynard Journeay, Thonnet Terrin. Pierre  Parmentier, Antoine Crispel, David Usilie,  Phillipe Casier, Bourgeon Brouqard. .^imon  Le Febre, Juste Durie. and others, enjovcd  for several years the kindness of their Ger-  man coreligionists and the protection of the  good Elector Palatine.' This Boursreon Bron-  Card was the direct ancestor of the Brokaw  family in America, the name having gradually  been metamorphosed to the form now gener-  ally in use in New York and elsewhere.   fl) Bourgeon Broucard. the immigrant an-  cestor of the Broucard or Brokaw family, was  born in 1645;, or thereabouts,- probablv in or  near La Rochelle. France, and died after the  year 1702, at Bushwick, Long Island He was  of an old and honorable French family of that  name, and it is recorded that even the Catholic  bishops acknowledge that the Protestants were  a loval. faithful, hard-workine. sober and  well-to-do class of French subiects, their only  fault being that they preferred persecution,  death, the confiscation of their property and  exile from the land thev loved, to eivine un  of their religious convictions. He came with     other Huguenots from Mannheim, Germany,  to the English colonies in 1675, and landed in  New York. He resided in Bushwick, Long  Island, where he purchased land in 1684. This  he sold in 1688, and moved to Newtown, Long  Island, where he was one of the prominent  men in the settlement, and where he assisted  in all church services at the humble little  church that had been erected at that place.  He married previous to 1675 (the exact date  unobtainable), Catherine Le Febre, daughter  or sister of Simon Le Febre, who was living  at Mannheim at the time that Bourgeon Brou-  card made his home in that hospitable city.  -She accompanied him to America, and the  proof that he was a man of substance is that  he paid the passage of himself and family and  had enough left to buy a comfortable home  immediately after landing. Children : Maria ;  Jane ; Catalina ; Isaac ; John ; Jacob ; Peter ;  Abraham, of whom further.   (II) Abraham, son of Bourgeon and Cath-  erine (Le Febre) Broucard, was born in 1684,  at Bushwick, Long Island, and died in 1747;  the exact day of his death is not known, but  a fairly correct idea may be gathered from  the record of his will, which was dated May  25, 1747, proved September 9, in the same  vear, and on October 12. 1747, the record at  Trenton, New Jersey, being October 16, 1747-  Abraham resided in Somerset county. New  Jersey, and was a miller by occupation. He  was a noted Indian fighter, and his name  appears among those who were detailed to  keep strict watch on the red men who ever  hovered in the vicinity. He was public-  spirited, and his name (spelled Abra. Broch-  ard) is on the roster of the local militia. He  served in Captain Peter Demonl's (sixth)  company. Colonel Thomas flfarmar's rof'iment  of New Jersey militia, 1715. His wife, Maritie  (Margaret or Mary), was mentioned in his  will. Like her husband she was a Spartan,  and bore the hardships of those early days  with a good will. Children: Catalyntje: Isaac,  of whom further: Brugon (or Bourgeon);  Abraham, George, Christopher, John. Mary,  Jane, Engeltje.   (III) Isaac, -son of Abraham and Maritie  Broucard. or Brokaw. was born in 1710. bap-  tized April s. 1719. in R-irit-Ti- now Somer-  ville. New Jersey, and died probably in 1708.  His will was dated September 23, I793- proved     464     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     February 20, 1799, at Hillsborough, Somer-  set county, New Jersey. Like his father, he  was detailed to watch the Indians, and, having  a wife and eight children to add an incentive  to his task, he was ever on the alert for the  dark skinned foe. The name of an Isaac  Brougard appears on the list of a company  under Sir Jeffrey Amherst when he was  skirmishing with the French. Isaac was a  private soldier in the war of the revolution,  and, though advanced in age, he gave a good  account of himself. He resided most of his  adult life at Hillsborough, where he acquired  property, and was considered a man of stand-  ing in the community. He married (first)   Maritje , who died before 1793; (second)   Styntje, who died after 1793, and was men-  tioned in her husband's will. Children : Abra-  ham; Maregritje : Marya; Laerte ; Eysack or  Isaac, of whom further; Caleb, David, Cath-  erine.   (IV) Isaac (2), son of Isaac (i) and  Maritje Brokaw. was born in Raritan (now  Somerville), New Jersey, baptized there July  8. 1759. and died July 29, 1838. He was a  valiant soldier in the war of the revolution,  fighting at the side of his father and brothers.  At the call to arms in 1812 he again shoul-  dered his musket in defense of his country.  He married Maria Van Nortwich, born March  24, 1759, died March 6. 1828. both of them  residing at Hillsborough and Greenbrook,  New Jersey. .She was descended from Simon  Van Nortwich. who came as a boy to America  in 1694 with his mother, stepfather, a brother  and sister. His mother, Cornelia Van Wess-   len, married (first) Van Nortwich;   (second) Dominie Wilhelmus Lupardus (with  whom he crossed the Atlantic), and (third)  Martin Schenck. Among the children of  Isaac (2) and Maria Brokaw was Simeon,  named for his ancestor, of whom further.   (V) Simeon, son of Isaac (2) and Maria  (Van Nortwich) Brokaw, was born Novem-  ber 22, 1792, at Greenbrook. New Jersey;  died February 3. 1854, at Metuchen. New  Jersey. He was for many years a prominent  citizen of both Greenbrook and Metuchen,  and was a progressive, up-to-date man. He  married, February 6. 1822, at Metuchen.  Prudence Vail, born February 17, 1795. at  Greenbrook, died May 14. 1887, at Plainfield.  New Jersey, daughter of \\'illiam and Jemima     (Cole) Vail (see Vail). She descended from  a long line of English ancestry ; the first im-  migrant of the family came over in 1660, or  thereabouts. For generations before the revo-  lutionary war the Vails were a prominent  family in New Jersey and New England.

History records that four distinct families  of the name of Tutle or Tuttle, or at least with  some name resembling these forms, came over  to America as early as 1634, three of them in  the ship 'Planter.' and the other in the  'Angel Gabriel.' which was wrecked off the  coast of Maine the same year. Totyl, Totehill,  Tothill and Tuttle are held to be synonymous.  The name is supposed to have originated by  families living near t'le natural or artificial  mounds called tot-hi'l^. which abound in  widely separated localities in England, and  was taken as a surname. A common origin,  or even blood relationship between all who  bear this name in any of its forms, is there-  fore unlikely. That they were important is  attested bv the use of coats-of-arms of at  least two branches. That of the Tothills of  Devonshire (from which the Tuttle family of  American sprang) , is thus described : 'Azure,  on a bend argent, cotized or a lion passant  sable. Crest — On a hill, vert, a dove proper  bearing an olive branch vert, with fruit or.'   The three Tuttles arriving on the 'Planter'  were John of Ipswich, Richard of Boston, and  William, who went to New Haven. The sur-  vivor of the 'Angel Gabriel' was John Tuttle,  of Dover, New Hampshire. A family pedi-  gree bearing the date of 1591 places at the  head of it one William Totyl, of Devonshire,  called 'esquire,' who served as bailiff in 1528  and again in 1548: he was high sheriff in 1549,  and lord mayor of Exeter in 1552. It is prob-  able that the immigrant Tuttles may have had  a close connection with this family. Another  authority derives the name, at least in Scot-  land and Ireland, from O'Tuathail, anglicized     Toole, Tuthill and Tuttle, the members of  which family were kings of Leinster, princes  of Imaile, and chiefs of Hy-Mureadaigh or  Hy-Murray, the surname being derived from  the commander Tuathail, who is number one  hundred and nine on the family pedigree. The  chief ancestor was Cahir the Great, who was  succeeded by Conn of the Hundred flatties in  the second century A. D. Lower derives the  names Turtle and Tuttle from an old tribe  name, Hy-Tuirtre, whose ancient territory  was the modern county Antrim.   (I) \\'illiam Tuttle. the immigrant ancestor  of the Tuttle family, was born about 1609,  and died in the early days of June, 1673. at  New Haven, Connecticut. He crossed from  England in the ship 'Planter,' which lanaea  in April, 1635, after a long and stormy voy-  age. He must have been a man of great  courage, for he, in common with other Eng-  lishmen, must have heard of the horrors of  the first winter at Plymouth and the subse-  quent Indian massacres, and the untold hard-  ships that befell the lot of the immigrants.  He was a man of substance, as he had the  wherewithal to pay the passage of himself and  family and to purchase a home for himself,  his wife, Elizabeth, aged twenty-three, and  children — John, aged three and a half years;  .'\nn, aged two and a half years ; and Thomas,  aged three months. Immediately after land-  ing- he began business for himself, and was  rated as a husbandman and merchant, he pur-  chasing land for a farm and establishinfr a  store. His wife, Elizabeth, was admitted to  the church in Boston. July 14, 16^6, and was  dismissed to the Ipswich church September 8,  t6^0. In 1635 he was eiven permission to  build a windmill at Charlcstown, and he be-  came a proprietor of Bo.ston in 163^1, owning  later, in 1641, a home lot in New Haven,  Connecticut, which he bought of Edward Hop-  kins. In i6i;o he boutrht of Joshua Atwater  his mansion house and barn and certain other  lands, afterwards the property of Mrs. Hester  Coster, who bequeathed them to the church.  The church sold it in 1717 to Yale College,  and it is now a part of the college grounds,  formerly enclosed by the historic 'fence.'  Mr. Tuttle was one of the first owners of  New Haven, and surveyed the road from the  ferry at Red Rock to Stony River. In 1659  he bought land at North Haven, and in 1661     466     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     a dwelling house and home lot of John Pun-  derson, which he gave to his son, John Tuttle.  He was assigned one of the best seats in the  meeting house, which shows his high standing  in the community. He was one of the peti-  tioners for permission to continue their settle-  ment in Delaware unmolested. This project  failed, however, and he remained in New  Haven where he farmed. He served as fence  viewer: in 1646 did garrison duty, being also  often on committees to settle boundary ques-  tions ; was many times on the jury; 1667 he  was constable. At his request, at a court held  in New Haven, May i, 1660, his daughter,  Sarah Tuttle, and Jacobeth Melyn, son of  Cornelius Melyn, the patroon of Staten Island,  of which he was sole proprietor by grant from  the home government, were prosecuted for  'sitting down on a chest together, his arm  about her waist and her arm upon his shoulder  or neck, and continuing in this sinful position  about a half an hour, in which time he kissed  her and she kissed him and they kissed one  another, as the witnesses testify.' They were  fined twenty shillings each, and one-half of  Sarah's was subsequently remitted at request  of her father. An inventory of William Tut-  tle's estate, Jime, 1673, by John Harriman and  William Bradley, places its value at £400 85s  6d. every article beine tabulated and valued.  His wife Elizabeth's estate, in Ecbniary, 1684.  was apnroved by M. Mansfield and John Al-  leng, Jr.; the tabulated list was £204 75s  3J^d.

He was a member  of the night watch, and was ever on the alert     for Indians. He was appointed constable, but  declined to serve. He married. May 2, 1667,  at New Haven, Hannah, daughter of Captain  Thomas Munson, baptized in New Haven in  1648, and died November 30, 1695, at Guil-  ford, Connecticut. Captain Munson was in  the Pequot war as sergeant under Mason,  1642; ensign in 1661-64; lieutenant in 1664-  76, under Captain Treat, in King Philip's  war; captain, 1676, of New Haven county  militia.

He married, .September 12, 160S. at Wond-  bridee, Ruth (Higgins) Fitz-Randolph  (widow of Fitz-Randolph). The Hiegins and  Fitz-Randolph families were considered the  gentry in that section nf New Jersey, and she  was accounted a beautiful woman anri a great  matrimonial catch by the chroniclers of that  day.

He was a member of the  Hanover Presbyterian church ; and was one of  the organizers of a company to resist the  British invasion. Although past fifty, he en-  listed, and was in many battles. An incident  is given that shows of what stuff Tuttles are  made: William, the youngest of five sons,  notified his father that he had enlisted. Cap-  tain Daniel stejjped to the door and said in  a peremptory tone : 'Here, Tim, Bill has  'listed and I want you to 'list also to take care  of him.' Timothy enlisted, as did the father  and the brothers Joseph, John, Daniel and  William. They were at Middle Brook, Valley  Forge and Morristown. There were twenty-  seven of the name of Tuttle in the revolu-  tionary war.

(The Vail Line).   There is a good deal of doubt as to the  origin of the surname. Vail or Vaill. but it  is generally claimed to be Welsh or English.  The Vails of Mayfield. Fulton county. New  York, are said to be descended from Samuel  Vail, who settled in the Mohawk Valley. He  had a brother William who settled in the town  of Galway, now Saratoga county. New York  Samuel Vail was for a long tine at Albany,  New York, where he was engaged as a carriage  btiilder. The immigrant ancestor of the Vails  of Troy is said to be John Vail, who settled in  Rye, in 1683, went toSouthhold, Long Island,  about 1700, and died there previous to 1770, at  the age of ninety-four years. The family, ac-  cording to one authority, originally Vaill. went  into France in 1 513. beginning with John  Vaill. born in Gloucestershire England, who     went into France with Henry \TII. as en-  sign. Another immigrant ancestor of the  name is Jeremiah \'ail or Vaill, who was a  resident of Salem, Massachusetts, as early as  1639, and July that year was a witness in  the court held there. In 1647 Jeremiah Vail  became a proprietor, bought land in 1648,  sold it in 165 1, and removed out of the juris-  diction. He was a blacksmith by trade, and  probably followed that trade during his resi-  dence in Salem. In 1645, his wife Cath-  arine was admitted to the church there. In  165 1 he removed to Gardiner's Island, then  called the Isle of Wight, and took charge,  with Anthony Waters, of the farm of Lieu-  tenant Lion r;ardiner of Long Island. Pre-  vious to his removal he had been granted, in  165 1, by the town of Southampton. Long  Island, a lot of land, provided that he set-  tle there before the following January and  do all the blacksmith work of the town. This  offer, however, he did not accept. In legal  and ecclesiastical affairs, Gardiner's Island  was subject to the authority of the town of  Easthampton, and its early records contain  several brief statements respecting Jeremiah  Vail. It is quite possible that there was a  relationship between Jeremiah Vail and  Thomas \'ail. another immigrant ancestor of  the \'ail family, mentioned below, but what  that relationship was. supposing it to have ex-  isted, has not been ascertained.   (I) Thomas Vail, immigrant ancestor of  the Vail family, resided before 1657 in South-  ampton, Long Island, and in Westchester  county. New York. He married (first) Sarah   . and (secoiuH Elizabeth . born 1(157,   and died November 3, 1747, at Woodbridge,  New Jersey ; the family names of neither of  Thomas' wives are on record. Elizabeth, his  second wife, survived him, and married (sec-  ond) a man of the name of Gach, and (third)  John Griffith.

(III) John, son of Samuel and Abigail  Vail, was born May 21, 1708, at Westchester,  New York, and died August 17, 1754, at  Plainfield, New Jersey. He was called John  Vail, ]r., to distinguish him from his uncle,  the Quaker preacher. He himself also be-  longed to the Society of Friends. He mar-  ried (first) in 1731, between November 19  and December 16 that year, Margaret, daugh-  ter of John and Elizabeth (Shotwell) Laing,  born November 9, 1710, at Old Plainfield, Pis-  cataway township, Middlesex county, New  Jersey, and died before 1751 ; (second) be-  fore November 17, 1751, Mary Laing, his  first wife's sister, born 1717.

(The Gould Line).   Gould or Gold is said by Lower to have  been a personal or baptismal name, where it  was known in England or had an English  origin, for the name occurs in Germany and  other countries. Golde and Goldus occur in  the Domesday Book, and Gold, in the Hun-  dred Rolls, had become a surname. As a  baptismal name it was in use in the four-  teenth century in some form that was pos-  sibly a variation of this name. As a man's  name. Gold must have been somewhat com-  mon in England, as many local names, since  become surnames, are compounded with it.  Examples of such names are Goldney, Gold-  ham, Goldey, Goldsbury, Goldsby, Golds-  worthy and Goldsthorpe. It also appears to  have given rise to the names of Golden and  Goulden, Golding and Goulding. The latter  are probably patronymical. The Golds are  said to be traceable, in one form of the name  or another, in the municipal records of Ex-  eter, to the time of Edward III.   (I) John Gould, immigrant ancestor of  the Go'uld family, is supposed to have been  born at Dartmouth. Devonshire. England, and  died at Elizabethtown, New Jersey.

He married Eloisa Elvira Tut-  tie. Children : Charles Judson, George Tuttle ;  Elvira Tuttle. mentioned below ; Josephine.   (VII) Elvira Tuttle. daughter of Joseph P.  Gould, was born March i, 1840, at Newark.  New Jersey; married. November 14, i860  Isaac V. Brokaw, born November 27, 1835,  at Metuchen. New Jersey, (see Brokaw).     This surname is also found almost  GRAY as frequently with the spelling,   'Grey.' Some genealogists derive  the name and the family in some cases from  Fulbert. chamberlain to Robert. Duke of Nor-  mandy, who held by his gift the castle of Croy,     in Picardy, from whence the name is assumed  to have been borrowed. There is, however,  no evidence for this pedigree, which is only  traced in some cases to Henry de Grey, to  whom Richard Coeur de Lion gave the manor  of Thurrock, county Essex, England, which  manor was subsequently known as Grey's  Thurrock. From the 'Recherches sur le Dom-  esday' of D'Anisy, it appears probable that  the family came from Grai or Gray, a village  near Caen, in Normandy. However this may  be, the first settler of the name in England  appears to have been Anchitillus Grai, a  Domesday tenant in Oxfordshire. There are  numerous Grays and Greys in Ireland and  Scotland too, but the greater number have a  (laelic or Milesian origin, the name being an  English rendering of a more ancient Gaelic  form. Thus the family name of Gilrea or  MacGilrea, anglicised in modern times into  Kilroy, and borne by the Milesian lords of  Clonderlaw in the territory now called Clare,  themselves a branch of the great 'Guinness'  family, has in many cases been translated to  Gray. The surname itself has been derived  from a chief ancestor called Giolla Riabhach  (Gilrea), numbering in the ninety-fifth gen-  eration of the family pedigree, 'riabhach'  (rea), being Gaelic for 'grey' or 'swarthy.'  Of this family was Sir John Gray, a member  of the British parliament, who was born at  Claremorris, county Mayo, in 1816, died at  Bath, England, in 1875. A great number of  families bearing the name of Gray or Grey  are given in heraldic w'orks as having the right  to bear arms. The coat-of-arms of one of  these families is thus heraldically described :  Quarterly, ist and 4th, gules with a bordure  engraved a lion rampant argent ; 2n(l and 3rd,  quarterly, ist and 4th, ermine two bars vert;  2nd and 3rd, argent a fesse azure, between  an eagle displayed with two heads in chief and  a lion rampant in base sable. Crest : Out of  a mural crown a phoenix in flames proper.  Mottoes: Over the crest: Clarior ct tencbris;  under the arms : Vixt liber et mortar.   (I) Alexander Gray, the first ancestor in  America of the Gray family, was born in Ire-  land, and came to the United States in 1795.  He died at Philadelphia soon after his arrival.  Alexander Gray came of excellent stock and  occupied a good position both in his native  country and here. He was a fairly young     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     man at the time of his death, and was at the  start of a commercial career that promised to  accomplisli great things. He married Mary  Little, a lady of the Clinton family, dis-  tinguished in the revolutionary annals of New  York, and after her husband's death she be-  came the second wife of her deceased hus-  band's cousin, General James Clinton, the rev-  olutionary soldier. By his first wife, Mary  De Witt, General James Clinton was the father  of one of the most famous men of New York  state, De Witt Clinton, governor of New York,  and creator of the Erie canal. The ancient  form of the Clinton surname was MacClin-  tain, which resolved into its Gaelic elements  is 'Mac giolla Fintain,' meaning 'the son of  the votary or devoted of St. Fintain.' An  ancestor of the family appears to have been  William Clinton or Clintain, who was for some  time an officer in the army of Charles I. of  England. His son, James Clinton, married  Elizabeth Smith, whose father had been a cap-  tain in the parliamentary army during the  civil war, and it was their son, according to  one authority, who came to New York in  1729, and established the settlement of Little  Britain in Ulster, now Orange county. New  York. James Clinton was born in Ireland in  1690, died in 1773. His most celebrated sons  were General James Clinton, the stepfather  of John Gray, and the Hon. George Clinton,  who was born in 1739, died in 1812, an<l who  was one of the most prominent and active  revolutionary patriots during the agitation  which preceded the outbreak of active hostili-  ties with England, and a member of the con-  tinental congress. He afterwards became the  first governor of the state of New York and  later vice-president of the LTnited States. The  children of Alexander and Mary (Little)  Gray included John, mentioned below.   (H) John, son of Alexander and Mary  (Little) Gray, was born in Ireland, died in  1816, at Little Britain. Orange county. New  York. He married Kathrine Scott. Among  their children was John Alexander Clinton,  mentioned below.   (Ill) John Alexander Clinton, son of John  and Kathrine (Scott) Gray, was born in 1815.  in the Clinton mansion at Little Britain,  Orange county. New York, died in 1898. He  received his education in various schools in  Orange county and New York City, and from     471   boyhood was a resident of New York City,  entering business life at an early age and re-  tiring in the year 1852. He remained interested  in various railroad enterprises following his  retirement from an active commercial life, but  nnich of his time was passed in Europe and  devoted to travel. When the original Central  Park commission was formed Mr. Gray was  its vice-president. He married, in 1837, Susan  M., daughter of George Zabriskie, a prominent  citizen of New York, an alderman of the city,  and a member of the state assembly. Mrs.  Gray was a descendant in the sixth generation  of Albrecht Zaborowsky, a native of Poland,  who came from Prussia to New Amsterdam  in 1662, and took up his residence in New  Jersey, purchasing lands at Paramus. His  son, Jan, married Margaretta Duryea. and his  grandson, Joost, married Annetje Terhune,  daughter of John Terhune, while his de-  scendants have been since prominent both in  New Jersey and New York and have become  allied with the oldest families in both states.  Children of John Alexander Clinton and  Susan M. (Zabriskie) Gray: i. George Za-  briskie, born in New York, July 14, 1838. He  graduated at the University of New York in  1858, and studied at the Theological Seminary  at Alexandria until the outbreak of the civil  war, when he concluded his course at the the-  ological school in Philadelphia anrl was grad-  uated in 1862. He was admitted to the  diaconate by Bishop Horatio Potter in the  same year and ordained to the priesthood in  1863. After doing temporary clerical duty in  several parishes he was appointed rector at St.  Paul's Church, Kinderhook, New York, in  1862, and rector of Trinity Church at Ber-  gen Point, New York, in 1865, resigning in  1876 to become dean of the Episcopal  Theological School at Cambridge. Massachu-  setts. Dean Gray was a loyal, broad and  liberal-minded churchman, and as such left a  strong impression of his personality upon the  theological school of which he was so long  the head. For many years he was one of the  acknowledged leaders of the Episcopal church.  He was of a genial temperament and acquired  the respect and personal aflfection of the stu-  dents with whom he came in contact, as he  did of all others who knew him. He was  benevolent and gave great and unostentatious  assistance to many a young man who needed     472     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     help at the beginning of a career. In 1862  he married Kate, liaiigliter of George Forrest,  of New York. He pubHshed besides poems,  sermons and addresses, 'The Children's  Crusade : An Episode of the Thirteenth Cen-  tury' (1871); of which the 'Saturday Re-  view' wrote: 'If we cannot think highly of  Mr. Gray as a critical historian, we are  obliged to him for giving us in an accessible  form all that is known from various sources  of this weird tale, which has never we believe  been told so fully before.' 'The Scriptural  Doctrine of Recognition in the World to  Come' (1875) ; 'Husband and Wife: or The  Theory of Marriage and Its Consequences'  (1885); and 'The Church's Certain Faith,'  Baldwin lectures from 1889 (Boston, 1890).  2 .Alhert Zabriskie, born at New York, March  2, 1840. died at Sharon Springs, New York,  August 4, 1889. He was also a clergyman of  the Protestant Episcopal church, having grad-  uated from the General Theological Seminary,  New York, in 1864. He served as chaplain in  the field for the Fourth Massachu,=etts Cavalry  during the civil war, and after holding various  pastorates became warden of Racine College,  Wisconsin. In 1889 he received the degree  of Doct r of Divinity from Columbia College.  He was associated with church reform work  and reunion in Europe, that was undertaken  by his church, and he was a delegate to the  general convention in 1886. 3. John Clinton,  mentioned below.   (IV) John Clinton, youngest son of John  Alexander Clinton and Susan M. (Zabriskie)  Gray, was born in New York, December 4,  1843. He received part of his education at  the University of Berlin, Prussia, and grad-  uated in 1864 from the University of the City  of New York with the degree of A. M. He  was graduated from Harvard Law School in  1866, and practiced in New York from 1866  to 188S, earning the highest honors of the  legal profession in New York. In 1888 Gov-  ernor Hill appointed him to fill the vacancy in  the court of appeals, caused by the death of  Judge Charles A. Rapallo, and at the election  held that year he was chosen for the full term  of fourteen years. Judge Gray was a mem-  ber of the Har .A^^^ociation. and of the Metro-  politan, Manhattan, Century, and Union  I.eague clubs, and of the National Academy  of Design and the Metropolitan Museum of     Art.

He married, at New York,  June 12, 1907, Marian Anthon, born at Gar-  rison, New York, August 2, 1S80, daughter  of Stuyvesant and Marian G. (Anthon) Fish.  They have one child: Marian Natalie, born  in New York City, March 2, 19 12.     This family name has been vari-  WILDE ously spelled in such ways as  Wild, Wilde, Weld, Welde,  Wyld, Wylde, Wilds and Wildes. As a con-  sequence one who is interested in this fam-  ily's record must make the research among  the archives of the old New England towns  not for Wild or Wilde alone, but seek descend-  ants who have employed the many different  spellings of the name. The family has had  existence in this country now approaching two  centuries, and started as New England settlers  in Colonial days.   The first of the name in America were John  and William Wilde or Wild. They were pas-  sengers aboard the 'Elizabeth,' whose captain  was William Stagg, sailing from London, Eng-  land, in 1635, for New England, as appears by  the ship's list. According to the entry made  therein. William Wild was thirty years old.  John was put down as aged seventeen, and  with them was one Alice Wild, subscribed as  being forty years old. This variance in the  ages, seventeen and forty years, would show  that John and Alice were not brother and sis-  ter ; but she could have been his mother, and  again, she might have been a sister of William,  ten years a senior. William Wild's age is set  forth also in the records of the London Cus-  tom House as having been thirty in the year  1635; hence he was born about 1605, and was  thirty years old on arrival here. Accepting  the statement regarding John also as true, he  was born in the year 1618.   On account of the relationship of the two  males by the name of Wild arriving by the     same sailing vessel, it is interesting to follow  the course of William. He settled in Ipswich,  Massachusetts, between the years 1635 and  1638, the latter being the date on which his  name is entered on town records, connected  with a grant of land to Henry Wilkinson, the  exact date of which is July 25, 1638. From  this it is natural to suppose he had been resid-  ing there some time previous. The location  of this tract, showing where William Wild or  Wilde had his place, is described as follows  in an old deed: 'Granted to Henry Wilkinson  by the company of freeman, 1635, three acres  of planting ground on the south syde the  Towne River. Also hee is possessed of three  acres adjoining unto the same, the which latter  three acres hee bought of Robert Hayes, and  was granted unto ye sayde Robert Hayes at  the same tyme the whole six acres, having a  plaining lott of Ixobert Cross on the East, and  a house lott of John Dayne's on the west, also  on the same syde a planting lott of William  Wildes, buting upon the north end upon the  river. Also three acres of planting ground  lying upon Sogamore Hill, having .Vndrew  Story's lott on the Southeast, and Michaell  Williamson's lott on the Northeast.''   William Wilde removed to the town of Row-  ley as early as 1643, for the records show that  he had a house-lot on Bradford street, 'con-  taining an Acree and an halfe bounded on the  South by Thomas Palmer's house-lott ; part of  it lying on the \\'est side and part of it on the  East side of the streets.' He likewise received  the same year, grants of 48 acres of pasture  land, marsh and upland in Rowley, and that  he accumulated much wealth is shown by the  various deeds. Most of it was bordering on  the Merrimac river, and described as excellent  pasture land. He was entered a freeman of  Rowley, January 31, 1646. After that time,  he apears to have owned property at Ipswich,  and there worked as a carpenter. In this con-  nection he was engaged by the selectmen in  January, 1656, to build a wharf for the town's  use, and for 'the oversight and caring on of  the carpenter's work.' He was appointed fence  viewer in 1658. His will was drawn Septem-  ber 30, 1662, and names Theophilus Willson.  William White and Robert Lord as executors;  his wife. Elizabeth, the sole executrix. Among  the curious pieces of property he bequeathed.  are: 'One ewe lamb, fowling-peece. one bed-     474     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     sted strawbed flock boulster blankett & cover-  lett, 4 paire of stockens; 6 old axes; three  oxen.' Whilst the name of Elizabeth, his  wife, is mentioned by him in his will, her name  rarely is found on any other record than the  document signed by her in 1652, when she con-  sented to a sale of land in Ipswich. William  Wilde died some time between the signing of  his will. May 6, and its probation, September  30, 1662. His widow married, November 6,  1662, Richard Moore, of Lynn, Massachusetts,  whicli was barely five weeks after his burial  hail taken place.   William and Elizabeth Wilde had a son  named Ephraim. He removed from the fam-  ily home to Topsfield ; married, and had a fam-  ily of size, sixteen children. Ten of these were  sons and six were daughters. It is reported  that the entire population of his family, these  sixteen children, were gathered at one time  about his table and made a charming circle  about his hearth, although they had separated,  each seeking fortune in other localities.   Of the children of Ephraim Wilde, his son  of same name, either had no family, or re-  moved. The second child. Jacob, married  Ruth Foster, by whom Jacob, John, Ephraim,  Mary, (who married Ebenezer Emmons),  Ruth (who married Jacob Rhodes), and Doro-  thy (who married Gideon Merrill). Ephraim,  the son of Ephraim and grandson of William  Wilde, having for his first child Jacob, the  same married Abigail Stevens, by whom Sarah,  who married Christopher Gillpatrick ; Jacob,  died young; Jacob (again), died young; Jacob  (third child of same name) died at sea; Lucy,  who married Jacob Durrell ; Israel, who mar-  ried Betsey Penisks ; William, who married  Mar\' I.nvewell : Joseph; a child, died young;  Jacob Wilde, father of these children, re-mar-  ried T,ydia Ranks, by whom no children.   John Wilde, the third son of Ephraim and  grandson of William Wilde, married Jane  Stone and had children: John, died young;  Lydia, married Alexander Thompson ;  Thomas ; Dixey, married Theodosia Bragdon.  and moved to Boston.   Ephraim Wilde, the fourth son of Ephraim  and grandson of William Wilde, married Tem-  perance Downing; and had children: Ephraim,  died young; Mary, married (first) Thomas  I,ec. married (second) Mr. Neally ; Lydia.  died young; Ruth, married Cephas Smith;     Phoebe, married John Taylor; John, died at  sea; Jacob, married Ruth Smith.   Samuel Wilde, the fifth son of Ephraim and  grandson of William Wilde, was employed  several years as a schoolmaster. His children:  Samuel ; John, died at sea while aboard a  Salem privateer engaged in the Revolutionary  war ; Hannah, married Peter Deshon ; Sally,  married Mr. Pitts ; Betsey, married James  Deshon ; Mary, married Dagger Mitchell ;  Susannah, married Nicholas Weeks.-   Samuel \\'ilde Jr., first-born of Samuel and  great-grandson of William Wilde, who came  to America in 1635, married Olive Deshon, by  whom: Mehitabel, Samuel, Ephraim, John,  Persis, Jacob, Isaac, Polly, Sally.   Such is the descent of William Wilde from  the time of his arrival in 1O35, until the rev-  olution, or down to the year 1800. It is note-  worthy and peculiar that in this line and in  the one to be considered next, almost every  generation's family had children named John,  Samuel and Sarah, and this has led to some  confusion in separating the lines.   (I) John W'ilde, supposedly the younger  brother of William, and who had come to  America in the ship 'Elizabeth,' in 1635, when  recorded as being seventeen years old, was  born in England in 1618. He chose Ipswich,  Massachusetts, as his place for settling. In  the year 1637, the settlers were engaged in a  fierce struggle with the Pequot Indians, and  he was one of the men of Ipswich who served  in the patriotic cause. For this service he re-  ceived three shillings ; but his name also ap-  pears as one having done somewhat greater  duty, or at least as being the recipient of  greater reward than that trivial sum, for his  name is on the list of soldiers to whom it was  agreed that each soldier for his service to  tlic Indians shall be allowed 12 shillings a day,  dated December 4, 1643.   He removed to New Meadows, or Topsfield,  between 1645 and 1648, or near the time he  married Priscilla, daughter of Zaccheus Gould.  His first public record there which he left to  us is of a deed dated July 15, 1654, given by  John Wilds, carpenter, to Robert Andrews, for  twentv acres of upland. It lias been previous-  ly shown from records that the William Wilde,  with whom he had come to this country, had  removed, after 1646. to Ipswich, and was a  carpenter there when elected an overseer of     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     475     carpenter work upon the wharf. The families  of the two men, WilHam and John, first emi-  grants of the family, therefore kept together  in selecting localities in which to reside.   John Wilde shared in the 'Common,' in  1661. He was chosen to view fences, in  March, 1677-78; took the oath of allegiance  the same year; served on the committee to  lay out the land, as a surveyor, and was dele-  gated eleven times between 1663 and 1686, to  run bounds ; was chosen juryman for the Ips-  wich Court, March 2, 1679-80; chosen 'to  looke that men Ring thare swine according  to towne order,' May 10, 1680; made member  of a committee to confer with Mr. Danforth  'for his Continuing with us at topsfeeld in  the work of the minestr,' in t68o. John Wilde  and his wife, Priscilla Gould, were members  in full communi n of the Topsfield church.  She died in 1662. and he married, November'  23, 1663, Sarah Averill. After the death of  his first wife, his relations with her family  were no longer amicable, for he became one  of the principal witnesses against his brother-  in-law, Lieutenant John Gould, who was  charged with treason, .A^ugust 5, 1686. During  the storm against witchcraft which disturbed  Essex county, the Wilde family members were  brought prominently into notice, and tlie wife,  two daughters and a son-in-law of his were  imprisoned. She, Sarah, was convicted of  witchcraft, and executed.   From an entirely different source, we have  it that John Wilde was a resident of South  Braintree, Massachusetts, in the year 1688,  and that in 1690 he married Sarah Hayden,  granddaughter of Richard Thayer, of that  place.   The Braintree vital records, begun by Henry  Addams in 1643 and covering more than a cen-  tury, now to be found in printed form, show  only the following records of the Wilde family.  Hannah Wild (or Wilde) died November 12.  1719. John Wild died March 29. 1721. Elijah  Wild, son of William Wild, died July 29. 1727.  John Wild died October 14, 1750. Jonathan  Wild died July 16, 1756, 'with an awfull  Protubernace on his back, attended with a  cancerous humor that spread on his body and  rose to nig-h the bigness of a half bushell.'  Esther Wild born September 5, 1762, dausrhter  of Randell and Jerusha Wild. If John Wilde  was born in 1618, as it was recorded, it is im-     possible to Igure that he was one of those  mentioned above ; but another record gives the  death of John Wilde at Braintree, whose will  was dated on June 28, 1727, and who was  buried October 24, 1732.   John Wilde married (first) Sarah Hayden,  who was born March 27, 1663, and died Feb-  ruary I, 1725. Her gravestone bears inscrip-  tion of her death as January 29, 1724, aged  56 years and 1 1 months. It seems likely that  the person who gave the former date copied  the date of her interment, reading in some  record. 'February i, 1724-25,' and that she  died January 29. Such understanding would  satisfy both statements. Sarah Hayden Wilde  was the daughter of Samuel Hayden and Han-  nah Thayer. John Wilde married (second)  Mary Hollis, daughter of John and Susannah  Hollis ; but had no children by her. The chil-  dren of John and Sarah (Hayden) Wilde  were : John ; Samuel, see forward ; William ;  Sarah ; Jonathan.   (II) Samuel, son of John and Sarah (Hay-  den) Wilde, was born at Braintree, Massa-  chusetts. March 18, 1693. He married, Feb-  ruary 18, 1716, Bethiah Copeland. She was  born March 19, 1694, died June 2, 1761,  daughter of John Copeland (.son of Lawrence  and Lydia Copeland. a descendant of Law-  rence Copeland. a Pilgrim father, who landed  in 1620. at Plymouth) and his wife Ruth, a  daughter of John and Ruth Newcomb The  children of Samuel and Bethiah (Copeland)  Wilde were: i.

This name is obviously  WHITEHOUSE Anglo-Saxon in origin.   and is evidently derived  like a great number of English, and still more  Norman names, from an obiect on the land-  scape. It is moreover the name of a town or  place in the north of England, and some fam-  ilies bearing the name, thev are not verv num-  erous, mav ha\'e been associated with that or     a similarly named locality. For many genera-  tions the members of the Whitehouse family  here dealt with were principally clergymen  of the Church of England, though many bear-  ers of the name also acquired distinction in  the navy, the law, the diplomatic service, arch-  itecture, and in the various branches of art  and science.   (I) James Whitehouse. the first American  immigrant of the family grown up on Ameri-  can soil, was born at Taunton, Somersetshire,  England, and came to this country and estab-  lished himself in New York City, in 1798  He married, in England, Elizabeth Christiana,  daughter of Pompey Norman, squire of Taun-  ton, Somersetshire, England. Children : Henry  John, mentioned below ; Edward, mentioned  below.   (II) Henry John, the eldest son of James  and Elizabeth Whitehouse, was born in New  York City, August 19, 1803. died in Chicago,  Illinois, August 10, 1874. He became famous  as the first Protestant Episcopal bishop of  Illinois. He was graduated at Colnnihia in  1821, and at the Protestant Episcopal Theo-  logical Seminary, New York City, in 1824.  He was ordained deacon by Bishop William  White in St. James' Church. Philadelphia,  August 26, 1827, and immediately entered  upon the ministry in Reading. Pennsylvania,  from which he was called to St. Luke's parish,  Rochester, New York, where he remained fif-  teen years, attaining a wide reputation as a  pastor and preacher ; was rector of St. Thomis  Church. New York City, from 1844 to 1851,  when he was elected assistant bishop of Illi-  nois, to which see on the death of Bishop  Philander Chase he succeeded on September  20, 1852. While in England in 1867 Bishop  Whitehouse delivered the opening sermon be-  fore the first Pan-Anglican conference at Lam-  beth Palace, London, by invitation of the  Archbishop of Canterbury, and it was due  to the advice of Bishop Whitehouse that in-  vitations were extended to the American  bishops. Oxford gave him the degree of Doc-  tor of Divinity and Cambridge that of Doctor  of Laws, while Columbia had given him the  degree of Doctor of Laws in 1865. Bishop  Whitehouse was one of the most accomplished  prelates of the Episcopal church, uniting  versatilitv of talent with great learning He  was a brilliant orator and controversationalist.     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     'Nor one in ten thousand,' says Bishop Henry  W. Lee, of Iowa, in his memorial sermon,  'had such ready command of words and such  precision of diction as mark his written and  spoken productions.' His views had great  weight in the House of Bishops, and among  foreign communions his influence did much  to secure greater consideration for his own  church. In the Cheney case, which precipitated  the formation of the Reformed Episcopal  church, he defended the church's standard of  baptismal doctrine. He was the first bishop  of this church to advocate the adoption in this  country of the cathedral system, which he did  in his first diocesan address. Though highly  cultured and deeply learned he left no pub-  lished works other than his annual addresses  contained in the journals of the diocese of  Illinois from 1853 to 1873. His son, Frederick  Cope Whitehouse, who graduated from Col-  umbia College in 1861, devoted his life and  fortune to archaeology and exploration, being  one of the most eminent Egyptologists of the  age. His discoveries regarding the situation  of the classical Lake Moeris are well known,  and his writings upon that and other subjects  pertaining to ancient Egypt are of an author-  itative nature.   (IT) Edward, youngest son of James and  Elizabeth Whitehouse. was born in New York  City in 1806. He married Julia Cammann of  the Knickerbocker family of that name. His  children were : Edward M., mentioned below ;  James Henry : Julia ; Maria, wife of .Alex-  ander Blake ; Emily ; Adelaide, wife of Charles  Austin : George Meredith.   (III) Edward M., son of Edward and Julia  (Cammann) Whitehouse, was born in New  York City. His education was received in  both England and America. He married  Amelia Stuart Worthington, daughter of  Henry Rossiter and Sara Jane (Newton)  Worthington, the latter a daughter of Com-  modore John Thomas Newton. United States  Navy, of Virginia. Henry R. Worthington  belonged to the Worthington family going back  to 1632, when the first ancestor came from  England and settled at Colchester. Massachu-  setts. Henry Rossiter Worthington was the  only son of Asa Worthington, of Irvington.  and was the inventor of the hydraulic pump  ■which bears his name.   (IV) Worthington. son of Edward M. and     479   Amelia Stuart (Worthington) Whitehouse,  was born at Irvington-on-thc-lludson. He re-  ceived his education in New York, taking a  course in St. John's School, and then going  abroad to complete his studies. He spent three  years in travel, visiting Africa and many other  places of interest. He then returned to his  native land and entered the ofiice of Edward  Sweet & Company, bankers, remaining with  them three years. He then engaged in the  real estate business with Edward Ludlow Hall,  and later formed a partnership with iMr. Mills,  the firm being known as Mills & Whitehouse.  This partnership was dissolved and the firm  became known as Golding & Whitehouse. and  later as Whitehouse & Porter, his partner,  Clarence Porter, being the only surviving son  of General Horace Porter, ambassador to  France. At present he is the senior member  of the firm of Worthington W'hitehouse, which  has transacted much business in renting and  selling residential properties in New York  (particularly in the Fifth avenue and Murray  Hill sections) and also at Newport and other  fashionable watering places, where they have  agents. He is very prominent socially and is  a noted cotillion leader. He belongs to the  Knickerbocker, Racquet and Tennis clubs, and  is also a member of the Delta Phi fraternity.  His summer home is at W^orthington, West-  chester county. New York. His city address  is the Knickerbocker Club, New York.   Edward, the brother of Mr. Worthington  W'hitehouse, is deceased, but his only child,  Edwina, survives him. Among the ancestors  was one Martling, who was noted for his  bravery in the French and Indian wars, and  whose body reposes in the old Dutch cemetery  at Elmsford, within a half mile of the W^orth-  ington farm. This farm came later into the  possession of the mother of Mr. Whitehouse,  who after the death of her first husband con-  tracted a second alliance, this time with  Thomas Whiteside Rae, of the United States  navy. Mr. Rae is deceased, and his widow  resided on the farm situated in the town of  Greenburg. W^estchester county, with her sons,  Worthington W^hitehouse and Izard Newton  Whiteside Rae, up to the time of her death  in 1901. She rests with other members of the  W^orthington family in the crypt of the Worth-  ington Memorial Church at Worthinn-tnn  This church is a fine stone edifice erected by     4i)0     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     the grandmother, Mrs. Sarah Worthington, in  memory of her husband, Henry Rossiter  Worthington.     The surname Cruikshank  CRUIKSHANK is Scottish in its history  and associations, but  English in its origin. Genuine Scottish names  are Gaelic in origin, but occasionally these  names are translated or transmuted into an  English form, or the family may have des-  cended into a district where English influence  was predominating before the establishment  of surnames, and in course of time assumed  an English surname. Examples of Gaelic sur  names translated into an English form are Al-  lison from MacAlister, Ferguson from Mac-  Fergus, Anderson from MacAindris or Mac-  Andrews, Nicholson from MacNicail, Fox  from O'Sionnach, and so on. Cruikshank may  in its earlier form have been a Gaelic sobriquet  applied to a warrior, according to the ancient  Gaelic fashion, in consonance with some phy-  sical peculiarity. It may have been a term  applied in old English. It is probable that its  origin was in a Gaelic appclation ajijilicd to  a remote warrior, and this appellation being  inherited by his descendants as a family name,  was translated into the invading dialect of the  north of England and so transmitted to later  descendants. The name is an honored one in  Scottish history, and has been distinguished  in literature, in war, and in the professions.  There are or have been something like six  families, according to the notes of 'Burke's  Heraldry,' that have borne the name and that  have been entitled to bear arms. Conspicuous  among these families is the Cruikshank fam-  ily of Lanley Park, county of Forfar, Scot-  land. The arms of this family are heraldically  described thus : 'Or, three boars heads couped  sa., armed of the field and langued gu within  a bordure of the last.' Crest : An armed hand,  holding a dagger in pale ppr. Motto : Cavendo  tut is.

The family name of Sims is a con-  .SIMS traction of Simon or Simeon, the   son of Sim. To arrive at the de-  rivation of this name with its association to  the family, one must follow the historical line  for several generations before William the  Conqueror made the Norman conquest, 1066,  and study Scotland's lore. Simon was then  often written Symon, and its contraction Sym  or Sime. Symes is another variation, and cen-  turies ago there was established in Scotland  the place called Symington, in the northwest  of Kyle, Ayrshire, Scotland, originally Sym-  onstown, so called from Simon Lockard or  Lcckart, who held the lands under Walter,  the first Stewart. Those of the generation  living in England at the time the immigrant  came to America, wrote the name Simm ; but  when John Simm came to this country, he  changed the final 'm' into 's,' and wrote  his name Sims, which form has been followed  ever since by his descendants. The Sims  arms: Gules, a chevron between two spur  rowels in chief and a halbert in base, or.  Crest: A demi-lion rampant, proper, holding  between the paws a battleaxe. or. Motto:  Fcrio tcgo. The descendants of Thomas Sym.  of Newton. England, and Anne Martindale,  about T550 (from whom those in .America  are descended), are entitled to quarter the fol-     lowing arms: Martindale: Argent, two bars  gules over all a bend azure. Brisco: Argent,  three greyhounds courant in pale, sable. Fal-  con: Or, a chevron azure, between three fal-  cons close, proper. Connell: Argent, a chev-  ron gules between two suprs in chief, and a  battleaxe in base azure, shaft or.   The commencement of the history of the  Sims family takes one back one thousand  years to Sym of Yetheram Tower, Roxburg-  shire, Scotland. The name of that place was  also written Whitram, Wythrop and Yeth-  throp. His son, known as Sym of Yetheram  Tower, married Ada, the granddaughter of  Oswulfe, earl of Northumberland, Thane of  Gilles Land, in the county of Cumberland,  England. The sturdy, early Romans had  erected a wall, indications of which are today  very apparent, which separated the lands of  the peoples united by this marriage, and it may  have the sound of romance, it may be more  than likely true, that when making their cus-  tomary raids into another's territory, he, of  the north, carried back not only booty but a  bride, for such acts were of common occur-  rence then. Succeeding generations overran  the border lands, and finally by intermarriages  located in Cumberland and Northumberland,  and were patriots among the English, ready to  resist invaders with them, for Bueth Sym.  the son of the parents mentioned, was slain  in the Norman conquest in the year 1066.   It is possible to trace the line of descent for  twenty-five generations, ending wi*^!! the op'  who came to America, and this will be done  in briefest form.   (I) Sym of Yetheram i'owev.

He served some time  as a surgeon during the revolutionary war,  and was one of the original members of the  New Jersey Society of the Cincinnati. Dr.  John Ross, son of Dr. Alexander Ross, was  commissioned a captain in the Third New  Jersey Regiment, February 9, 1776, and major  of the Second New Jersey Regiment, April  7. 1779- Subsequently, he was commissioned  brigade-major and inspector of the Jersey  Brigade, and on December 18, T782, lieutenant-  colonel of the Second New Jersey Regiment.

XXVII) Judec Clifl^ord Stanlev Smis. son  of John Clarke and Emeline Marian (Clark)  Sims was born at Emeline Furnace, near  Dauphin, Dauphin county. Pennsylvania, Feb-     484     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     ruary 17, 1839, died at Trentcn, New Jer-  sey, March 3, 1896. He was educated at the  Episcopal Academy, in Philadelphia, and be-  gan the study of law when only seventeen  years old, so that when he was admitted to  the bar. May 6, i860, he was twenty-one years  of age and entering manhood. His father was  interested in Philadelphia journalism at fhat  time, and it was natural that he should be  inclined to literature, his particular bent at  that period being history and genealogy. In  recognition of the latter taste, he was elected  a corresponding member of the New England  Historic Genealogical Society. July 3, 1861,  at an age when few are so enrolled. Even  earlier than that, March 9, 1857, he had be-  come a member of the Historical Society of  Pennsylvania. On July 4, 1861, he was ad-  mitted to the New Jersey Society of the Cin-  cinnati, by virtue of his descent from Major  John Ross. He published his first book in  1862, 'The Origin and Signification of Scot-  tish Surnames ; with a Vocabulary of  Christian Names.' Joel Mimsell, Albanv. a  work of 125 pages, carefully compiled. This  w. rk evinces a degree of scholarship quite re-  markable in a man of twenty-three. In the  meantime he had been delving among the  archives of the New Jersey Cincinnati, with  the result that on July 4, 1862, he submitter'  an historical account of the foundation of that  society, with a list of its original members,  their successors, and other valuable historical  data. It was intended to publish this work,  but the ycung man. starting as an author,  caught the war fever, and enlisted as a pri-  vate in the Twenty-fifth Pennsylvania Infan-  try, September 15. 1862. The regiment vol-  unterred to repel Lee's invasion of Pennsyl-  vania : that general haying been repulsed at  Antietam. the regiment was mustered out of  service October 1, 1862. Young Sims, how-  ever, had already entered the navy, having  been appointed captain's clerk, on the steam  frigate 'Colorado,' September 28, 1862. He  resigned on February 11, 1863. to accept the  higher rank of acting assistant paymaster of  the United States Navy, to which he was com-  missioned March 10, 1863. He did .service  in this postion for nearly a year, most of the  time west of the Mississippi river, where he  took part in a number of scouting expeditions,  capturing prisoners and intercepting the com-     munications of the enemy. On January 27,  1864, he was in a skirmish at Carson's Land-  ing, Mississippi, where he had charge of a  twelve-pound field howitzer on the hurricane  deck of the U. S. gunboat 'Queen City,' while  exposed to the fire of a body of Confederate  infantry at short range. He handled the gun  with great coolness, and so effectively as to  disperse the enemy, for which service he was  thanked by the commanding officer of the  vessel. He was commissioned lieutenant-col-  onel of the Fou'rth Arkansas Infantry. United  States Volunteers, June 22, 1864; but only  two days later had the misfortune to sustain  a slight wound in an engagement at Clarendon.  Arkansas, where he was taken prisoner, and  consequently was never mustered into ser-  vice again. He remained a prisoner for some  time, and was then released on parole ; but  was not exchanged until the close of the war.  when he resigned, June 10, 1865. During the  period of his enforced non-combatancy, he  was by no means idle ; but turned his attention  to the study of the laws of Arkansas. So as-  siduously had he worked that, on September  13, 1864. he was appointed judge advix-ate-  general of that state, with the rank of colonel,  by Governor Isaac Murphy.   At the close of the war. Colonel Sims re-  moved to Tennessee, where he was licensed to  practice law, but various causes induced him  to return to Arkansas, where he had made  many friends. .Accordinely. he settled in  Desha county, and engaged in cotton-planting.  In 1866. he was commissioned United States  deputy marshal for eastern Arkansas. Maior-  General Ord appointed him a iustice of the  peace in 1867. and he was an active magistrate  until the completion of the reconstruction of  the state. On May 18. 1867, he was offered  the presidency of the board of registrars of  Desha county; but declined to accept the of-  fice. Taking a deep interest in the work of  reconstruction, he was elected a delegate to  the constitutional convention of .\rkansa';. No-  vember 5, 1867. and in that bodv his abilities  as a lawver. a scholar and a man of affairs  were recognized by his assignment to a dozen  of the m-^st important committees, of several  of which be was the chairman. As a natural  corollary of his service in that body, he was  appointed. February 12. i8(S8. a commissioner  to prepare a digest of the laws of the state.     SOUTHERN XliW YORK     485     I     Three days later, he was named commissioner  of elections. It was but fitting that one who  had had so large a share in the framing of  the new organic law should have a part in  the passage of the new body of statutes re-  quisite to carry its provisions int .• effect. Ac-  cordingly, on March 13, 1868, Colonel Sims  was elected a member of the House of Rejre-  sentatives, and in the new legislatu; c was  chairman of the committee of ways and nw ms,  and a member of the committee on banks.  Governor Powell Clayton appointed him judge  advocate-general of the state, with rank of  brigadier-general, July 14, 1868. Through  the personal friendship of Senator Simon  Cameron and of Senator Roscoe Conkling.  President Grant appointed him United States  consul for the district of Prescott. Canada,  embracing Ottawa, the capital of the Domin-  ion, April 21, 1869. Besides attending to the  purely commercial duties pertaining to that  position, he conducted a correspondence with  the department of state relative to the action  of the Dominion parliament regarding the  treaty of Washington. He discharged the  duties of this important office with characteris-  tic ability and fidelity, until 1878. when he re-  signed, to accept the more lucrative position  of secretary of the Pennsylvania Company,  and of the Pittsburg, Cincinnati & St. Louis  Railway Company, both connected with the  Pennsylvania railway system.   In 1 88 1, Colonel Sims was appointed gen-  eral assistant in the service of the Pennsyl-  vania Railroad Company. In this capacity he  prepared a series of volumes containing sev-  eral thousand pages, containing the legisla-  tion in Pennsylvania, New York. New Jersey,  Mar>-land and Virginia, relative to the Penn-  sylvania railroad and its several subsidiary  companies. He also spent several years in  studving and perfecting the legal titles of the  New Jersey lines of that great corporation,  and having a more accurate knowledge of their  charters, leases and grants than any one else,  his advice was continually sought in their man-  agement. In 1887 he relinquished this con-  nection, and became the president of the Dela-  ware Company, a construction corporation  which built a number of waterworks in Penn-  sylvania and Ohio, several of which it prac-  tically owned and operated.   When Colonel Sims retired from the Cana-     dian consulship, he took up his residence at  Mount Holly, New Jersey, which was asso-  ciated in his mind with the memories of his  maternal ancestors, John Brainerd, Dr. Alex-  ander Ross and Major John Russ. It was at  that place he spent the remainder of his life.  He was elected president of the New Jersey  Society of the Cincinnati, July 4, 1883. over  whose deliberations he presided with grace  and dignity, even so late as Washington's  Birthday, in 1896, when the society met at  Lakewood, although somewhat of an invalid  at the time. The report prepared by him in  1862, relative to the society, was published  at Albany, under the title, 'the Institution of  the Society of the Cincinnati ; togetiicr with the  roll of the original, hereditary and honorary  members of the Order, in the State of New  Jersey, from 1783 to 1866.' This was a hand-  somely printed octavo volume of seventy-nine  pages, with rubricated title-page. Under his  presidency the New Jersey Society became  one of the most successful, numerically, finan-  cially and socially, in the country, a result at-  tributed to his earnest and capable supervision.   An outcome of his legal studies was the  publication at Albany, in 1870, of a new edi-  tion of Noy's 'Grounds and Maxims: and  also an Analysis of the English Laws.' with  a biographical sketch of the author, which edi-  tion is accepted as a standard work in law  libraries and schools. His extensive investiga-  tions into land titles in the southern or western  section of New Jersey, led to his becoming;  a member of the Council of Proprietors of  West Jersey, a body whose existence dates  back to' the colonial period of New Jersey, two  centuries ago.   The court of errors and appeals of New  Jersey is composed of the nine justices of  the supreme court, and six other judges spe-  cially appointed. As a clever satirist put it,  'Tt consists of six laymen and the court be-  low.' Occasionally a governor has seen fit  to select as one of the 'lay' judges a person  particularlv fitted by legal attaiiiments, and  it was with this view that Colonel Sims was  appointed judge on March 28. i804- He  brought to the bench a mind thoroughly train-  ed for the exercise of the judicial function,  and in every rc-^pect he fulfilled the hiehcst an-  ticipations of his friends in that position. In  the same year, he was licensed to practice law     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     in New Jersey, and thus had the pecuHar dis-  tinction of having been admitted to the bar  of four diiiferent states. In 1895, he received  the degree of D.C.L., from St. Stephen's Col-  lege, New York. He was a deputy from the  diocese of New Jersey to the General Con-  vention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in  1889, 1892 and 1895.   In addition to his membership in the his-  torical societies already mentioned, he was  elected a resident member of the New Jersey  Historical Society, January 15, 1885, and a  corresponding member of the New York His-  torical Society, October 6, 1888. He acquired  extensive information regarding the families  of the Lowlands of Scotland and was ever  ready to place it at the service of others. He  was also proficient in the art of heraldry and  numismatics. In politics he was a Democrat,  and in 1895 was somewhat prominently men-  tioned in western New Jersey for the nomina-  tion of governor, his own county, Burlington,  sending a strong delegation in his favor to the  state convention, but seeing that the Hon.  Alexander T. McGill, the able, upright and  scholarly chancellor of the state, was pre-  ferred by some other sections. Judge Sims  gladly threw his strength to aid in the nomina-  tion of the chancellor, who was a man after  his own heart.   In person. Judge Sims was of medium  height, somewhat large of frame, yet spare  of body, giving the impression of rugged  virility, which was intensified by his square-  cut visage; this aspect, however, was softened  by an indefinable gentleness of expression that  was very winning. There was about him a  masterfulness, a strength of will, a superior  mentality, all modified yet strengthened by his  thorough training and scholarship, that caused  him to be recognized as a man among men.  His inflexible integrity, his high-mindedness,  R'cre the natural outcome of an instinctive  purity that was childlike in its transparency.  These qualities won for him a host of friends  among his social, professional and political  associates, and his death, while on his way  to sit in court, came as a terrible shock.   Judge Clifford Stanlev Sims married, at  Memphis, Tennessee, August 2. 1865, Mary  Josephine Abercrombie, of Roseland. Tennes-  see. She was born at Natchez, Mississippi,  April 14, 1841, and died at Mount Holly. New     Jersey, June 3, 1908. Her father was Charles  Steadman Abercrombie, M. D., of Roseland,  Tennessee, son of Rev. James Abercrombie,  of Philadelphia, and her mother was Mary  Caroline Bowmar. Children: Charles Aber-  crombie, see forward; Clifford Stanley, see  forward; Launcelot Falcon, see forward;  Ralph Abercrombie, born August 23, 1871,  died July 31, 1886; John Clarke, born March  25, 1876, died September 27, 1902; James Pea-  cock, born November 12, 1879, died March 10,  1888; Thomson Neale, born November 12,  1879, died in November, 1912; Ross Brainerd,  born May 11, 1889.   (XX\TII) Charles Abercrombie, son of  Judge Clififord Stanley and Mary Josephine  (Abercrombie) Sims, was born at Memphis.  Tennessee, June 5, 1866, and resides at Ger-  mantown, Pennsylvania. He was educated at  schools in Mount Holly, New Jersey, and filled  various positions on the Pennsylvania rail-  road's engineering corps from 1882 to 1886,  when he was made assistant engineer, having  charge of the construction of the West Vir-  ginia Central railroad, for one vear. In 1887  he was assistant engineer in charge of con-  struction surveys for the Pennsvlvania rail-  road until 1890. when he became managing  partner of Charles A. .Sims &• Company, op-  erating in railroad construction in the eastern  states. He was resident engineer in charge  of the building of the Pennsylvania railroad  ccinipany's stone arch bridge over the Cone-  maugh river which stood the test of the great  Johnstown flood in t88o. Thi-^ same firm built  the four-track stone bridge over the Delaware  river at Trenton. He is a member of tlie So-  ciety of the Cincinnati. Sons of the Revolu-  tion. T.oval Leeion. and other organizations;  is an Episcopalian in religion, and in politics  a Democrat.   Charle<i .Miercr. mliie Sims married, at  Mount TTnllv, New Tersev, .April 21, 1897,  Tulia Watkins, daughter of T. Elfreth Wat-  kins, of the Smiths nian Institution of W'ash-  ineton. D.

Later on he was as-  sistant engineer and engineer of maintenance  of way at Toledo, at Allegheny and at Chica-  go. He was superintendent of Pennsylvania  lines west of Pittsburgli, at Chicago, 1901-02,  and general superintendent of the Baltimore  & Ohio railroad, at New York, 1902-03 ; gen-  eral manager at Baltimore, 1903-05 ; assistant  to president of the Erie railroad, at New York  City, 1905-07 ; second vice-president and gen-  eral manager of the Delaware & Hudson Rail-  road Company, located at Albany, since 1907.  It is through a naturally strong inclination,  backed by the desire to work hard and the  energy to execute, that he was made vice-  president of this important railroad line, and  his experience has counted for much in the  successful administration he has achieved. He  is a director of the Albany Trust Company,  of the Manufacturers' National Bank of Troy,  Bank of Lake Placid, Corn Exchange Bank,  City Bank of Syracuse, Bank of Ausable  Forks, and of the Ulster & Delaware Railroad  and the Casualty Company of America.

A history of New York City  BEEKMAN without a full account of the  Beekman family, which for  over two and a half centuries has been promi-  nently identified with its civic, business, reli-  gious and social life, would be far from com-  plete. The coat of arms of this family is a  bend wavy silver between two gold roses on  a blue field. The crest is, two wings on a hel-  met of steel represented in profile. The motto  is: Mens conscia recti.   (I) The family is of ancient German an-  cestry, dating back to Cornelius Beekman,  who was a prominent citizen of Cologne. He  married Christiana Huygens of that city, who  died December 4. 1560. They had two sons:  Englebert, married Elizabeth de Beyer, and  Gerardus, mentioned below.   (TI) Rev. Gerardus (or Gerard^ Beekman,  son of Cornelius and Christiana (Huygens)  Beekman, was born in Cologne, May 17, 15.58,  and died at Emmerich, January 31. 1625. He  received a University education and studied  theology at Frankcndael, during the years  1576-78. He became one of the most learned  scholars of his time. He is said to have been  able to 'speak, think and dream' in five  languages. He lived in the stirring times  succeeding the religious movement begun by  Martin Luther, when a fanatical warfare was  waged between the Catholics and the followers  of the reformed religion. Rev. Gerard Beek-  man took a prominent part in the support of  the principles of the new church and was  chosen one of the delegates to visit the Duke •  of New Berg, the Elector of Brandenburg and  King James of England to secure their sup-  port in behalf of the reformed religion. He  was one of the distinguished scholars who  translated the Bible from the original manu-  scripts into English for King James L of  England and for his services received especial  honors from the King. In 1616 the Protes-     SOUTH I-.RX NliW YORK     tants were expelled from Cologne by the Cath •  olics. A little later they returned and built  churches, which were again destroyed. They  then went to Mulheini, about three miles from  Cologne, and built a church of which Gerard  Beekman served as superintendent. Later the  church was destroyed and many of its mem-  bers imprisoned. Mr. Beekman, after losing  much of his pro])erty, escaped and found  refuge with the landgrave of Nassau. He  served for some time as secretary of the Elec-  toral Chamber at Cleves. He married Agnes  .Stuning at Cleves. She was born January 13,  1557, and died at Mulheim, March 10, 1614.  Children: i. Harmon, died in 1654. z. John,  became a clergyman, died September 13, 1635.   3. Catherine, died in 1624. 4. Margaretha,  married Rev. N. N. Cnoetz. 5. Hendrick,  mentioned below.   (HI) Hendrick, son of Rev. Gerard and  Agnes (Stuning) Beekman, was born in  Cologne, September 14, 1585, and died at  Wezel, December 2. 1642. He received a  liberal education and for some years was sec-  retary of the city of Hasselden, Oberyssel. In  1629 he was apointed states-general superin-  tendent of the magazines in the cities of Wezel  and Hasselt. He married three times, (first)  April 15, 1613, Gertryd (Gertrude) Gomens-  bach, who died September 10, 1619. Four  children. Tie marriccl (second) Mary Bau-  dertius, at Zutphen, January 24, 1621. She  was the daughter of Rev. William Baudertius  pastor of the Reformed Church at Zutphen.  Seven children were born to Hendrick and  Mary (Baudertius) Beekman: i. Gerard, Feb-  ruary 20, 1622, died in 1678; became a clergy-  man ; married Joanna Plantius and lived in  Avcnnor'i, Nrth Holland. 2. \\'illielmus (or  William, mentioned below. 3. Martin, August  25, 1624, at Ha.sselt, married Maria de Bois.   4. John, November 26, 1625. at Hasselt, died  January 15, 1684; married (first) Alida  Brouwer, and (second) Catharine Van Rys-  vort. 5. Andrew, died unmarried in 1663. 6.  Alida, married Leonard Winnix. 7. Maria.  married William Harris.   (IV) Wilhelmus, second son of Hendrick  and Mary (Baudertius) Bookman was born  at Statselt, Oberyssel, Holland, April 28, 1623,  and died in New York City. September 21.  1707. He made rapid progress in bis studies  and at the age of twenty-one years was an     officer in the Reformed Church. At the age  of twenty-two he was elected a magistrate,  an unusual honor for one so young, and one  that showed that he had ability of a high  order. He became an intimate friend of Pe-  trus Stuyvesant (q. v.), who invited him in  1647 to accompany him to New Netherland.  He accepted the invitation, and through his in-  fluence, a number of German families who had  been obliged to leave their native land and  find an asylum in HoUaiid were allowed to  accompany them to New Amsterdam. The  party left Holland in three ships, the 'Great  Gerrit' (Princess), the 'Swal' and the  'Raid.' The voyage was a long and tem-  pestuous one, being longer then usual, as Gov-  ernor Stuyvesant went via the island of Cur-  acao, where he had to make a brief visit, as  he was given charge of that island as well as  the colony of New Netherland. On this trip  many of the passengers and crew became ill,  and Mr. Beekman served as nurse and phy-  sician. The party reached New Amsterdam  in May, 1647. Scon after his arrival in the  colony he obtained a grant of land on the Hud-  son river for the German families, who had  accompanied him to the colony. The place  where they located they gave the name of  Rhinebeck, so called as a memorial of their  home district, the Rhine in Germany and  'heck.' the shortened or ancient form of the  name Beekman, a compliment to their protec-  tor. Dr. Beekman. On September 24, 1670,  'Anna Hall, widow of Thomas Hall, by vir-  tue of a deed dated August 27, 1654. and con-  firmation of Governor Richard Nicolls. April  15. 1667, sells to William Beekman a parcel  of land with a house, brew^ house, brew kettle  and other brewing instruments, and a mill  house with a horse mill and other buildings,  together with an orchard lying at the east-  ermost end of the .Smiths Valley. Bounded  west southwest by land heretofore of Corne-  lius Van Tienhoven, east southeast by David  Provoost. Stretching in length from the land  of said Tienhoven to Bestavcr's Swamp, forty  rods at twelve feet a rod. In length along the  strand, west southwest, and east northeast,  sixty-eight rods. Northwest and southeast to  the land of said Provoost. In length along  the Sjniths Valley to the fence of the said  David Provoost. forty-eight rods, deducting  out of said land for the use of the said Anna     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     4Sq     Hall, for her life, one half of the orchard, the  eastermost part thereof, as also three hundred  and seventy-five rods more for the highway,  and for a lot of ground which is sold out of  said lot unto Isaac Allerton.' Two days later  we find William Beekman 'inhabitant of the  \illage of Kingstown in the Esopus,' giving  a mortgage to widow Anna Hall for the same  lands to secure the sum of fifteen thousand  guilders. This was paid in 1683. The de-  scription of this farm as given above might be  an enigma to one not acquainted with geogra-  phy of the early city. The south bounds was  the road along the side of the river, and now  Pearl street. The east line was a few feet west  of the present Ferry street ; on the west it was  bounded by the middle line of the block be-  tween Fulton and Ann streets. The 'Bes-  taver's Swamp,' still called 'the swamp,' was  divided among its owners in later years,  and Jacob street (named from Jacobus Roose-  velf) runs through it. The southwest corner  of the farm is at the junction of Pearl and  Fulton streets. A person standing at Fulton  street and looking east will perceive a slight  elevation of land. This is all that now re-  mains of what was called in ancient deeds  'The Hill by William Beekmans.' The  whole of it was known as 'Beekman's Or-  chard and Pasture.' Here tanneries were  built and the leather trade developed. A  street was laid out through this property and  named Beekman street in his honor. William  street, running at right angles to Beekman  street, was also named after his Christian  name, and thus today two important streets  in the great metropolis stand as monuments  to the memory of this worthy immigrant. Dr  Beekman soon becatue prominent in civil af-  fairs of the city. In 1653 he was elected as-  sistant alderman, retaining the office four  vears. In 1654 he was 'schepen,' an office  pertaining both to the duties of a magistrate  and sheriflf. He was orphan master in i6s8  and one of the 'nine men' to regulate public  affairs in 1652. He was elected delegate in  1653, and in 1658 he was made vice-governor  of the South River colony, the Swedish settle-  ment which Governor Stuyvesant had con-  quered and which was sold to New .Amster-  dam by the Dutch West India Company. He  was later promoted governor. In 1664 he  served as sheriff of New Amsterdam and in     1674 was elected burgomaster, retaining the  office when the English gained control of the  city. He served as alderman until 1696, when  owing to failing health he was forced to re-  tire from active life. His residence was near  the center of his farm, near where Pearl and  Frankfort streets are now located. Here he  made his home until his death. He was one  of the ablest citizens of New York and was  greatly respected and loved by the pe iple of  the city. He married, September 5. 1649,  Katrina de Boog. daughter of Hendrick de  Boog. Children: i. Maria, baptized June 26,  1650; married, January 5. 1672. Nicholas  William, son of Governor Peter Stuyvesant;  she died March 20. 1679. 2. Hendrick or  Henry, baptized March g. 1632, died in 1716;  married Johanna, widow of Joris Davidson,  and daughter of Captain Jacob and Cornelia  (Molyn) de Loper; his son, Colonel Henry  Beekman, attained considerable prominence,  and had a daughter, Margaret, who married  Robert R. Livingston. 3. Gerardns. mentioned  below. 4. Cornelia, baptized in Ai)ril, 1655.  married Isaac Van VIeck, September 19. 1674;  she died April i, 1679. 5. Johannes, bap-  tized November 22, 1656. died in Kingston,  luly 21. 1751: married .Aeltjc Thomas Pop-  inga : he remained in Kingston and the num-  erous Beekmans there are descended from  him. 6. Jacobus, baptized August 21, 1658,  died 1679. 7. Wilhelmus, born 1661, died  unmarried in 1702. 8. Martin, baptized July  10. 1663. 9. Catherine, baptized March 25.  166S. died about 1707.   (V) Dr. Gerardus (2) Beekman. son of  Wilhelmus and Katrina (de Boog^ Beekman,  was baptized in New Amsterdam (New York  Citv), August 17. 1653. died there October  10. 1723. After a liberal preparatory educa-  tion, he studied medicine and practiced his  profession in New York and Flatbush, Long  Island, for manv years. He inherited a large  property froiu bis father, yet he applied him-  self to his professional laboss with the zeal  of a man dependent upon his own resources  to make his wav in the world. He met with  marked success in his professional labors, be-  ing one of the ablest physicians and surgeons  in the province. He was often consulted on  medical matters by physicians in the other  American colonies. At an early date he took  a prominent part in the civil affairs of his     490     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     city. <Tnd though possessing great wealth, he  espoused the cause of the common people in  opposition to the 'aristocratic' party. In  1685 he was appointed justice of King's coun-  ty. New York. In October, 1674, Sir Edmund  New York, and in his zeal to follow his  'master's instructions' made himself odious  to the people of the province, winning his  title of 'tyrant.' One of his outrageous acts  was the imprisonment of leading New York  citizens, among the number being Gerardus  Beekman. During 1688-91 Dr. Beekman was  a loyal supporter of Lieutenant-Governor  Leislcr in his rule of the colony, serving as a  member of his council in 1690 and 1691. Cap-  tain Richard Ingoldsby arrived early in 1691  with a company of regulars and demanded  that Leisler turn over the government to him ;  the request was refused, and for several weeks  the city was stirred by rival factions, 'Leis-  lerians' and 'Anti-Leislerians.' In March,  169T, Governor Sloughter arrived in New  York and Leisler at once loyally turned over  to him the management of affairs. Acting  on the advice of the enemies of Leisler, Gov-  ernor Sloughter arrested Leisler and six ol  his 'inferior insurgents,' Abraham Gouver-  neur, Gerardus Beekman, Johannes Vermilye,  Thomas Williams, Mydert Cocrtcn and Abra-  ham Brasher, on a charge of high treason.  Leisler was executed May 16, 1691, near  where the Tribuiie Building now stands in  New York. Dr. Beekman was tried for trea-  son and sentenced to be hung, but was finally  pardoned by the King in 1694. He then re-  sumed the active practice of his profession.  He regained in a short time his popularity,  and was regarded by the people as a 'martyr'  to the cause of freedom. At an early age he  became identified with the military history of  the province, being commissioned captain of  the militia at Flatbush in 1681. In 1689 he  took the oath of allegiance and was appointed  by the acting governor, Jacob Leisler, major  of 'all the hor^se and foot' in King's county.  In 1700 he was commissioned lieutenant-  colonel by Governor Bellomont, and in 1701  colonel of the militia in the province. He  served as a member of Governor Cornbury's  council. 1702-09, and was acting governor  from September 17, 1709. until June 4, 17 10.  From this last date until his death he was  president of the council. In 1700 he was ap-     pointed judge, retaining the office until his  death. He was the owner of valuable real  estate. Besides his estate in Flatbush he  owned three large farms in New Jersey.   He married, August 29, 1677, Magdalena,  daughter of Stofifel Janse and Neeltje Janse  (Croon) Abell. of Albany. She was born  in 1657 and died October 20, 1745. Children:  I. William, born January 25, 1679. died  young. 2.

He served as a  member of the 'committee of one hundred'  in 1775. and from 1775 to 1777 was a mem-  ber of the provincial legislature. He inherited  a large property, which he greatly increased  through his able management, and owned a  goodly estate on 'Beekman Hill,' where in  1764 he built a line house between 'Kissing  Bridge' and the East river near Fifty-first  street and First avenue. This house became  famous during the revolutionary war. Here  General Howe made his headquarters for  some time in 1776, and in the greenhouse  nearby Captain Nathan Hale was tried and  condemned to be hung. The house was also  occupied by Generals Chester and Carleton,  and by Baron Riedsel in 1780. Major Andre  passed the night at the Beekman mansion be-  fore proceeding up the Hudson to meet Gen-  eral Benedict Arnold. George Wa.shington,  after becoming president, was frequently en-  tertained by James Beekman at this estate.

He was an active  member of the church and gave generously  to its various benevolences. He married, in  .April. 1810. Catharine Sanders, of .Schenec-  tady, daughter of Captain John and Catharine  (Sanders) Sanders. She was born October  TO, 1785, and died October 15, 1835. Her  mother was a daughter of Hon. Robert San-  ders, a prominent citizen of .A.lbany, New  York, serving as mayor of the city during the  years 1750-54. One child: James ^Villiam.  mentioned below.   (IX) James William, .son of Gerard and  Catharine (Sanders) Beekman. was born at  553 Broadway, New York. November 22.  1815, died there June 15. 1877. He was pre-  pared for college by private tutors and in  1830 entered Columbia University, graduating  in 1834. with the degree of Bachelor of Arts.  He then studied law and was admitted to the  bar in \St,C\ but never actively practiced the     SOUTH KRN NEW YORK     A'Ji     profession. He made extensive trips tlirough  the northern states in the summers of 1834-  2/. In 1838, in company with his college  classmate, Evert A. Duyckinck, he made an  extensive trip through France, Holland, Eng-  land and Scotland, returning in one of the  first steamships that crossed the Atlantic. In-  heriting a large fortune he devoted himself  to the management of his business interests,  and civic and social affairs of his native city.  At an early age he became prominent in the  political aiTairs of the city. He represented  his district in the New York assembly in  1848, and during the years 1849-51 served  in the State senate. He was a member of  several important committees in both the house  and the senate, and took a- prominent part in  securing important changes in the tax laws,  by which the personal liberty of the dehii-  quent tax-payers was unrestrained and ex-  tended time given for payment. He was chair-  man of the senate committee that reported the  bill creating the New York Central Park, and  it was largely due to his earnest advocacy  that the bill became a law. He was especially  interested in educational matters and served  for some time as member of the board of ed-  ucation of New York. He was also a trus-  tee of the Medical Department of Columbia  University from i860 to 1877 and of the imi-  versity from 1875 until 1877. During the  trying times of the civil war he proved an  earnest friend of the government and gave  liberally of his time and money to aid the  Union soldiers. In the early part of 1861 he.  in company with Erastus Corning and Thur-  low Weed, consulted President Buchanan, in  Washington, in regard to giving necessary  protection to the steamer ''Star of the West,'  which had been sent from New York City  loaded with supplies for the beleaguered gar-  rison at Fort Sumter, Charleston, South Caro-  lina. He was an active member of the Dutch  Reformed Church, Fifth Avenue and Twenty-  ninth Street, and gave generously to its many  benevolences. He was greatly interested in  all matters that pertained to the welfare of  humanity, and for many years he made a  study cf hospital construction and administra-  tion, making many trips to Europe to inspect  the hospital conditions on that continent. He  was governor and vice-president of the New  York Hospital from its foundation until his     death; president of the Woman's Hospital for  many years, and trustee of the New York  Dispensary. He was especially active in the  club and society life of the city, being one of  the founders of the Union League Club and  its vice-president for some time. He was for  many years a member and ofticer of the St.  Nicholas Society and the Century Associa-  tion. He was a popular lecturer. Several  of his addresses were published, the most im-  portant being 'The Founders of New York,'  delivered before the St. Nicholas Society in  1869; and 'Report on a Village of Cottage  Hospitals,' made to the governors of the New  York Hospital in February, 1876. This last  work was an exhaustive study of hospital con-  ditions, and is regarded as an authority on  the subject. He was a member of the New  York Historical Society and its vice-president  for several years. He was a worthy descend-  ant of a worthy family. He inherited the  firm religious faith that distinguished his an-  cestors in Germany and Holland, the faith  that made him conspicuous in the church and  benevolent work of the city. He was tolerant  in his views and was ever ready to extend a  helping hand to his less fortunate brothers.  He was a member of the Sabbath Commit-  tee and worked to make the Sabbath a day of  rest. In his zeal in philanthropic work he  often overtaxed his strength, and while per-  forming his duty as an officer in the New  York Hospital he contracted the illness of  which he died, June 15, 1877.   He married, March 18, 1840, Abian Steele  Milledoller, daughter of Rev. Philip Mille-  d Her, president of Rutgers College, New  Jersey. She was born November 22, 1815.  and died January 15, 1877. Five children  were born of this marriage: i. Catharine, mar-  ried William W. Hoppin. a distinguished  lawyer in New York. 2. Gerard, mentioned  below 3. Philip Milledoller, born June 12.  1845, 'I'ccl August 15, 1846. 4. James Wil-  liam, born November 4, 1847, 'l'Cf'> unmar-  ried.

In 1893 was made a Knight of the     494     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Order of Orange Nassau by the Queen Re-  gent of Holland. 5. Cornelia.   (X) Gerard, son of James \N'illiani and  Abian Steele ( Milledoller) Beekman, was  born in New York City. He prepared for  college under private instruction and entered  Columbia University graduating in 1864 with  the degree of Bachelor of Arts, and from Law  School of Columbia in 1867. He is a mem-  ber of the University Club, St. Nicholas So-  ciety, and was for many years a trustee of  Columbia. He has incorporated under the  laws of the State a society for the benefit of  the Beekman family ; the education and care  of any of its members, and other charitable  purposes, and for the preservation of the fam-  ily heirlooms. This is called the Beekman  Family Association. Gerard and James Wil-  liam Beekman presented a stained glass win-  dow to the new chapel in Columbia Univer-  sity on which has been recorded the names  of former graduates of the family name.     On both the paternal and maternal  BULL sides, the Bull family of New   York traces its origin to several of  the oldest and most distinguished New Eng-  land families of the Colonial and Revolu-  tionary periods, the Bulls, the Lanmans, the  Trumbulls, the Bolystons, the Coits and oth-  ers.   (I) Henry P)ull. a native of South Wales,  was bom in 161 o, died in 1693. He came to  America in 1635 and was the progenitor of  all the Bull families of New England. After  a .short residence in the Massachusetts Bay  Colony he went to Rhode Island, being one  of the followers of Roger Williams. Wtih  seventeen associates he purchased land in 163S  and joined in the settlement of Newport, be-  ing at once one of the leading men of the  new colony. He was chosen sergeant of the  town, with the care of the prison included in  the duties of his office. In i68g. when he  was nearly eighty years of age, he accepted  election as governor, when the duty of restor-  ing the charter privileges of the colony after  the fall of Andros made the office one of  arduous labor and heavy responsibilities, so  much so, in fact, that two others declined to  serve in that capacity. He was admitted a  freeman in Massachusetts, May 7, 1637. He  was one of the first fifty-eight followers of     Wheelwright and Mrs. Hutchinson, disarmed  by order of the general court. Henry Bull  was one of the founders of Portsmouth,  Rhode Island, having been associated in that  enterprise with men from Boston and vicin-  ity; this was in 1638. In the following year  he became one of the fonuders of Newport.  He was elected corporal of the train band,  June 27, 1638, chosen sergeant, November  24, 1638, and in 1641-42 lie was designated  as sergeant assistant. In 1655-57 '''^ '^^''^^ ^^'^  of the six commissioners from Newport to  the general court of election at Providence,  and from 1666 to 1681 represented Newport  in the general assembly. In 1674-76 he was  assistant, and in 1685-86 and 1689-90 gover-  nor of Rhode Island.   Henry Bull, according to the Friends' Rec-  ords 'aged about eighty-four years, departed  this life at his home in Newport, he being  the last man of the first settlers of this Rhode  Island, 22nd, iimo. 1693-4'. He was buried  in the Coddington ground, the old Quaker  cemetery on Farewell Street, in Newport.  The records of deeds indicate that he owned  considerable property. The house that he  built on the easterly side of Spring street is  still standing and is in the possession of his  descendants, it being the only one remaining  of those built by the original settlers. On  July 18. 1906, the Rhode Island Historical  Society unveiled a tablet, attached to the house  and inscribed : 'The Gov. Bull house, the old-  est house in Rhode Island. Built in part in  1639 by Henry Bull, Governor under Royal  Charter of the Colony of Rhode Lsland and  Providence Plantations, in the years 1685-6  and 1690.'   He married (first) Elizabeth , who died   October i, 1665, and was buried at Newport.  He married (second) at Sandwich, Massa-  chusetts, Esther Allen, born December 18.  1648, died February 26, 1676. daughter of  Ralph and Esther (Swift) Allen. He mar-  ried (third) March 28, 1677, Ann Clayton,  widow of Governor Nicholas Easton. She  died January 30, 1707, and was buried in the  Coddington cemetery at Newport. Children.  Jiroli, mentioned below: Elizabeth, married  .Allen; .\mey, married Edward Rich-  mond.   (II) Jireh, son of Henrv Bull, was bom  at Pi rtsmouth, Rhode Island, September,     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     495     1638, died in 1684 in Kingstown, probably  He was one of a company who purcliased  land in the Narrangansett Country, June 29.  1660, and he signed articles relating to the  Westerly lands, March 22, 1661. He bought  five hundred acres at Pettequamscott and  thereafter seems to have resided on the west  side of the bay except during King Philip's  war. He and two others were appointed on a  commission to the Indians, August 19, 1669.  By appointment of the governor he was a con-  servator of the peace in 1669-70, 1678 and  1683. He was assessor or rate-maker for  Pettequamscott in 1670; was appointed lieu-  tenant and took the oath of fidelity. May 19,  1671 ; was appointed one of the commissioners  to adjust the Connecticut boundary line. May  14, 1672. Roger Williams in a letter dated  June 27, 1675, to John Winthrop, written from  Richard Smith's at Narragansett, says : 'Just  now comes in Sam Dier in a catch (ketch')  from Newport, to fetch over Jireh Bull's wife  and children and others of Pettequamscott.'  This was on account of King Philip's war and  in December following Bull's garrison house  was burned, ten Englishmen and five women  and children were killed, but two escaping.  After the war Jireh Bull returned to his home  and five hundred acres of land were laid out  to him, December 5, 1679. During the war  he was probably at Newport, for he was on  a commission appointed April 4, 1676, to make  a census of the island, and August 24, 1676.  he served on a^ court-martial to try Indians.  In 1683 services of the Church of England  were read at his house. He died in 1684.   The name of his wife is unknown. It is   thought she was Katherine , on whose   estate administration was granted August 16,  1713.

(The Lanman Line')  The Lanman family, to which Mrs. Frederic  Bull belonged, was of English origin. Its  founder in this country was James Lanman,  of London, 1692-1775, who came to America  about 1700 and settled in Boston. In 1714  he married Joanna, daughter of Dr. Thomas  and Lucy (Gardner) Boylston. of Roxbury,  Massachusetts. He removed to Plymouth,  Massachusetts, in 1724, and there his son,  Peter Lanman, 1725-1804, was born. Peter  Lanman married, in 1764. Sarah Spalding,  daughter of Colonel Samuel Coit, of Preston,  Connecticut. During most of his life Peter  Lanman was a prominent shipping merchant  at Norwich, Connecticut, where he died. The  Coit family was derived from the oldest set-     tlers in Connecticut. Colonel Samuel Coit,  the great-grandfather of Mrs. Frederic Bull,  was a resident of Plainfield and Preston (now  (iriswold), Connecticut. He was born in  Plainfield, in 1708, and his wife, whom he  married, in 1730, was Sarah Spalding, daugh-  ter of Benjamin Spalding, of Plainfield. He  was several times a member of the general  assembly of the state and judge of the  county court. His daughter Sarah was born  in 1743. The parents of Colonel Coit were  the Rev. Joseph and Experience (Wheeler)  Coit, of New London, Connecticut. The Rev.  Joseph Coit, born in 1673. was the son of  Josc])h Coit. of New London, who died in  1704. and his wife. Martha Harris, daughter  of William and Edith Harris, of Wethersfield,  Connecticut ; he was a grandson of the founder  of the family in America, namely, John Coit,  who came hither from Wales, in 1630, and  settled in Salem, Massachusetts, afterward  rem ving to New London. The wife of John  Coit was Mary Gennes. He died in 1659,  and his wife died in 1676.   Peter Lanman, of Norwich, Connecticut,  1771-1854, was a son of Peter and Sarah  Spalding (Coit) Lanman. His wife was Abi-  gail Trumbull. 1781-1861, daughter of David  Trumbull, whose father was Jonathan Trum-  bull, governor of Connecticut from 1769 until  1783, and through the whole period of the  .American revolution a trusted supporter and  confidential adviser of George Washington.  The wife of Governor Trumbull was Faith  Robinson, a direct descendant of John Alden  and Priscilla MuUins. Mary Huntington Lan-  man, who married Frederic Bull (see Bull  VHI), was the daughter of Peter and Abigail  ( Trumbull ) Lanman.     The old Irish or Gaelic form  McCALL of the modern name. McCall   or MacCall, was Mac Cathm-  haoill, which has been anglicized into various  other forms such as MacCaul, Cowell, and  Campbell, etc. There is a great mass of gen-  ealogical literature in existence relating  to this family, which is a branch of the  royal stem of the O'Neills, nionarchs of  Ireland, kings of Ulster, and princes and  earls of Tyrone. The McCall family  was originally seated in Tyrone, and their  official title for many centuries was 'Mac     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     Cathmhaoil, Lords of Cinel-Fearadhaiaigh,'  or Kinel-Farry. The territory of Kinel-  Farry, the patrimonial inheritance of the Mc-  Call family, the members of which were  descendants of Fergal, brotlier of Fergus  Mor, conqueror and first king of Scotland,  both sons of Murrough, son of Eoghan  (Owen), son of the celebrated Niall of the  Nine Hostages, high monarch of Ireland as  well as parts of Britain and Gaul, was nearly  co-extensive with the barony of Clogher in  Tyrone. The Kinel-Fearadhaigh, or in mod-  ern terms, the Farry Clann, viz., the Clan  Aengus (Magennis), Clan Duibhinreacht,  Clan Fogarty, all of the principality of Tyrone,  and the Hy-Kennedy, and Clan Colla, both of  Fermanagh at that time, were under the lead-  ership of the Mac Cathmhaoil, or the MacCall,  prince and chief of Cinel-Fearadhaigh. The  Hy-Kennedy (Hy. Kinel. Clan, Mac, and O  have all the similar meaning of 'children' or  'brethren' in Gaelic) gave name to the barony  of Tir-Kennedy, in the east of Fermanagh,  adjoining the barony of Clogher in Tyrone.  The family and the name of MacCathmhaoil  or McCall are still numerous in the ancient  territory that once was theirs, but is now in  other hands. In 'O'Neill's of Ulster,' by  Matthews, there is contained a topographical  poem by the famous poet or bard, O'Duggan,  written in 1350, a. d., which says:  The festive Cinel Fearadhaigli  Constantly noble are tlieir genealogies  A clan wifliotil disgrace from their arms  And the warlike Clan Cathmhaoil  The two eastern septs are of ev'ry trihe  In the high Cinel Fearadhaigh.  Cinel-Fcaradhaigh or Cinel-Farry, now the  barony of Clogher, Tyrone, was the patrimiony  of the McCalls, who, apart from their military  and politic station, were also Brehons (judges  in the Brehon law) in Tir-Owen or Tyrone,  and are celebrated in Irish history for their  wide learning and the nutTiber of high digni-  taries they supplied to the church. About  1300, A. D., the MacCalls were also hereditary  advisers to the high king of Ireland, and in  that capacity make a rcinarkable figure in the  military historv of the period. Irish annalists  say that a noble belonging to the family, con-  verted by St. Patrick, proceeded to the Isle  of Man, and converted the people of the  islatid to Christianity. His name was Maug-  hold, and a town in the island is called by his     I'ame and was the seat of his bishopric. The  family of Campbell, in Scotland and Ireland,  is a branch of the MacCathmhaoil family, and  the Campbell arms, the gyronny of eight, is  the cominon property of the McCalls. Re-  peated confiscati(jns in Ulster deprived the  McCalls of their property, and they and other  ancient Irish families have become tenants  where they were for so many centuries abso-  lute lords of the soil. The 'Annals of Ulster'  and the 'Annals of the Four Masters' give  graphic accounts of numerous events in the  history of this family. The following is a  skeleton jiedigree of the family taken from  'Irish Pedigrees' by O'Hart:   1.

(I) John McCall, immigrant ancestor of the  McCall family, was born in Ireland, and died  at Albany, New York, in 18R7. He was a  prominent citizen in that city for a period of  fully fifty years, and was held in high esteem     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     499     by his neighbors and fellowtownsmen, and  was frequently honored by public office. He  married Catherine McCormack.   (II) John Augustine McCall, son of John  and Catherine (McCormack) McCall, was  born in Albany, New York, in 1849. He at-  tended the Albany public schools, and was  graduated from the Albany Commercial Col-  lege in 1868. Starting at once into commer-  cial life, he became connected with an Albany  business house, and soon after secured a posi-  tion as bookkeeper in the general agency for  New York and Albany of the Connecticut  Mutual Life Insurance Company. This was  the beginning of his connection with the in-  surance business, and the experience he gained  in that position practically determined his  career. Giving up his position as bookkeeper,  Mr. McCall engaged for a time in the real  estate and insurance business, and then became  a clerk in the State Insurance Department,  under Superintendent George W. Miller.  From March, 1870, to May, 1872, when Mr.  Miller resigned his position, Mr. McCall was  employed in the actuarial branch of the de-  partment. For than twenty years his connec-  tion with the department remained unbroken,  and was a record of steady advancement. In  the spring of 1872 he was put in charge of  the statistical work of the department's re-  ports, and a few months later became an ex-  aminer of companies by appointment of the  new superintendent, the Hon. O. W. Chap-  man. In 1876, when the deputy superintend-  ent of insurance, William Smythe, became the  acting superintendent. Mr. McCall was ad-  vanced to be the deputy superintendent, and  held that position for several years under sev-  eral superintendents. Mr. McCall's long serv-  ice made him thoroughly familiar with many  evils that had crept into the in.surance depart-  ment under previous lax administrations. He  also had a perfect knowledge of the conditions  of the different insurance companies doing  business in the state, some of which were of  a dishonest character. To expose fraudulent  practices and to reform existing evils in the  supervision of the insurance business of the  state was a Herculean task, but to this work  Mr. McCall addressed himself with energy  and uncompromising fidelity. Political and  other influences were brought to bear to stop  his investigations, but in spite of all the diffi-     culties that were placed in his way, he pushed  his work to the end, with the result that many  fire insurance companies and eighteen life in-  surance companies in New York state, and  fifteen companies outside of the state were  forced to go out of business, while three pre-  viously prominent officials of insurance com-  panies were brought to the bar of justice,  charged with fraud and were convicted and  punished by severe sentences of imprisonment.  This valuable service to the state won further  promotion for Mr. McCall, and when the of-  fice of superintendent of insurance became  vacant in 1883, Governor Grover Cleveland  elevated him to that position. As was easy  to foresee, his administration of the depart-  ment was a distinguished success. During his  term of office many reforms were instituted,  and a healthful condition of the insurance  business maintained throughout the state. No  insurance company in the commonwealth  failed in that time, and the department not  only paid the expenses of its maintenance, but  was able to turn over a handsome stun to the  state treasury. Upon the expiration of his  term of office, Governor David Hill tendered  a reappointment to Mr. McCall, but he de-  clined the offer, and accepted instead the office  of Comptroller of the Equitable Life Assur-  ance Society. In 1892, upon a change in the  management of the New York Life Insurance  Company, Mr. McCall was invited to take  the presidency of that institution. Under his  administration the rebuilding and extension of  the company's building at Broadway and  Leonard Street, making it a conspicuous ob-  ject in the city's great thoroughfare, was un-  dertaken and completed. Mr. McCall lived on  the west side near Central Park, and although  the cares of his official position left him scant  time for club life, he belonged to the Metro-  politan, City, Manhattan. Colonial, Merchants'  and Lawyers' clubs. His death occurred on  February 18, 1906.   He married Mnry T.. daughter of John and  Rose (Smythe) Horan. Children: i.

He was appointed assistant  •secretary, December 15, 1900; secretary, May  13, 1903; and was elected to the second vice-  presidency of the company, October 12, 1909,  an office he is filling at the present time.

Very little has been discovered concern-  ing him. He may have been named for  an uncle, as there was an Adam Rees  at Niskayuna, Schenectady county. New     York. The baptism of the eldest child of  Pieter Casparszen Van Norden was wit-  nessed by Elizabeth, daughter of Captain  Cregier, of Niskayuna, and there was prob-  ably visiting between the Rees and Van Nor-  den families.

He was reared in his native city,  and there received his primary education. En-  tering Hamilton College, he was graduated  valedictorian of his class with the degree of  Bachelor of .Vrts in 1863, following which he  entered the Union Theological Seminary, from  which he graduated in 1866. In that year he  was ordained to the Congregational ministry,  and was pastor of a church in New Orleans  for two years succeeding. From 1868 to 1873  he was in charge of the Congregational church  at Beverly, Massachusetts, and for ten years  following at St. Albans, Vermont. From 1883  to 1886 he was pastor of the North Street  Congregational Church of Springfield, Massa-  chusetts, and for a year following was stated  supply at Chicopee Center, ^Lassachusetts.  From 1890 to 1893 he was president of Elmira  (New York) College, and for the following  ten years he was engaged in a business enter-  prise, being resident director of the South  Yuba Water Company and the Central Cali-  fornia Electric Company (California) from  1893 to '905' when he retired to private life,  and engaged extensively in literary activity.  .'Xmong his publications are: 'The Outermost  Rim and Beyond,' 1882; 'The Psychic Fac-  tor,' 1894: 'Jesus, an Unfinished Portrait.'  1906; 'Yoland of Idle Isle' (a romance),  1907. He was a contributor for many years  to magazines and periodicals. In 1887 New  York University conferred upon him the de-  gree of Doctory of Divinity, and in 1892 he  received from Hamilton College the degree of  Doctor of Laws. Trained to the ministry he  was, from his first pastorate in 1868. a  preacher of much force and spirituality, and  a great power for good in his cviinmunity.  When president of Elmira College, and later  as resident director of the South Yuba Water  Company and the Central California Electric  Company, both large California enterprises, he  showed ingenuity, courage, executive ability  and foresight of a very high order. In those  pioneer days of electrical development ( 1894)  at a time when even electrical experts doubted,  he projected and built one of the first great  electrical transmission systems, and may be  truly said to have been a pioneer in that line.  An author of note, his courage, strength of     502     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     opinion, matured judgment, high moral stand-  ard, sympathy, and uprightness of Hfe made  him a leader in his community, and won for  him the love and lasting respect of all who  knew him or came in contact with him.

(IX) Ottomar Hoghland, the third son of  Rev. Charles and Anna Hubbell (Mygatt)  Van Norden, was born June i, 1878, at St.  Albans, Vermont.

In September. 1895, ^ic entered Le-  land Stanford Junior University, Palo Alto,  California, and graduated from there in June,  1899, with the degree of Bachelor of Arts.  During his college course he was a member of  the Kappa Alpha (Southern) fraternity.  After completing his college course, he became  associated with the Central California Elec-  tric Company at Sacramento as business man-  ager. In November, 1902, he removed from  Sacramento, California, to New York City,  and made his residence there. In 1903 he be-  came secretary and treasurer of the Van Nor-  den Safe Deposit Company, and also filled the  same offices with the Fifth Avenue Estates  Company, retaining these positions until the  latter part of 1908, when he resigned and  shortly thereafter entered the business of in-  vestment securities, with offices in the financial  district. As a member of the Camp Fire Club  of America, he became a member of the con-  servation committee of that club, and became  active in the promotion of legislation calcu-  lated to protect the game and forests of the  state. In T910 he became president of tlic  Long Island Game Protective Association, an     organization active in both nation and state  in advocating better laws for the protection  of the 'Wild Lue of Long Island,' and for  the better enforcement of the game laws  there.   He married, December 18, 1907, Jeanie  Belle Duncan, a resident of New York City,  born in New York, January 11, 1878, daugh-  ter of John Paterson and Susan (Stuart)  Duncan, of Scotch ancestry. Children : Hogh-  land, born March 5, 1909, at New York City;  Duncan, born December 2, 1910, at New York  City.     The fact is well known that  POLHEMUS surnames were in but par-  tial use among the early  Dutch settlers in America. Some show no trace  of ever having had surnames ana are recorded  only under patronymics. This soon became  inconvenient, and it is improbable that such  a usage could have long continued after the  Dutch colonies passed under the sway of Eng-  land. Thus, very soon after the settlement  by the Dutch, we find surnames coming into  regular and universal use. Not, however, in  general can this be said to have been a re-  sumption of a surname formerly used by the  family in Holland, and temporarily laid aside  in America. Two large classes of Dutch  surnames in America may be easily traced in  the early history of the colonies, or among  the families of Dutch descent at the present  day. Many changed the use of their patrony-  mics into that of surnames, handing them on  to their descendants as family designations  really only appropriate to themselves ; for ex-  ample, Remsen, originally designating an indi-  vidual as the son of a man named Rem. has  now become a family name. Others took  their surnames from the places of family abode  in Holland, often prefixing the preposition  'van,' meaning from ; thus. Van Horn. In  some cases two or more surnames are found  today among the desccndents of the same im-  migrant ancestor, not all the children, or not  all the dcscendents, having assumed the same  kind of surname .'\ striking instance of this  is found in the Lent family, which is a part  of the family more commonly denominated  Riker. But the present family belongs to  none of these classes. Perhaps it is due to  the superior education and social position of     SOUTHERN NEW YORK     503     their immigrant ancestor that they have con-  tinually used in America, a surname which  may be found in Holland, and was eminent  in that country long before the discovery of  America, for this name has for a long time  held a distinguished place among officers of  state and men of letters in the Netherlands.  Some of those of this name enjoyed celebrity  in the cities of Antwerp and Ghent; in Ant-  werp, Eleazer Polhemus, a learned jurist, held  the office of burgomaster as early as  13 10. The family is in Holland an armor-  bearing family.   (I) Rev. Johannes Theodoras Polhemus  died June 9, 1676. By him the name was  spelled Polhemius, and among his descendents  have been found such forms as Polhemes,  Polmes, and Polhemels. Of all the Americans  of this name, however spelled. Rev. Johannes  Theodoras Polhemus is the progenitor. A  probable line to some of his descendents in  Rockland county. New York, at the present  day, is given herewith. Rev. Johannes Theo-  doras Polhemus was a minister of the Re-  formed church of Holland, and emigrated, in  the employment of the Dutch West India  Company, from the Netherlands, to Itamarca,  Brazil. Thence he came, in 1654, to New  Amsterdam. Immediately he accepted a call  from the Dutch church at Flatbush, and took  up his residence at that village, on long Island.  New York. His connection with the churcn  at Flatbush ceased in 1665, and from that  time till his decease his services were given  to the Brooklyn congregation. June 25, 1662.  he obtained a patent for twenty-five morgens  of land at Flatbush, and he bought, about two  years later, an adjoining patent of twenty-four  morgens. In recording the death of their  'worthy and beloved pastor,' the members  cf the Brooklyn church deplored the loss of  his 'pious instructions, godly example, and  edifying preaching.' He married, in Holland  or Brazil, Catherine Van Werven, who sur-  vived him many years. Children : Theodoras,  married, October 14. 1677, Aertie Bagart;  Daniel, of whom further; Elizabeth, married  Denys Teunisz ; Adriana, married John Roel-  ofse Seubering; Anna, married Cornelius  Barentse Van Wyck : Lammetie, married Jo-  hannes Willemse; Margrietje, married Wil-  liam Guilliamse Cornell; and (probably)  Catrina.     (II) Daniel, son of Rev. Johannes Theo-  dorus and Catherine (Van Werven) Polhe-  mus, died, probably in New York City, in or  just before 1730. He resided at Flatbush;  there he was on the patent of 1685, took the  cath of allegiance to the English in 1687, and  was cornet of horse in i6(K). He was cap-  tain of the Kings county troop, and, in 1705,  supervisor of Flatbush; afterwards he was  county judge. He probably removed at a  later time to New York City, as he and his  wife Cornelia joined the Dutch church in  New York on certificate. He married (first)  August 13, 1685, Neeltie. daughter of Cor-  nelius Vanderveer, of Flatbush ; (second) Cor-  nelia .

He married, at Tappan,  Rockland county, New York, December 8,  1786, Elizabeth Eckerson. This date is, how-  ever, probably that of the registration and  not that of the actual marriage. According  to the church record both he and his wife were  of New Hempstead, which is now Clarkstown.  Child: Thecdorus, of whom further.   (VI) Theodorus, son of Jacob (2) and  Elizabeth (Eckerson) Polhemus, was born  April 22. 1 791, baptized and therefore prob-  ably born, at Clarkstown.

The  name has also become well known in the  United States where several members of the  family have long been among the most promi-  nent citizens in the professional and commer-  cial life of the country.

April 12 or 26, 1685, Ariaentje (or Arrietta)  Bloodgood, who belonged to a family living at  Flushing. They had several children, but  there is a record of the name of only one,  Joseph.   (HI) Joseph, son of Hendrick and Ariaen-  tje (Bloodgood) Hegeman, was born at Flat-  bush, about 1687, died in 1741. He owned  a great deal of land and speculated to some  extent in it.
